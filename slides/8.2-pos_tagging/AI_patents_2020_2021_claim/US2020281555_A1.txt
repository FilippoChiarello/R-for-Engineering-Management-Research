MEDICAL APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
A medical apparatus of embodiments includes processing circuitry. The processing circuitry is configured to input third projection data to a first trained model to generate fourth projection data, the first trained model being generated through learning using first projection data collected by a first X-ray detector included in a first scanner and relatively greatly affected by scattered rays as learning data of an input side and using second projection data relatively less affected by scattered rays as learning data of an output side, the first trained model being configured to generate, on the basis of the third projection data collected by a second X-ray detector included in a second scanner, the fourth projection data in which the influence of scattered rays in the third projection data has been reduced. The first projection data is collected by the first X-ray detector in a case where a collimator provided in a first X-ray source included in the first scanner has a first opening width. The second projection data is collected by the first X-ray detector in a case where the collimator has an opening width smaller than the first opening width.
