METHODS AND APPARATUSES FOR COLLECTION OF ULTRASOUND DATA
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the technology described herein relate to a processing device in operative communication with an ultrasound device, where the processing device is configured to capture video with a front-facing camera and display, simultaneously, the video and an instruction for moving the ultrasound device. The video may depict the ultrasound device and portions of the user near the ultrasound device. The processing device may further display, simultaneously with the video and the instruction, an ultrasound image generated based on ultrasound data received from the ultrasound device. The instruction may be an instruction for moving the ultrasound device from a current position and orientation relative to the user to a target position and orientation relative to the user.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. An apparatus, comprising:
a processing device in operative communication with an ultrasound device, the processing device configured to:
capture video with a front-facing camera on the processing device; and display, simultaneously, the video and an instruction for moving the ultrasound device.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the video depicts the ultrasound device and portions of a user near the ultrasound device.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processing device is further configured to receive, from the ultrasound device, ultrasound data collected from a user.
4. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the processing device is further configured to display, simultaneously with the video and the instruction, an ultrasound image generated based on the ultrasound data.
5. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the instruction is generated based on the ultrasound data.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the instruction comprises an instruction for moving the ultrasound device from a current position and orientation relative to a user to a target position and orientation relative to the user.
7. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the instruction comprises a directional indicator superimposed on the video.
8. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein the directional indicator comprises an arrow.
9. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the video and the instruction comprise an augmented-reality interface.
10. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processing device is further configured to generate the instruction.
11. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processing device is configured to receive the instruction from another processing device associated with a remote expert.
12. A method, comprising:
capturing video with a front-facing camera on a processing device in operative communication with an ultrasound device; and
displaying, simultaneously, the video and an instruction for moving the ultrasound device.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the video depicts the ultrasound device and portions of a user near the ultrasound device.
14. The method of claim 12, further comprising receiving, from the ultrasound device, ultrasound data collected from a user.
15. The method of claim 14, further comprising displaying, simultaneously with the video and the instruction, an ultrasound image generated based on the ultrasound data.
16. The method of claim 14, wherein the instruction is generated based on the ultrasound data.
17. The method of claim 12, wherein the instruction comprises an instruction for moving the ultrasound device from a current position and orientation relative to a user to a target position and orientation relative to the user.
18. The method of claim 12, wherein the instruction comprises a directional indicator superimposed on the video.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the directional indicator comprises an arrow.
20. The method of claim 12, wherein the video and the instruction comprise an augmented-reality interface.
21. The method of claim 12, further comprising generating the instruction.
22. The method of claim 12, further comprising receiving the instruction from another processing device associated with a remote expert.
