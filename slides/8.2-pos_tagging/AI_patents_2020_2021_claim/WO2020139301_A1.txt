<title>
AN ANOMALY DETECTION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a system whereby anomaly detection is performed by using machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence technology in a time series. With the inventive system (1); the most appropriate estimation method of each KPI (key performance indicator), that will be monitored by time series and has a unique characteristic structure, for characteristic structure is detected by artificial intelligence.

<claims>
1. A system (1) for performing anomaly detection in a time series characterized by:
at least one data collection module (2) which collects and records data from various source systems;
at least one analysis unit (3) which is in communication with the data collection module (2), wherein collected data is analysed, usual behaviour trend is created by dealing with a certain time series of data, unusual behaviours are eliminated and temporal estimates of each action are created together with the given character analysis and the eliminated data; and
at least one alarm unit (4) which is in communication with the analysis unit (3) and transforms abnormal behaviours of an action into alarm and shares it with external systems.
2. A system (1) according to Claim 1; characterized by the data collection module (2) which is in communication with the analysis unit (3) and carries out data collection transaction from external systems.
3. A system (1) according to Claim 1 or 2; characterized by the data analysis unit (3) wherein character analysis is done at first, then unusual behaviours are filtered and temporal estimates of each action are created on the data kept on the data collection module (2).
4. A system (1) according to any of the preceding claims; characterized by the analysis unit (3) determines usual behaviour trend by considering a certain time series of data in the data collection module (2).
5. A system (1) according to any of the preceding claims; characterized by the analysis unit (3) which determines and eliminates unusual behaviours by using the information of behaviour trend determined by it.
6. A system (1) according to any of the preceding claims; characterized by the analysis unit (3) which creates temporal estimates of each action together with the character analysis created by the usual behaviour trend and the eliminated unusual behaviours.
7. A system (1) according to any of the preceding claims; characterized by the analysis unit (3) which determines correlative trends by using artificial intelligence technology.
8. A system (1) according to Claim 7; characterized by the alarm unit (4) which makes query on correlative trends and reflects the query result on the generated alarm score in the event that the analysis unit (3) detects anomaly over correlative trends.
9. A system (1) according to Claim 7 or 8; characterized by the alarm unit (4) which is a unit that transforms abnormal behaviours of an action into alarm and which scores the alarm generated by correlative alarm scoring method and gives information about the alarm level.
10. A system (1) according to any of the preceding claims; characterized by the alarm unit (4) which decides on which alarms will be sent to the end user by machine learning method on alarms generated by it.
11. A system (1) according to any of the preceding claims; characterized by the alarm unit (4) which is in communication with user and receives true or false feedbacks from user about the generated alarms and creates a learning structure.
