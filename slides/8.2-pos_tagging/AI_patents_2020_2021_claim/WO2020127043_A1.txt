A VEHICLE COMPRISING A DISPLAY DEVICE AND AN ELECTRONIC CONTROL UNIT
</title>

<abstract>
The invention is concerned with a vehicle (10) comprising a display device (30) with a graphical user interface (31) and an electronic control unit (41). The graphical user interface (31) is designed for displaying at least one graphic display object (32, 33, 34, 35, 36). The electronic control unit (41) is designed to receive an orientation signal (X) of at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15), wherein the orientation signal (X) comprises information about a position and/or an orientation of the vehicle element (13, 14, 15) being in a first element position and/or orientation (P1). The electronic control unit (41) is designed to adjust a position of the graphical user interface (31) as a function of the orientation signal (X), such that a relative position of the graphical user interface (31) relative to the at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15) lies within a predefined tolerance.

<claims>
1. Vehicle (10) comprising:
- a display device (30) comprising a graphical user interface (31 ) which is designed to display at least one graphic display object
(32, 33, 34, 35, 36) and to receive at least one input signal; and
- an electronic control unit (41 ) which is designed to receive the at least one input signal from the display device (30) and transmit the input signal to at least one device in the vehicle (10) and/or to receive at least one functionality signal from the at least one de vice in the vehicle (10) and transmit the at least one functionality signal as an output signal to the display device (30), characterized in that
- the electronic control unit (41 ) is designed to receive an orientation signal (X) of at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15), wherein the orientation signal (X) comprises information about a position and/or an orientation of the at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15) being in a first element position and/or orientation (P1 ); and
- the electronic control unit (41 ) is designed to adjust a position of the graphical user interface (31 ) as a function of the orientation signal (X) of the at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15), such that a relative position of the graphical user interface (31 ) relative to the at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15) lies within a predefined tolerance.
2. Vehicle (10) according to claim 1 , wherein the graphical user interface (31 ) comprises a pixel matrix. 3. Vehicle (10) according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the display device (30) comprises a control circuitry (37), wherein the control circuitry (37) is designed to actuate at least one pixel element of the pixel matrix for displaying the at least one graphic display object (32, 33, 34, 35, 36), wherein in a non-actuated state each pixel element is transparent, wherein a movement of the graphical user interface (31 ), in order to ad just the position of the graphical user interface (31 ), is achieved by shift ing an actuation of pixel elements of the pixel matrix.
4. Vehicle (10) according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the graphical user interface (31 ) is integrated into a window panel (38) of a door (39) of the vehicle (10), such that the graphical user interface (31 ) occupies at least a part of the window panel (38).
Vehicle (10) according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15) is a vehicle seat (13).
Vehicle (10) according to claim 5, wherein the electronic control unit (41 ) is designed to compute an estimated head-position (H) of a head of a user (12) sitting on the vehicle seat (13) from the orientation signal (X) of the vehicle seat (13), wherein the electronic control unit (41 ) is de signed to adjust the position of the graphical user interface (31 ) in ac cordance with the estimated head-position (H), such that the relative position of the graphical user interface (31 ) relative to the estimated head-position (H) lies within a predefined tolerance.
Vehicle (10) according to claim 1 , wherein the display device (30) is attached to an edge (63) of a window panel (38) of a door (39) of the vehicle (10) by means of an holding arrangement, wherein the holding arrangement is designed to be movable.
Vehicle (10) according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the vehi cle (10) comprises a gaze monitoring unit (62) which is designed to monitor a position and/or orientation of a head of a user (12), wherein the electronic control unit (41 ) is designed to adjust the position of the graphical user interface (31 ) in accordance with the monitored position and/or orientation of the head of the user (12), wherein a correction vec tor for correcting the information from the orientation signal (X) is esti mated, such that the relative position of the graphical user interface (31 ) relative to the head of the user (12) lies within a predefined tolerance.
Vehicle (10) according to any of the preceding claims, wherein
- the electronic control unit (41 ) is designed to receive an activa tion signal (A) for the at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15), wherein the activation signal (A) is received from a user (12) through the graphical user interface (31 ), wherein the activation signal (A) comprises information about a desired position and/or orientation (P2) of the at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15); and
- the electronic control unit (41 ) is designed to adjust the position and/or orientation of the at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15) from the first element position and/or orientation (P1 ) to a desired element position and/or orientation (P2) as a function of the acti vation signal (A) for the at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15).
10. Vehicle (10) according to claim 9, wherein
- the electronic control unit (41 ) is designed to receive the orientation signal (X) of the at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15) during and/or after the adjusting of the position and/or orientation of the at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15), wherein the ori entation signal (X) comprises information about the position and/or orientation of the at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15) being in the desired element position and/or orientation (P2); and
- the electronic control unit (41 ) is designed to adjust the position of the graphical user interface (31 ) as a function of the orienta tion signal of the at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15), such that the relative position of the graphical user interface (31 ) relative to the at least one vehicle element (13, 14, 15) in the desired element position and/or orientation (P2) lies within the predefined tolerance.
