<title>
APPARATUS, METHOD, AND PROGRAM FOR LEARNING DISCRIMINATOR DISCRIMINATING INFARCTION REGION, DISCRIMINATOR FOR DISCRIMINATING INFARCTION REGION, AND APPARATUS, METHOD, AND PROGRAM FOR DISCRIMINATING INFARCTION REGION
</title>

<abstract>
An image acquisition unit acquires a CT image and one or more MRI images of the brain of a subject that has developed a cerebral infarction. An infarction region extraction unit extracts an infarction region corresponding to the time elapsed since the development from the MRI image. A registration unit performs registration between the CT image and the MRI image. An infarction region specification unit specifies the infarction region corresponding to the time elapsed since the development in the CT image on the basis of the result of the registration. A learning unit learns a discriminator which discriminates an infarction region corresponding to the time elapsed since the development in the CT image to be discriminated, using the infarction region corresponding to the time elapsed since the development, which has been specified in the CT image, as teacher data.

<claims>
1. A discriminator learning apparatus comprising: an image acquisition unit that acquires a CT image of a brain of a subject that has developed a cerebral infarction and at least one brain image of the subject acquired by a modality different from a CT apparatus which acquires the CT image; an infarction region extraction unit that extracts an infarction region corresponding to a time elapsed since the development from the brain image on the basis of at least the brain image; a registration unit that performs registration between the CT image and the brain image; an infarction region specification unit that specifies the infarction region corresponding to the time elapsed since the development in the CT image on the basis of a result of the registration; and a learning unit that learns a discriminator which discriminates an infarction region corresponding to the time elapsed since the development in an input CT image, using the infarction region corresponding to the time elapsed since the development, which has been specified in the CT image, as teacher data.
2. The discriminator learning apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the brain image is an MRI image.
3. The discriminator learning apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the MRI image is at least one of a diffusion weighted image, a FLAIR image, or a T2-weighted image.
4. A discriminator that is learned by the discriminator learning apparatus according to claim 1.
5. An infarction region discrimination apparatus comprising: an image acquisition unit that acquires a CT image to be discriminated; and the discriminator according to claim 4 that discriminates an infarction region in the CT image to be discriminated according to a time elapsed since development.
6. The infarction region discrimination apparatus according to claim 5, further comprising: a display control unit that displays a discrimination result of the infarction region by the discriminator on a display unit.
7. A discriminator learning method comprising: acquiring a CT image of a brain of a subject that has developed a cerebral infarction and at least one brain image of the subject acquired by a modality different from a CT apparatus which acquires the CT image; extracting an infarction region corresponding to a time elapsed since the development from the brain image on the basis of at least the brain image; performing registration between the CT image and the brain image; specifying the infarction region corresponding to the time elapsed since the development in the CT image on the basis of a result of the registration; and learning a discriminator which discriminates an infarction region corresponding to the time elapsed since the development in an input CT image, using the infarction region corresponding to the time elapsed since the development, which has been specified in the CT image, as teacher data.
8. An infarction region discrimination method comprising: acquiring a CT image to be discriminated; and discriminating an infarction region in the CT image to be discriminated according to a time elapsed since development, using the discriminator according to claim 4.
9. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium that stores a discriminator learning program that causes a computer to perform: acquiring a CT image of a brain of a subject that has developed a cerebral infarction and at least one brain image of the subject acquired by a modality different from a CT apparatus which acquires the CT image; extracting an infarction region corresponding to a time elapsed since the development from the brain image on the basis of at least the brain image; performing registration between the CT image and the brain image; specifying the infarction region corresponding to the time elapsed since the development in the CT image on the basis of a result of the registration; and learning a discriminator which discriminates an infarction region corresponding to the time elapsed since the development in an input CT image, using the infarction region corresponding to the time elapsed since the development, which has been specified in the CT image, as teacher data.
10. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium that stores an infarction region discrimination program that causes a computer to perform: acquiring a CT image to be discriminated; and discriminating an infarction region in the CT image to be discriminated according to a time elapsed since development, using the discriminator according to claim 4.
