SYSTEM AND METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An estimation unit provides an estimation result using a trained model generated by machine learning which is trained using training data that includes input data representing document data about documents read from a plurality of MFPs and teaching data representing collected setting data about each of the documents read from the plurality of MFPs. A setting unit transmits, for a particular document read by the MFP, an estimation request to the estimation apparatus along with document data about the document read by the MFP, and receives the estimation result, and sets an output setting of the document based on the received estimation result.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: an estimation apparatus; and an MFP, wherein the estimation apparatus includes a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing a program; and a data processing unit communicatively connected to the non-transitory computer-readable storage medium and configured at least by the program at least to function as: an estimation unit configured to provide an estimation result using a trained model generated by machine learning which is trained using training data that includes input data representing document data about documents read from a plurality of MFPs and teaching data representing collected setting data about each of the documents read from the plurality of MFPs, the MFP includes a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing a program; and a data processing unit communicatively connected to the non-transitory computer-readable storage medium and configured at least by the program at least to function as: a setting unit configured to transmit, for a particular document read by the MFP, an estimation request to the estimation apparatus along with document data about the document read by the MFP, and receive the estimation result, and set an output setting of the document based on the received estimation result.
2. The system according to claim 1, wherein the setting unit is configured to, if instructed not to use estimation based on the trained model, set a default copy setting retained by the MFP or a copy setting instructed to be recorded by a user without transmitting the estimation request.
3. The system according to claim 1, wherein the estimation result based on the trained model is available for all users using the MFP in common, and wherein the setting unit is configured to, if a specific trained model is absent, make a copy setting based on the estimation result based on the trained model.
4. The system according to claim 1, wherein the estimation apparatus includes trained models generated user by user, and wherein the setting unit is configured to, if the MFP has a login function, a user logging in to the MFP is identified, and there is a trained model associated with the user logging in, make a copy setting based on an estimation result based on the trained model associated with the user logging in.
5. The system according to claim 1, wherein the estimation apparatus includes trained models generated tenant by tenant, and wherein the setting is configured to, if a tenant is identified from an issued authorization token and there is a trained model associated with the identified tenant, make a copy setting based on an estimation result based on the trained model associated with the identified tenant.
6. The system according to claim 1, wherein the document data includes sheet size information about the document, page number information, and scan data generated by reading the document, and wherein the setting data includes color setting information, page aggregation setting information, two-sided setting information, and output sheet size setting information.
7. A method for controlling a system including an estimation apparatus and an MFP, the method comprising: providing an estimation result using a trained model generated by machine learning which is trained using training data that includes input data representing document data about documents read from a plurality of MFPs and teaching data representing collected setting data about each of the documents read from the plurality of MFPs; and transmitting, for a particular document read by the MFP, an estimation request to the estimation apparatus along with document data about the document read by the MFP, and receiving the estimation result, and setting an output setting of the document based on the received estimation result.
