VOICE SYNTHESIS METHOD, VOICE SYNTHESIS DEVICE, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
A voice synthesis apparatus includes: an intermediate trained model configured to generate second control data according to first input data including first control data designating phonetic identifiers; an editing processor configured to change the second control data in accordance with a first instruction provided by a user; a final trained model configured to generate, according to final input data including the first control data and the changed second control data, synthesis data representing frequency characteristics of a voice to be synthesized; and a synthesis processor configured to generate a voice signal based on the generated synthesis data.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented voice synthesis method comprising: generating second control data using an intermediate trained model with first input data including first control data designating phonetic identifiers; changing the second control data in accordance with a first instruction provided by a user; generating synthesis data representing frequency characteristics of a voice to be synthesized using a final trained model with final input data including the first control data and the changed second control data; and generating a voice signal based on the generated synthesis data.
2. The voice synthesis method according to claim 1, wherein: the intermediate trained model is a first trained model configured to generate the second control data according to the first input data including the first control data, and the second control data represents phonemes of the voice to be synthesized.
3. The voice synthesis method according to claim 2, further comprising: generating third control data representing expressions of the voice to be synthesized using a second trained model with second input data including the first control data and the changed second control data; and changing the third control data in accordance with a second instruction provided by the user, wherein the synthesis data is generated according to the final input data including the first control data, the changed second control data, and the changed third control data.
4. The voice synthesis method according to claim 1, wherein the second control data represents phonemes and expressions of the voice to be synthesized.
5. The voice synthesis method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, further comprising: changing the synthesis data in accordance with a third instruction provided by the user, wherein the generating of the voice signal includes generating the voice signal according to the changed synthesis data.
6. A voice synthesis apparatus comprising: an intermediate trained model configured to generate second control data according to first input data including first control data designating phonetic identifiers; an editing processor configured to change the second control data in accordance with a first instruction provided by a user; a final trained model configured to generate, according to final input data including the first control data and the changed second control data, synthesis data representing frequency characteristics of a voice to be synthesized; and a synthesis processor configured to generate a voice signal based on the generated synthesis data.
7. A computer program for causing a computer to function as: an intermediate trained model configured to generate second control data according to first input data including first control data designating phonetic identifiers; an editing processor configured to change the second control data in accordance with a first instruction provided by a user; a final trained model configured to generate, according to final input data including the first control data and the changed second control data, synthesis data representing frequency characteristics of a voice to be synthesized; and a synthesis processor configured to generate a voice signal based on the generated synthesis data.
