NETWORK NODE AND METHOD IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
A method performed by a network node, for planning radio resources for transmissions is provided. The network node establishes (301) that a wireless device is fixed, wherein fixed comprises always being served by the same one or more access points. The network node obtains (302) a configuration comprising an identity of the wireless device and associated parameters to be used for transmissions between the network node and the wireless device. The parameters comprise an identity of the one or more access points serving the wireless device. The parameters further comprise any one or more out of: Time and periodicity, for transmissions between the network node and the wireless device. Based on the configuration, the network node plans (303) radio resources available in the network node for upcoming transmissions between the network node and any wireless device.
