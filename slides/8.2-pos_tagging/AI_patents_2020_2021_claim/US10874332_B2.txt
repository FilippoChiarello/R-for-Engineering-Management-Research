Respiration monitor
</title>

<abstract>
A system for respiration monitoring includes a garment, which is configured to be fitted snugly around a body of a human subject, and which includes, on at least a portion of the garment that fits around a thorax of the subject, a pattern of light and dark pigments having a high contrast at a near infrared wavelength. A camera head is configured to be mounted in proximity to a bed in which the subject is to be placed, and includes an image sensor and an infrared illumination source, which is configured to illuminate the bed with radiation at the near infrared wavelength, and is configured to transmit a video stream of images of the subject in the bed captured by the image sensor to a processor, which analyzes movement of the pattern in the images in order to detect a respiratory motion of the thorax.

<claims>
1. A system for respiration monitoring, comprising: a band, having a size and shape suitable to surround and be fastened snugly around a thorax of an infant, and which comprises a pattern of light and dark pigments having a high contrast at a near infrared wavelength and extending around a front, a back and sides of the thorax, while leaving the infant free to move his or her arms and legs; and a camera head, which is configured to be mounted in proximity to a bed in which the infant is to be placed, and which comprises an image sensor and an infrared illumination source, which is configured to illuminate the bed with radiation at the near infrared wavelength, and which is configured to transmit a video stream of images of the infant in the bed captured by the image sensor to a processor, which analyzes movement of the pattern in the images in order to detect a respiratory motion of the thorax regardless of whether the infant is lying on his or her front, back or side.
2. The system according to claim 1, wherein the pattern comprises an arrangement of light or dark geometrical shapes, which repeat across at least the portion of the garment, and wherein the processor is configured to identify and track the geometrical shapes in the images in order to analyze the movement.
3. The system according to claim 2, wherein the shapes have respective corners, and wherein the processor is configured to identify and track the corners in the images in order to analyze the movement.
4. The system accordingly to claim 2, wherein the processor is configured to calibrate a scale of the images responsively to a distance between the repeating shapes.
5. The system according to claim 4, wherein the processor is configured to apply the scale in measuring the respiratory motion.
6. The system according to claim 4, wherein the processor is configured to apply the scale in measuring one or more dimensions of the infant.
7. The system according to claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to identify, responsively to the movement of the pattern, a deviation of at least one of an amplitude and a rate of the respiratory motion from a predefined normal range, and to issue an alert in response to the deviation.
8. A method for respiration monitoring, comprising: providing a band, having a size and shape suitable to surround and be fastened snugly around a thorax of an infant, and which comprises a pattern of light and dark pigments having a high contrast at a near infrared wavelength and extending around a front, a back and sides of the thorax, while leaving the infant free to move his or her arms and legs; and illuminating a bed in which the infant is placed with radiation at the near infrared wavelength; capturing a video stream of images of the infant in the bed while illuminating the bed at the near infrared wavelength; and analyzing movement of the pattern in the images in order to detect a respiratory motion of the thorax regardless of whether the infant is lying on his or her front, back or side.
9. The method according to claim 8, wherein the pattern comprises an arrangement of light or dark geometrical shapes, which repeat across at least the portion of the swaddling garment, and wherein analyzing the movement comprises identifying and tracking the geometrical shapes in the images.
10. The method according to claim 9, wherein the shapes have respective corners, and wherein identifying and tracking the geometrical shapes comprises identifying and tracking the corners in the images.
11. The method accordingly to claim 9, wherein identifying and tracking the geometrical shapes comprises calibrating a scale of the images responsively to a distance between the repeating shapes.
12. The method according to claim 11, wherein analyzing the movement comprises applying the scale in measuring the respiratory motion.
13. The method according to claim 11, and comprising applying the scale in measuring one or more dimensions of the infant.
14. The method according to claim 8, wherein analyzing the movement comprises identifying, responsively to the movement of the pattern, a deviation of at least one of an amplitude and a rate of the respiratory motion from a predefined normal range, and issuing an alert in response to the deviation.
15. The method according to claim 11, and comprising analyzing the movement so as to measure a distance traveled by the infant in the bed.
16. The system according to claim 1, wherein the pattern is printed over an entire area of the band.
17. The system according to claim 1, wherein the band comprises hook and loop patches, which fasten the band snugly around the thorax of the infant.
