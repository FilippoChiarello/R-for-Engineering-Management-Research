<title>
AUXILIARY POWER UNIT AIR CONDITIONING FOR TRUCK CAB COOLING
</title>

<abstract>
Systems are disclosed for providing a work vehicle with a second air conditioning compressor driven by a small engine mounted on the work vehicle. The second compressor shares a refrigeration loop with the primary air conditioning compressor of the work vehicle. The small engine may be configured to drive various loads, and accordingly may include control circuitry to manage the power provided to the various loads, including the second compressor.

<claims>
1. An auxiliary compressor control system comprising: an auxiliary compressor selectively driven by an auxiliary engine; and one or more conduits connected to the auxiliary compressor, the auxiliary compressor to selectively pump fluid through a coolant loop of a cooling system integrated within a vehicle via the one or more conduits, wherein the cooling system is connected to a vehicle compressor driven by a vehicle engine.
2. The auxiliary compressor control system as defined in claim 1, further comprising one or more valves configured to selectively channel fluid from one of the auxiliary compressor or the vehicle compressor through the coolant loop.
3. The auxiliary compressor control system as defined in claim 1, further comprising a controller to: receive control signals to activate the cooling system; and control the auxiliary engine or the auxiliary compressor based on the control signals.
4. The auxiliary compressor control system as defined in claim 3, wherein the cooling system comprises a cooling control system operable to receive inputs from one or more sensors, a user interface, or a vehicle control system.
5. The auxiliary compressor control system as defined in claim 4, wherein the cooling system comprises a cooling control system to generate the control signals based on the received inputs
6. The auxiliary compressor control system as defined in claim 3, wherein the controller further comprises a memory storage device that includes a list of threshold power characteristic values corresponding to a power allocation scheme for one or more auxiliary devices including the auxiliary compressor, the auxiliary generator, a battery charger, or a welding-type power output.
7. The auxiliary compressor control system as defined in claim 6, wherein the controller is further configured to: receive power characteristics corresponding to the one or more auxiliary devices; compare the received power characteristics to the list of threshold power characteristics; and adjust power output to one or more of the one or more auxiliary devices based on the comparison.
8. The auxiliary compressor control system as defined in claim 3, wherein the controller is operable to increase a speed of the auxiliary engine to drive the auxiliary compressor in response to the control signals.
9. The auxiliary compressor control system as defined in claim 3, wherein the controller is operable to control the clutch to activate to drive the auxiliary compressor in response to the control signals.
10. The auxiliary compressor control system as defined in claim 3, wherein the controller is further configured to: receive control signals to deactivate the cooling system; receive data that the vehicle compressor is not being driven by the vehicle engine; and control the engine to drive the auxiliary compressor based on the control signals.
11. The auxiliary compressor control system as defined in claim 1, wherein the controller is further operable to receive vehicle engine state information from a vehicle control system.
12. The auxiliary compressor control system as defined in claim 3, wherein the controller is further operable to transmit or receive information to or from the vehicle control system via a wired or a wireless communications interface.
13. A power system comprising: an enclosure comprising: an auxiliary engine; an auxiliary compressor selectively driven by the auxiliary engine via a clutch; and one or more conduits connected to the auxiliary compressor, the auxiliary compressor to selectively pump fluid through a coolant loop of a cooling system integrated within a vehicle via the one or more conduits, wherein the cooling system is connected to a vehicle compressor driven by a vehicle engine.
14. The power system as defined in claim 13, wherein the one or more conduits connect to the coolant loop via one or more valves.
15. The power system as defined in claim 14, wherein the one or more valves comprise a connector to secure or remove the one or conduits to the coolant loop.
16. The power system as defined in claim 13, further comprising a belt to operatively link the clutch to a shaft of the auxiliary compressor.
17. The power system as defined in claim 13, further comprising an energy storage device to provide mechanical power to drive the auxiliary compressor.
18. The power system as defined in claim 13, further comprising a controller to control the auxiliary engine or the auxiliary compressor when the vehicle compressor is not being driven by the vehicle engine.
19. The power system as defined in claim 13, wherein the controller is further configured to: receive control signals to activate the cooling system; receive data that the vehicle compressor is not being driven by the vehicle engine; and control the auxiliary engine to drive the auxiliary compressor based on the control signals and the data.
20. An auxiliary compressor control system comprising: an auxiliary compressor selectively driven by an auxiliary engine; one or more conduits connected to the auxiliary compressor, the auxiliary compressor to selectively pump fluid through a coolant loop of a cooling system via the one or more conduits, wherein the cooling system is connected to a primary compressor driven by a primary engine; and a controller to: receive control signals to activate the cooling system; receive control signals to activate the auxiliary compressor; and control the auxiliary engine to drive the auxiliary compressor based on the control signals.
