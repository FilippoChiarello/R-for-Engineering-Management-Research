<title>
Method, device, and system for computer-based cyber-secure natural language learning
</title>

<abstract>
A computing device learns a natural language. A mapper included in the computing device non-deterministically maps an input natural language sentential form to a matching semantic that is associated with a computer language function component. A translator included in the computing device translates the matching semantic into a translated natural language sentential form.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for learning a natural language by a computing device, comprising: storing associations of natural language sentential forms and semantics in a hash table, wherein the semantics are associated with respective computer language function components; storing context information corresponding to the semantics in a blackboard database; non-deterministically mapping, by a mapper included in the computing device, an input natural language sentential form to a matching semantic that is associated with a computer language function component by querying the hash table for the matching semantic associated with the input natural language sentential form; querying the blackboard database for the context information corresponding to the matching semantic if the matching semantic is not found in the hash table; querying an external system for information corresponding to the matching semantic if the matching semantic is not found in the hash table and the blackboard database does not contain the context information corresponding to the matching semantic; assigning a semantic that is associated with an equivalent natural language sentential form to the input natural language sentential form if there is no matching semantic associated with the input natural language sentential form; translating, by a translator included in the computing device, the matching semantic into a translated natural language sentential form.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein mapping further comprises reducing the input natural language sentential form to subsequences and mapping the subsequences to respective matching semantics if no matching semantic is found in the hash table.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein mapping the subsequences comprises querying a blackboard database for context information corresponding to the respective matching semantics.
4. The method of claim 2, further comprising assigning semantics to the subsequences if subsequences remain for which there are no respective matching semantics.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein many input natural language sentential forms are mapped to the matching semantic and wherein translating comprises inverse-hashing the matching semantic to many natural language sentential forms.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein translating further comprises selecting the translated natural language sentential form by chance from among the many natural language sentential forms.
7. A computing device for learning a natural language, comprising: a hash table configured to store associations of natural language sentential forms and semantics, wherein the semantics are associated with respective computer language function components; a blackboard database configured to store context information corresponding to the semantics; a mapper configured to non-deterministically map an input natural language sentential form to a matching semantic by querying the hash table for the matching semantic and, if the matching semantic is not found in the hash table, querying the blackboard database for the context information corresponding to the matching semantic, wherein the mapper is further configured to query an external system for information corresponding to the matching semantic if the matching semantic is not found in the hash table and the blackboard database does not contain the context information corresponding to the matching semantic, and wherein the mapper is further configured to assign a semantic that is associated with an equivalent natural language sentential form to the input natural language sentential form if there is no matching semantic associated with the input natural language sentential form; and a translator configured to translate the matching semantic into a translated natural language sentential form.
8. A computing device for learning a natural language, comprising: a hash table configured to store associations of natural language sentential forms and semantics, wherein the semantics are associated with respective computer language function components; a blackboard database configured to store context information corresponding to the semantics; a mapper configured to non-deterministically map an input natural language sentential form to a matching semantic by querying the hash table for the matching semantic and, if the matching semantic is not found in the hash table, querying the blackboard database for the context information corresponding to the matching semantic, wherein the mapper is further configured to query an external system for information corresponding to the matching semantic if the matching semantic is not found in the hash table and the blackboard database does not contain the context information corresponding to the matching semantic, and wherein the mapper is further configured to assign a semantic associated with a nearest matching natural language sentential form to the input natural language sentential form if there is no matching semantic associated with the input natural language sentential form; and a translator configured to translate the matching semantic into a translated natural language sentential form.
9. The computing device of claim 7, wherein the semantics include situation semantic objects paired with action semantic objects, each of the situation semantic objects and action semantic objects being associated with respective computer language function components.
10. The computing device of claim 7, further comprising an input/output interface configured to output the respective computer language function components for checking against valid computer language function components to provide for cyber-security.
