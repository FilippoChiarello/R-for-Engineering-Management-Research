AN UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE AND A CHARGING PLATFORM FOR AN UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) comprising: an electrical propulsion system; a battery for powering the electrical propulsion system; charging circuitry for charging the battery; a housing comprising a first plurality of arms extending outwardly from the housing for supporting the UAV on a charging platform that is smaller than the UAV, wherein the charging circuitry is configured to be charged using at least some of a plurality of contact charging pads, and wherein at least some of the plurality of contact charging pads are positioned on at least some of the first plurality of arms and extend over at least an underside portion of those arms.

<claims>
1 . An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) comprising:
an electrical propulsion system;
a battery for powering the electrical propulsion system;
charging circuitry for charging the battery;
a housing comprising a first plurality of arms extending outwardly from the housing for supporting the UAV on a charging platform that is smaller than the UAV,
wherein the charging circuitry is configured to be charged using at least some of a plurality of contact charging pads, and wherein at least some of the plurality of contact charging pads are positioned on at least some of the first plurality of arms and extend over at least an underside portion of those arms.
2. An unmanned aerial vehicle as claimed in claim 1 , wherein a span of the first plurality of arms exceeds a span of the charging platform.
3. An unmanned aerial vehicle as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein each of the plurality of contact charging pads is positioned on one of the first plurality of arms and extends over at least an underside portion of that arm, such that all contact charging pads of the unmanned aerial vehicle are positioned on one of the first plurality of arms.
4. An unmanned aerial vehicle as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the contact charging pads are sized and positioned to form discreet portions of a virtual anulus, wherein inner portions of the contact charging pads are located at an inner radius of the virtual anulus and outer portions of the contact charging pads are located at an outer radius of the virtual anulus.
5. An unmanned aerial vehicle as claimed in claim 4, wherein the inner radius of the virtual anulus is less than a radius of the charging platform and the outer radius of the virtual anulus is greater than the radius of the charging platform.
6. An unmanned aerial vehicle as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the contact charging pads are configured to have an abrasive surface.
7. An unmanned aerial vehicle as claimed in any preceding claim comprising means for detecting a relationship between the UAV and the charging platform that is sub-optimal for charging, and means for causing a change in the relationship between the UAV and the charging platform to enable optimal charging.
8. An unmanned aerial vehicle as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the UAV comprises a portion that extends below the contact charging pad, closer to ground, when the UAV is on the charging platform, wherein the portion is configured to prevent the UAV sliding off the charging platform.
9. An unmanned aerial vehicle as claimed in claim 8, wherein the portion that extends below the charging pads is funnel-shaped to control a position of the UAV relative to the charging platform, when the portion abuts the charging platform while being received within a void of the charging platform.
10. An unmanned aerial vehicle as claimed in claim 8, wherein the portion that extends below the charging pads is a moveable payload protector, configured to rotate in the horizontal about the payload.
1 1 . An unmanned aerial vehicle as claimed in any preceding claim, comprising peripheral bumpers at extremities of the arms.
12. A charging platform for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) comprising:
an exterior frame, bounding an interior void, configured to support outwardly extending arms of a UAV that is larger than the charging platform;
a plurality of contact charging pads for enabling charging of the UAV, wherein each of the plurality of contact charging pads is positioned on the frame and extends over at least an upper portion of the charging frame.
13. A charging platform as claimed in claim 12 wherein the exterior frame is an annular frame that defines an open-centered ring.
14. A charging platform as claimed in claim 12 or 13, further comprising means for moving the chargeable platform with respect to an enclosure.
15. A system comprising:
an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) comprising:
an electrical propulsion system for landing the UAV on a charging platform that is smaller than the UAV;
a battery for powering the electrical propulsion system;
charging circuitry for charging the battery,
a housing comprising a first plurality of arms extending outwardly from the housing for supporting the UAV on the charging platform,
wherein the charging circuitry is configured to be charged using at least some of a plurality of contact charging pads,
, and wherein at least some of the plurality of contact charging pads are positioned on at least some of the first plurality of arms and extend over at least an underside portion of those arms
and
a charging platform for at least the unmanned aerial vehicle, the charging platform being smaller than the UAV and comprising:
a horizontal frame, bounding an interior void, configured to support outwardly extending arms of a UAV that has landed on the charging platform;
a second plurality of contact charging pads for enabling charging of the UAV, wherein each of the second plurality of contact charging pads is positioned on the frame and extends over at least an upper portion of the charging frame.
