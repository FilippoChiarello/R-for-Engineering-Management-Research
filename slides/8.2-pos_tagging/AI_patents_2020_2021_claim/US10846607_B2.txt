Adaptive analytical behavioral and health assistant system and related method of use
</title>

<abstract>
An adaptive analytical behavioral health assistant may obtain blood pressure measurements from a user, execute a model of a physiological system generic to any user to generate notifications for the user, generate a modified model specific to a physiological system of the user based on the received blood pressure measurements, execute the modified model to generate personalized notifications, generate an updated modified model, at least once, based on the modified model and additional blood pressure measurements, and output the notifications including adjusting a timing of obtaining the blood pressure measurements, the personalized notifications, and the updated personalized notifications to the user.
