WIRELESS CARDIAC MONITORING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A cardiac monitoring system includes: a plurality of wireless electrode patches, each of the patches including a sensor to detect a characteristic of a subject, a wireless transmitter to transmit a signal of the detected characteristic, and a power module to supply electricity to one or more of the sensor and transmitter; and a wireless receiver to communicate with each of the wireless electrode patches to receive the signal indicative of the detected characteristic.

<claims>
1. A medical monitoring system comprising; a plurality of wireless electrode patches, each of the wireless electrode patches comprising a sensor configured to detect a medical characteristic of a subject, a wireless module configured to transmit a signal indicative of the detected medical characteristic, and a power module configured to supply electrical energy to one or more of the sensor and the wireless module, wherein the plurality of wireless electrode patches comprises fewer than 10 wireless electrode patches, and wherein each of the plurality of wireless electrode patches has a separate form factor that is spaced from the form factors of the other electrode patches; and a wireless receiver configured to communicate with each of the wireless electrode patches to receive at least the signal indicative of the detected medical characteristic and to generate an output based on the received signal.
2. The medical monitoring system of claim 1, wherein the detected medical characteristic comprises one or more electrical signals indicative of an activity of a heart of a user of the medical monitoring system.
3. The medical monitoring system of claim 1, wherein the output comprises a complete electrocardiogram trace.
4. The medical monitoring system of claim 1, wherein a placement of the plurality of wireless electrode patches is customized for a user of the medical monitoring system.
5. The medical monitoring system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of wireless electrode patches comprises six wireless electrode patches.
6. The medical monitoring system of claim 5, wherein each of the six wireless electrode patches includes: a location in a fourth intercostal space between rib 4 and rib 5 and immediately to the right of a sternum of the subject (V1); a location in the fourth intercostal space between rib 4 and rib 5 and immediately to the left of the sternum of the subject (V2); a location between V1 and V2 (V3), a location in a fifth intercostal space between ribs 5 and 6 in a mid-clavicular line (V4); a location horizontally even with V4 in a left anterior axillary line (V5); and a location horizontally even with V4 and V5 in a midaxillary line (V6).
7. The medical monitoring system of claim 1, wherein each of the plurality of wireless electrode patches comprises a thermoplastic substrate material.
8. The medical monitoring system of claim 7, wherein the thermoplastic substrate material is a flexible silicone material.
9. The medical monitoring system of claim 1, wherein each of the plurality of wireless electrode patches comprises a silver-silver chloride material.
10. A method of determining a medical characteristic of a user, the method comprising; determining a number of wireless electrode patches to be placed on the user, each of the wireless electrode patches comprising a sensor configured to detect a medical characteristic of a subject, a wireless module configured to transmit a signal indicative of the detected medical characteristic, and a power module configured to supply electrical energy to one or more of the sensor and the wireless module, wherein the number is less than 10; determining a placement position on the user of each of the wireless electrode patches, wherein the number of the wireless electrode patches and the placement position of each of the wireless electrode patches is configured to facilitate generation of a complete electrocardiogram trace using a minimal number of the wireless electrode patches; disposing the number of the wireless electrode patches at the determined placement positions on the user; receiving, wirelessly, one or more signals indicative of an activity of the heart of the user; causing generation of the complete electrocardiogram trace based on the received one or more signals.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein each of the wireless electrode patches has a separate form factor, and wherein the placement positions are configured such that the form factor of each of the wireless electrode patches is spaced from the form factors of the other electrode patches.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein determining a number of the wireless electrode patches is based on a learning mechanism.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the learning mechanism comprises heuristics, machine learning, or historical user medial data, or a combination thereof.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein determining a placement position on the user of the wireless electrode patches is based on a learning mechanism.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the learning mechanism comprises heuristics, machine learning, or historical user medial data, or a combination thereof.
16. The method of claim 10, wherein the number of wireless electrode patches is six.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein placement positions of the six wireless electrode patches include: a location in a fourth intercostal space between rib 4 and rib 5 and immediately to the right of a sternum of a subject (V1); a location in the fourth intercostal space between rib 4 and rib 5 and immediately to the left of the sternum of the subject (V2); a location between V1 and V2 (V3); a location in a fifth intercostal space between ribs 5 and 6 in a mid-clavicular line (V4); a location horizontally even with V4 in a left anterior axillary line (V5); and a location horizontally even with V4 and V5 in a midaxillary line (V6).
18. The method of claim 10, wherein each of the wireless electrode patches comprises a thermoplastic substrate material.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the thermoplastic substrate material is a flexible silicone material.
20. The method of claim 10, wherein each of the wireless electrode patches comprises a silver-silver chloride material.
