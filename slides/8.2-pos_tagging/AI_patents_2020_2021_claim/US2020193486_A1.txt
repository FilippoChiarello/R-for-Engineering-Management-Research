SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING BID VECTOR TRANSFORMED PREDICTIVE CLICK-THROUGH RATE
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods, and computer-readable media for pricing an auction for an advertisement campaign in and real-time bidding environment are provided. The method can include receiving a bid request having a plurality of features and feature value and extracting stored values from the feature matrix corresponding to the feature values, and determining a bid vector based on the stored values and an ideal click vector based on best values for the features stored in the feature matrix. The method can include determining a similarity measure between the bid vector and the ideal click vector and calculating a probability click through rate (pCTR) index based on the similarity measure. The pCTR index can be used for selecting whether to not bid, maintain the bid, or increase the bid on certain advertising.

<claims>
1. A method for pricing an auction for an advertisement campaign in and real-time bidding environment, the method comprising: receiving, at one or more processors, a bid request having a plurality of features and feature values related to the plurality of features; comparing, at one or more processors, the plurality of feature values to a feature matrix stored in a memory coupled to the one or more processors; extracting, at one or more processors, stored values from the feature matrix corresponding to the plurality of feature values; determining, at one or more processors, a bid vector based on the stored values; determining, at one or more processors, an ideal click vector based on best values for the plurality of features stored in the feature matrix, the best values having a highest click probability for a given feature within the feature matrix; determining, by the one or more processors, a similarity measure between the bid vector and the ideal click vector; calculating, by the one or more processors, a probability click through rate (pCTR) index based on the similarity measure, the pCTR index comprising a probability between zero and one; and selecting, at one or more processors, based on the pCTR index, to not bid, maintain the bid, or increase the bid.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein, the selecting to not bid is based on a first range of probability, the selecting to maintain the bid is based on a first range of probability different than the first range, and the selecting to increase the bid is based on a first range of probability different than the first range and the second range.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising performing a test on a control line; performing the test on a pCTR line; and measuring key performance indicators (KPIs) of the control line and the pCTR line based on the test of the control line and the pCTR line; selecting one of the control line and the pCTR line for use in a campaign based on the KPIs.
4. A system for pricing an auction for an advertisement campaign in and real-time bidding environment, the system comprising: a memory for storing a feature matrix having a plurality of features and feature values associated with each feature of the plurality of features; and one or more processors communicatively coupled with the memory and configured to receive a bid request having a plurality of features and feature values related to the plurality of features; compare the plurality of feature values to a feature matrix stored in the memory; extract values from the feature matrix stored in the memory corresponding to the plurality of feature values; determine a bid vector based on the stored values; determine an ideal click vector based on best values for the plurality of features stored in the feature matrix, the best values having a highest click probability for a given feature within the feature matrix; determine a similarity measure between the bid vector and the ideal click vector; calculate a probability click through rate (pCTR) index based on the similarity measure, the pCTR index comprising a probability between zero and one; and select whether to not bid, to maintain the bid, or to increase the bid, based on the pCTR index.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein, the selecting to not bid is based on a first range of probability, the selecting to maintain the bid is based on a first range of probability different than the first range, and the selecting to increase the bid is based on a first range of probability different than the first range and the second range.
6. The system of claim 4, wherein the one or more processors is further configured to: perform a test on a control line; and perform the test on a pCTR line; and measure key performance indicators (KPIs) of the control line and the pCTR line based on the test of the control line and the pCTR line; select one of the control line and the pCTR line for use in a campaign based on the KPIs.
