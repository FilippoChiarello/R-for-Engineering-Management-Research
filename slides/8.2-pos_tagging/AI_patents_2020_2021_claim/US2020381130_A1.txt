Systems and Methods for Machine Learning of Voice Attributes
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for machine learning of voice and other attributes are provided. The system receives input data, isolates predetermined sounds from isolated speech of a speaker of interest, summarizes the features to generate variables that describe the speaker, and generates a predictive model for detecting a desired feature of a person Also provided are systems and methods for detecting one or more attributes of a speaker based on analysis of audio samples or other types of digitally-stored information (e.g, videos, photos, etc.).
