NAVIGATION SYSTEM WITH AN ORDER OPTIMIZATION MECHANISM AND METHOD OF OPERATION THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
A method of operation of a navigation system including generating an estimated arrival time for a navigation route including a destination; calculating a preparation time for an order; determining an ordering time to place the order to the destination such that the estimated arrival time at the destination is approximately at an end of the preparation time; communicating the order at the ordering time; and generating a guidance for the navigation route to arrive at the destination at approximately at an end of the preparation time.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of operation of a navigation system comprising: generating an estimated arrival time for a navigation route including a destination; calculating a preparation time for an order; determining an ordering time to place the order to the destination such that the estimated arrival time at the destination is approximately at an end of the preparation time; communicating the order at the ordering time; and generating a guidance for the navigation route to arrive at the destination at approximately at an end of the preparation time.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein determining the ordering time includes determining a delay time to place the order.
3. The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein determining the ordering time includes determining a travel time of the navigation route greater than the preparation time.
4. The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein generating the guidance includes determining a recommended departure time.
5. The method as claimed in claim 1 further comprising: modifying the order with a further destination; and wherein: generating the guidance includes modifying the guidance to the further destination.
6. The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein generating the guidance includes generating the guidance to a waypoint fulfilling the order.
7. The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein generating the guidance includes determining a start delay when a travel time of the navigation route is less than the preparation time.
8. A navigation system comprising: a control unit configured to: generate an estimated arrival time for a navigation route including a destination; calculate a preparation time for an order; determine an ordering time to place the order to the destination such that the estimated arrival time at the destination is approximately at an end of the preparation time; generate a guidance for the navigation route to arrive at the destination at approximately at an end of the preparation time; and a communication unit, coupled to the control unit, configured to communicate the order at the ordering time.
9. The system as claimed in claim 8 wherein the control unit is further configured to determine a delay time to place the order.
10. The system as claimed in claim 8 wherein the control unit is further configured to determine a travel time of the navigation route greater than the preparation time
11. The system as claimed in claim 8 wherein the control unit is further configured to determine a recommended departure time.
12. The system as claimed in claim 8 wherein the control unit is further configured to: modify the order with a further destination; and modify the guidance to the further destination.
13. The system as claimed in claim 8 wherein the control unit is further configured to generate the guidance to a waypoint fulfilling the order.
14. The system as claimed in claim 8 wherein the control unit is further configured to determine a start delay when a travel time of the navigation route is less than the preparation time.
15. A non-transitory computer readable medium including instructions executable by the control unit for a navigation system comprising: generating an estimated arrival time for a navigation route including a destination; calculating a preparation time for an order; determining an ordering time to place the order to the destination such that the estimated arrival time at the destination is approximately at an end of the preparation time; communicating the order at the ordering time; and generating a guidance for the navigation route to arrive at the destination at approximately at an end of the preparation time.
16. The non-transitory computer readable medium as claimed in claim 15 wherein determining the ordering time includes determining a delay time to place the order.
17. The non-transitory computer readable medium as claimed in claim 15 wherein determining the ordering time includes determining a travel time of the navigation route greater than the preparation time.
18. The non-transitory computer readable medium as claimed in claim 15 wherein generating the guidance includes determining a recommended departure time.
19. The non-transitory computer readable medium as claimed in claim 15 further comprising: modifying the order with a further destination; and wherein: generating the guidance includes modifying the guidance to the further destination.
20. The non-transitory computer readable medium as claimed in claim 15 wherein generating the guidance includes generating the guidance to a waypoint fulfilling the order.
