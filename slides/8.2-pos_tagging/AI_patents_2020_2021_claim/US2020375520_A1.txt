IMPROVED METHOD FOR QUANTIFYING BALANCE
</title>

<claims>
1. A method for quantifying the balance of an individual to obtain a value representative of the balance of said individual, said method being implemented by a device comprising at least one data processing module connected to a storage means, said method comprising recording, on the storage means, at least one statokinesigram of the individual obtained from a platform comprising pressure and/or force sensors, said method further comprising the following steps: segmenting as a function of time, the statokinesigram of the individual recorded on the storage means, by the data processing module, so as to generate several statokinesigram portions, extracting, by the data processing module and from the statokinesigram portions, values of at least one trajectory parameter, determining, by the data processing module, values of at least two quantifiers, from the values of trajectory parameters extracted in the extraction step for each of the statokinesigram portions generated in the segmentation step, and determining, by the data processing module, said value representative of the balance of the individual from the values of the quantifiers of each of the statokinesigram portions.
2. The quantification method according to claim 1, wherein the statokinesigram portions have a duration of less than or equal to three seconds.
3. The quantification method according to claim 1, wherein the segmenting step generates, for each statokinesigram, at least ten statokinesigram portions.
4. The quantification method according to claim 1, wherein the statokinesigram portions generated in the segmenting step have, for consecutive portions, an overlap ratio of at least 25%, preferably at least 50%.
5. The quantification method according to claim 1, wherein the statokinesiogram portions generated in the segmenting step have, for consecutive portions, an overlap ratio of at most 95%.
6. The quantification method according to claim 1, wherein said step of determining said value representative of the balance of the individual is carried out by implementing the values of the quantifiers determined in the step of determining values of said at least two quantifiers in a scoring algorithm so as to, depending on the values of the quantifiers, assign a score to each of the statokinesiogram portions or classify each of the statokinesiogram portions by categories.
7. (canceled)
8. The quantification method according to claim 6, wherein the scoring algorithm is an unsupervised partitioning algorithm.
9. The quantification method according to claim 8, wherein the unsupervised partitioning algorithm is selected from an unsupervised Gaussian mixture model, a hierarchical bottom-up classification, or a hierarchical top-down classification.
10. The quantification method according to claim 1, further comprising a step of generating raw data corresponding to the displacement of the center of a pressure applied by the whole body of an individual over time on a platform.
11. The quantification method according to claim 10, further comprising a step of transforming the raw data into trajectory data of a center of pressure.
12. The quantification method according to claim 10, wherein the raw data corresponding to the displacement of a center of pressure of an individual is obtained in a Romberg test.
13. The quantification method according to claim 12, wherein the segmenting step is performed from a statokinesigram obtained while the individual has his/her eyes open and a statokinesigram obtained while the individual has his/her eyes closed, and wherein the method includes, for at least one quantifier, calculating an O/F or F/O ratio corresponding to the ratio between the value of a trajectory parameter calculated from a statokinesigram obtained while the individual has his/her eyes open and the value of a trajectory parameter calculated from a statokinesigram obtained while the individual has his/her eyes closed (O/F ratio) or the opposite (F/O ratio).
14. (canceled)
15. (canceled)
16. The quantification method according to claim 1, wherein the trajectory parameter is a position, stability, and/or dynamics trajectory parameter of a center of pressure.
