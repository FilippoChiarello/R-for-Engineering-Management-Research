<claims>
1. A system comprising: a sensor comprising a sensor processor and sensor memory, the second memory storing executable instructions that when executed by the sensor processor causes the sensor processor to perform the steps of: monitoring an asset over a network; receiving a request to access the asset from a second computer, wherein the request comprises a blockchain address of the second computer; generating a message comprising the second computer blockchain address, a location and blockchain address of the sensor processor and sensor memory and, transmitting the message to a first computer; the first computer comprising a first processor and first memory, the first memory storing executable instructions that when executed by the first processor causes the first processor to perform the steps of: storing a smart contract wherein the smart contract comprises a code and acceptance qualifications; evaluating the message by comparing the second processor blockchain address, the location and blockchain address of the sensor processor and sensor memory to the acceptance qualifications, and based on the evaluation, transmitting an authorization to the second computer, wherein the authorization comprises the code; the second computer comprising a second processor and second memory, the second memory storing executable instructions that when executed by the second processor causes the second processor to perform the steps of: receiving the authorization and accessing the asset using the code.
2. The device of claim 1, wherein the first or second memory stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor, causes the processor to perform the step of access the blockchain for a text or term of a unilateral contract requiring at least a partial performance of the text or term.
3. The device of claim 1, wherein the first or second memory stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor, causes the processor to access a side chain or a second blockchain.
4. The device of claim 1, wherein the first or second memory stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor, causes the processor to hedge the electronic contract with one or more of: equity, debts, derivatives, synthetics, notes, stocks, preferred shares, bonds, debentures, options, futures, swaps, rights, warrants, commodities, or currencies.
5. The device of claim 1, wherein the first or second memory stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor, causes the processor to receive from the second processor a manifestation of intent for a contract and assents to the contract.
6. The device of claim 1, wherein the first or second memory stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor accepts from the second processor an advertisement with a quantity and recipient, a production contract, an output contract, or a requirement contract.
7. The device of claim 1, wherein the first or second memory stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor revokes or cancels the contract upon receiving a revocation from an offeror.
8. The device of claim 1, wherein the first or second memory stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor checks for compliance with Uniform Commercial Code.
9. The device of claim 1, wherein the first or second memory stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor accepts or rejects a counter-offer if the other machine is not a software agent for a merchant.
10. The device of claim 1, wherein the first or second memory stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor causes the processor to assigns the contract to the second processor.
11. The device of claim 1, wherein the first or second memory stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor stores a unilateral contract with a second machine and requests payment from the second machine based on the unilateral contract.
12. The device of claim 1, wherein the first or second memory stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor processes an option to extend time to respond to a predetermined time.
13. The device of claim 12, wherein the first or second stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor, processes the option without payment if the other machine is a merchant agent and otherwise receives payment to bind the option.
14. The device of claim 1, wherein the first or second memory stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor, comprises data for a real estate transaction or a rental transaction.
15. The device of claim 1, wherein the first or second memory stores data for a sport event or fitness event.
16. The device of claim 1, wherein the first or second memory stores data for a health transaction or medical transaction.
17. The device of claim 1, wherein the first or second memory stores data for gaming transfer, gambling transfer, betting transfer, auction transfer, or money transfer.
18. A method, comprising: storing, by a first processor, a smart contract wherein the smart contract comprises a code and acceptance qualifications; monitoring, by a sensor, an asset over a network; receiving, by the sensor, a request to access the asset from a second processor, wherein the request comprises a blockchain address of the second processor; generating, by the sensor, a message comprising the second processor blockchain address, a location of the sensor, and a blockchain address of the sensor; transmitting, by the sensor, the message to the first processor; evaluating, by the first processor, the message by comparing the second processor blockchain address, the location of the sensor, and the sensor blockchain address to the acceptance qualifications; based on the evaluation, transmitting, by the first processor, an authorization to the second processor, wherein the authorization comprises the code; and, receiving, by the second processor, the authorization and accessing, by the second processor, the asset using the code.
