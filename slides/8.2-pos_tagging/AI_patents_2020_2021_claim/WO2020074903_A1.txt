METHODS, SYSTEMS AND APPARATUS FOR IMPROVED THERAPY DELIVERY AND MONITORING
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method is provided for taking one or more actions relating to therapy, the method comprising: obtaining data comprising audio data relating to a therapy session between a therapist and one or more patients; extracting text data from the audio data to form a transcript; dividing the transcript into a plurality of utterances; using at least a first part of a deep learning model to assign a semantic representation to each of the plurality of utterances to produce a plurality of assigned utterances; compiling the plurality of assigned utterances to form a representation of the therapy session; using at least a second part of a deep learning model, and an input comprising the representation of the therapy session, to obtain an output predicting a characteristic of the therapist, and/or the therapy, and/or the one or more patient; and causing the system to take one or more actions relating to the therapy, wherein the one or more actions are selected based on the output meeting one or more predetermined criterion.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for taking one or more actions relating to therapy, the method comprising:
obtaining data comprising audio data relating to a therapy session between a therapist and one or more patients;
extracting text data from the audio data to form a transcript;
dividing the transcript into a plurality of utterances;
using at least a first part of a deep learning model to assign a semantic representation to each of the plurality of utterances to produce a plurality of assigned utterances;
compiling the plurality of assigned utterances to form a representation of the therapy session; using at least a second part of a deep learning model, and an input comprising the representation of the therapy session, to obtain an output predicting a characteristic of the therapist, and/or the therapy, and/or the one or more patient; and
causing the system to take one or more actions relating to the therapy, wherein the one or more actions are selected based on the output meeting one or more predetermined criterion.
2. A method according to claim 1 , wherein the audio data is separated into two or more audio streams by speaker diarization, each audio stream relating to one of the therapist or the one or more patients.
3. A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein each of the plurality of utterances is ascribed to either the therapist or the one or more patient to produce a plurality of therapist utterances and a plurality of patient utterances.
4. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein obtaining the audio data comprises use of a microphone array.
5. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the data further comprises video and/or passive data from the therapy session.
6. A method according to any preceding claim wherein the assigned utterances comprise tagged utterances.
7. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the input further comprises non-content related session features and/or patient variables.
8. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the deep learning model comprises a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural network or a hierarchical bidirectional long short-term memory (HiBiLSTM) neural network.
9. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the output or outputs comprise: a likelihood of clinical improvement by the patient; and/or
a likelihood of clinical recovery by the patient; and/or
a likelihood of the patient having a particular mental health disorder; and/or
a likelihood of engagement by the patient; and/or
a measure of quality of therapy delivered by the therapist.
10. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the output or outputs are generated in realtime whilst the therapy session is ongoing.
11. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the one or more actions comprise:
initiating an automated therapist support process that comprises providing information to the therapist via the system; and/or
initiating an automated therapy quality assurance process that comprises alerting a supervisor, service or payer of the therapist to below-average quality therapy delivery by the therapist; and/or
initiating an automated therapy auditing process that comprises collecting a plurality of outputs of the method relating to one or more therapy sessions or one or more therapists; and/or initiating an automated output report to one or more of: the therapist, a supervisor of the therapist, a service to which the therapist belongs and the payer for the therapy; and/or
initiating an automated medical diagnosis process that comprises providing a prediction of the presence of a mental health disorder in the one or more patient; and/or
initiating an automated data collection process that comprises storing the audio data, the audio streams, the transcript, the utterances, the assigned utterances, and/or the representation.
12. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the one or more actions relating to the therapy are taken in real-time whilst the therapy session is ongoing.
13. A method according to claim 11 , wherein the audio data, and/or the audio streams, and/or the transcript are provided to one or more of: the patient, the therapist, the supervisor of the therapist, the service to which the therapist belongs and the payer for the therapy.
14. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the therapy comprises psychotherapy.
15. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the patient has a mental health disorder.
16. A method according to claim 15 where the mental health disorder is selected from depression or an anxiety disorder.
17. A computer program product comprising instructions which, when the program is executed by a processor, cause the processor to carry out the method according to any preceding claim.
18. A non-transitory computer-readable medium comprising instructions which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to carry out the method of any one of the preceding method claims.
19. A system for carrying out the method according to any one of the preceding method claims, the system comprising: a processor; a natural language processing unit; and a memory unit
20. A computer program according to claim 17, a non-transitory computer-readable medium according to claim 18, or a system according to claim 19, for use in the treatment of a mental health disorder.
21 . A method of treating a patient with a computer program product according to claim 17, a nontransitory computer-readable medium according to claim 18, or a data processing system according to claim 19, wherein the patient has a mental health disorder.
