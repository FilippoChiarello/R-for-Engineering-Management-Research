ENDOGENOUS RETROVIRUS TRANSCRIPTION AS A MARKER FOR PRIMATE NAIVE PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS
</title>

<abstract>
An in vitro method for identifying, isolating and/or enriching primate naive pluripotent stem cells, the method including analyzing transcription of a type 7 long terminal repeat (LTR7) nucleic acid sequence of a type H human endogenous retrovirus (HERVH) (LTR7/HERVH-associated transcription), and identifying, isolating and/or enriching primate naive pluripotent stem cells based on LTR7/HERVH-associated transcription, wherein LTR7/HERVH-associated transcription is a marker for primate naive pluripotent stem cells. An isolated in vitro population of primate naive pluripotent stem cells is obtained by the method, wherein in the cells LTR7/HERVH-associated transcription is elevated in comparison to control cells, wherein control cells are primed pluripotent stem cells or differentiated cells.

<claims>
1. An in vitro method for identifying, isolating and/or enriching primate naive pluripotent stem cells, the method comprising: analyzing transcription of a type 7 long terminal repeat (LTR7) nucleic acid sequence of a type H human endogenous retrovirus (HERVH) (LTR7/HERVH-associated transcription), and identifying, isolating and/or enriching primate naive pluripotent stem cells based on LTR7/HERVH-associated transcription, wherein LTR7/HERVH-associated transcription is a marker for primate naive pluripotent stem cells.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein naive pluripotent stem cells are identified, isolated and/or enriched in which LTR7/HERVH-associated transcription is elevated in comparison to control cells, wherein control cells are primed pluripotent stem cells or differentiated cells.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the analyzed type 7 long terminal repeat nucleic acid sequence of a type H human endogenous retrovirus (LTR7/HERVH nucleic acid sequence) comprises a LBP9 binding motif.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein the LTR7/HERVH nucleic acid sequence comprises a binding motif for one or more transcription factors selected from the group consisting of LBP9, OCT4, NANOG and KLF4.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein analyzing the LTR7/HERVH nucleic acid sequence comprises employing a nucleic acid reporter construct, said construct comprising a nucleic acid sequence region encoding one or more reporter molecules operably linked to a sequence comprising one or more LTR7/HERVH nucleic acid sequences.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the reporter molecule is a fluorescent protein.
7. The method according to claim 5, wherein the reporter molecule is an antibiotic resistance gene.
8. The method according to claim 5, wherein the method comprises analyzing expression of the reporter molecule encoded by said construct.
9. The method according to claim 1, wherein the cells are cultivated in a cell growth medium comprising at least: one or more inhibitors of mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) or extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK) (MEK/ERK inhibitors), one or more Axin stabilizers, one or more protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, and one or more histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.
10. The method according to claim 9, wherein the cell growth medium further comprises one or more glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitors.
11. The method according to claim 9, wherein the cell growth medium further comprises at least one or more cytokines of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family.
12. The method according to claim 9, wherein the cell growth medium further comprises one or more B-raf inhibitors.
13. The method according to claim 1, wherein the method further comprises maintaining and/or enriching the identified, isolated and/or enriched LTR7/HERVH-expressing primate naive pluripotent stem cells in a stem cell population, by subsequently cultivating the cells in a cell growth medium comprising at least: one or more inhibitors of mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) or extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK) (MEK/ERK inhibitors), one or more Axin stabilizers, one or more protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, and one or more histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and optionally one or more glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitors, one or more cytokines of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family and/or one or more B-raf inhibitors.
14. An isolated in vitro population of primate naive pluripotent stem cells obtained by the method of claim 1, wherein in said cells LTR7/HERVH-associated transcription is elevated in comparison to control cells, wherein control cells are primed pluripotent stem cells or differentiated cells.
