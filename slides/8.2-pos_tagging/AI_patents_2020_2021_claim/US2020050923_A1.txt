DETECTING VISUAL ARTIFACTS IN IMAGE SEQUENCES USING A NEURAL NETWORK MODEL
</title>

<abstract>
Motivated by the ability of humans to quickly and accurately detect visual artifacts in images, a neural network model is trained to identify and locate visual artifacts in a sequence of rendered images without comparing the sequence of rendered images against a ground truth reference. Examples of visual artifacts include aliasing, blurriness, mosaicking, and overexposure. The neural network model provides a useful fully-automated tool for evaluating the quality of images produced by rendering systems. The neural network model may be trained to evaluate the quality of images for video processing, encoding, and/or compression techniques. In an embodiment, the sequence includes at least four images corresponding to a video or animation.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method, comprising: receiving a sequence of rendered images; and processing the sequence of rendered images, by a neural network model, to produce at least one quality metric for the sequence of rendered images, each quality metric indicating presence or absence of a visual artifact in the sequence of rendered images.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: dividing a first rendered image of the sequence of rendered images into a number of regions including at least a first region and a second region.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, wherein each region in the number of regions corresponds with a single pixel, and wherein the at least one quality metric includes at least one bit for each region.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 3, wherein processing the first rendered image comprises processing the regions in parallel to produce the at least one quality metric.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: dividing each rendered image in the sequence of rendered images into a number of regions including at least a first region and a second region, wherein the processing comprises processing the first region of each rendered image by the neural network model to produce a first quality metric of the at least one quality metric for each rendered image.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 5, wherein the processing further comprises processing the second region of each rendered image to produce a second quality metric of the at least one quality metric for each rendered image.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 6, wherein the second region is processed by a second neural network model in parallel with the processing of the first region by the neural network model.
8. The computer-implemented method of claim 6, wherein the first quality metric indicates a first type of visual artifact is present in the first region of a first rendered image and the second quality metric indicates a second type of visual artifact is present in the second region of the first rendered image.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the neural network model detects when a first type of artifact is present in the sequence of rendered images and ignores the presence of a second type of artifact in the sequence of rendered images.
10. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the sequence of rendered images includes at least four rendered images.
11. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the quality metric indicates a severity of the visual artifact.
12. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the visual artifact includes an aliasing artifact.
13. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the visual artifact includes a data compression artifact.
14. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the visual artifact includes a de-noising artifact.
15. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the visual artifact includes an overexposure artifact.
16. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the neural network model is trained to detect a first type of visual artifact using a second sequence of rendered images for a scene including a first image that does not include the first type of visual artifact and a second image that does include at least one occurrence of the first type of visual artifact.
17. The computer-implemented method of claim 16, further comprising computing a first ground truth quality metric for the first image and a second ground truth quality metric for the second image.
18. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the at least one quality metric is computed using only the sequence of rendered images without using a reference image.
19. A system, comprising: a memory storing a sequence of rendered images; and a processor configured to execute instructions that implement at least a portion of a neural network model configured to: receive the sequence of rendered images; and process the sequence of rendered images to produce at least one quality metric for the sequence of rendered images, each quality metric indicating presence or absence of a visual artifact in the sequence of rendered images.
20. A non-transitory computer-readable media storing computer instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the steps of: receiving a sequence of rendered images; and processing the sequence of rendered images, by a neural network model, to produce at least one quality metric for the sequence of rendered images, each quality metric indicating presence or absence of a visual artifact in the sequence of rendered images.
