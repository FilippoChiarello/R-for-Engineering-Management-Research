DATA AGGREGATION BASED ON DISPARATE LOCAL PROCESSING OF REQUESTS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for data aggregated based on disparate local processing of requests. One of the methods includes receiving a request associated with analyzing medical data, the request specifying one or more constraints; accessing index information, and identifying one or more medical providers storing medical data responsive to the request; instructing, for each medical provider, compute systems controlled by the medical provider to perform the request; receiving, from the medical providers, results associated with the request, and aggregating the results; providing the aggregated results in response to the request.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer system comprising one or more computer processors configured to execute software code to perform operations comprising: receiving a request associated with analyzing medical data, the request specifying one or more constraints; accessing index information, and identifying one or more medical providers storing medical data responsive to the request; instructing, for each medical provider, compute systems controlled by the medical provider to perform the request; receiving, from the medical providers, results associated with the request, and aggregating the results; providing the aggregated results in response to the request.
2. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the index information indicates network locations associated with compute systems.
3. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the index information is generated by compute systems associated with the medical providers, and wherein the computer system receives the index information.
4. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the compute systems are configured to crawl electronic medical record systems.
5. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the request is received via application programming interfaces (APIs) associated with the computer system.
6. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the aggregated results indicate one or more insights extracted from medical data, and wherein the computer system does not have access to the medical data.
7. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the request indicates a model, and wherein each compute systems is configured to perform the request based on the model and medical data controlled by a medical provider associated with the compute system.
8. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the request indicates a machine learning model to be trained, and wherein the request includes information escribing the machine learning model.
9. The computer system of claim 8, wherein the information comprises hyperparameters associated with the machine learning model.
10. The computer system of claim 9, wherein instructing compute systems comprises: instructing first compute systems associated with a first medical provider, wherein the first compute systems train the machine learning model and generate learned parameters; receiving, from the first compute systems, the learned parameters; and instructing second compute systems associated with a second medical provider, wherein the instructions comprise the learned parameters, and wherein the second compute systems are configured to update the learned parameters.
11. The computer system of claim 1, further comprising determining a measure of complexity associated with the request, wherein the measure of complexity is associated with consideration to be provided to the identified medical providers.
12. The computer system of claim 11, wherein a measure of complexity is based on expected resource usage of a compute system to perform the request.
13. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the request comprises a query, and wherein the query specifies a specific analysis to be performed.
14. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the medical data responsive to the request is determined, based on data access rights, to be authorized for utilization in performance of the request.
15. A computer system comprising one or more computer processors configured to execute software code to perform operations comprising: obtaining a plurality of agreements, the agreements including indications of data access rights to portions of medical data; determining, based on the agreements, data access rights for a plurality of patients, the data access rights constraining access to portions of medical associated with the patients, and the data access rights requiring authorization of one or more entities generating, for at least one patient, a data access table representing a graphical depiction of data access rights of the at least one patient; and causing presentation of the data access table.
16. The computer system of claim 15, wherein the operations further comprise: causing presentation of summary information associated with data access tables generated for the plurality of patients.
17. The computer system of claim 15, wherein each portion of medical data is representative of a type of medical data.
18. The computer system of claim 17, wherein each type of medical data requires specific entities to authorize sharing the type of medical data.
19. The computer system of claim 17, wherein the types of medical data based on separations of medical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system.
20. The computer system of claim 15, wherein the operations further comprise: receiving, from an outside system, instructions to implement a request; identifying medical data responsive to the request and performing the request; and providing results to the outside system.
21. The computer system of claim 20, wherein the request indicates a model to be utilized and constraints associated with the medical data.
22. A computer system comprising one or more computer processors configured to execute software code to perform operations comprising: receiving a request for medical data from an outside entity; accessing a plurality of data access tables, each data access table being associated with a patient and indicating authorization to share specific portions of medical data of the patient with outside entities; determining that the outside entity is authorized to access the requested medical data based on the data access tables; and enabling access, by the outside entity, to the requested medical data.
23. The computer system of claim 22, wherein enabling access comprises routing the request to an electronic medical record (EMR) system, and routing, from the EMR system, the medical data to the outside entity.
