ITERATIVE BRANCHING STRUCTURE SEGMENTATION METHOD AND SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Some embodiments include a method, comprising: receiving an image (102) representing a branching structure; determining a starting feature (104) of the branching structure; selecting a subregion of the image based on the starting feature (108); segmenting the branching structure in the subregion (110); generating a set of next features based on the segmented branching structure; and for each of the next features (116), repeating the selecting of the subregion based on the next feature, the segmenting of the branching structure, and the generating of the set of next features.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: receiving an image representing a branching structure; determining a starting feature of the branching structure; selecting a subregion of the image based on the starting feature; segmenting the branching structure in the subregion; generating a set of next features based on the segmented branching structure; and for each of the next features, repeating the selecting of the subregion based on the next feature, the segmenting of the branching structure, and the generating of the set of next features.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
repeating the selecting of the subregion, the segmenting of the branching structure, and the generating of the set of next features until each next feature has been used to select a subregion, segment the branching structure in the subregion, and generate a set of next features based on the segmented branching structure.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising:
combining the segmented branching structure based on the starting feature and segmented branching structures based on each of the next features.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising:
combining the combined segmented branching structure with a prior combined segmented branching structure.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein: the image includes a discontinuity dividing the branching structure into a first branching structure and a second branching structure; the prior combined segmented branching structure was segmented from the first branching structure; and the starting feature is a feature of the second branching structure.
6. The method of any one of claims 1-5, wherein:
segmenting the branching structure in the subregion comprises segmenting the branching structure in the subregion based on a previously segmented branching structure in a previous subregion.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein:
the subregion overlaps the previous subregion.
8. The method of any one of claims 1-7, wherein:
segmenting the branching structure in the subregion comprises generating the segmented branching structure using a first convolutional neural network.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein:
the first convolutional neural network is a U-net architecture.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein:
generating the set of next features comprises generating the set of next features using a second convolutional neural network.
11. The method of any one of claims 1-10, further comprising:
analyzing the image representing the branching structure to determine the starting feature of the branching structure.
12. The method of any one of claims 1-10, wherein generating the set of next features comprises generating multiple features for the set of next features.
13. The method of any one of claims 1-12, wherein the branching structure is a vasculature of a living entity.
14. The method of any one of claims 1-13, wherein each subregion has a dimension of at least two image elements.
15. A system, comprising: a communication interface configured to receive an image representing a branching structure; and a processor configured to perform the method of any one of claims 1-14.
