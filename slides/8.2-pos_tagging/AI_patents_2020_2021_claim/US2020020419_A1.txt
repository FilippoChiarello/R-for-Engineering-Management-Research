</title>

<abstract>
A single-cell transition signature is accessed that represents differential cellular-component expression between a first and altered cell state. The altered state occurs through cellular transition from the first to altered cell state. The transition signature comprises an identification of a plurality of cellular-components and, for each such cellular-component, a corresponding first significance score quantifying an association between a change in expression of the respective cellular-component and a change in cell state between the first and altered cell state. The transition signature is compared to a perturbation signature representing differential cellular-component expression between unperturbed cells and perturbed cells exposed to the perturbation. The perturbation signature comprises, for each respective cellular-component, a corresponding second significance score quantifying an association between (i) a change in expression of the cellular-components between the unperturbed and perturbed cells and (ii) a change in cell state between the unperturbed and perturbed cells.
