<title>
EVALUATING THE SAFETY PERFORMANCE OF VEHICLES
</title>

<abstract>
Among other things, safety performance of vehicles is monitored or evaluated, or both. Sensor data is received from one or more sensors at a vehicle. One or more risk sources encountered by the vehicle during a period of operation of the vehicle are identified based on the sensor data. One or more safety events experienced by the vehicle during the period of operation are identified based on the sensor data. A risk of a safety event experienced by the vehicle during the period of operation is determined based on the one or more risk sources. A safety performance of the vehicle during the period of the vehicle during the period of operation of the vehicle is determined based on the one or more safety events and the risk.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: receiving sensor data from one or more sensors at a vehicle, the sensor data having been generated while the vehicle traveled a route; after the vehicle has traveled the route, analyzing the sensor data by machine, the analyzing comprising: by machine, identifying, based on the sensor data, one or more risk sources encountered by the vehicle while the vehicle traveled the route, the route being indicative of an amount of traffic of other vehicles encountered by the vehicle, the amount of traffic of other vehicles comprising one of the risk sources; by machine, identifying, based on the sensor data, one or more safety events that were experienced by the vehicle with respect to the risk sources as the vehicle traveled the route; by machine, determining a risk of a safety event that was experienced by the vehicle with respect to the vehicle having traveled the route; and by machine, determining, based on the one or more safety events and the risk, a safety performance of the vehicle with respect to the vehicle having traveled the route.
2. The method of claim 1, in which the risk is measured by a risk score.
3. (canceled)
4. (canceled)
5. The method of claim 1, in which the sensors are included in one or more telematics devices at the vehicle.
6. The method of claim 1, in which the one or more risk sources include environmental risk sources due to conditions or features of the environment in which the vehicle is operated.
7. The method of claim 6, in which the environmental risk sources include other vehicles in the environment.
8. The method of claim 6, comprising filtering, from the one or more risk sources, risk sources due to conduct of a driver of the vehicle.
9. The method of claim 1, in which the one or more safety events include a crash of the vehicle or near-crash of the vehicle, or both.
10. (canceled)
11. The method of claim 1, comprising calculating an aggregate risk as a sum of the risk of the safety events posed by the respective risk sources.
12. The method of claim 11, in which the sum of the risk comprises a weighted sum.
13. The method of claim 1, in which determining the safety performance of the vehicle comprises determining a sum of the one or more safety events relative to the risk.
14. The method of claim 13, in which the sum of the one or more safety events comprises a weighted sum in which each of the one or more safety events is weighted based on the severity of the safety event.
15. The method of claim 1, comprising: applying the risk to a distance traveled by the vehicle during the traveling of the route by the vehicle to produce a risk-normalized distance traveled by the vehicle; and determining, based on the one or more safety events and the risk-normalized distance traveled, the safety performance of the vehicle during the traveling of the route by the vehicle.
16. The method of claim 1, comprising normalizing the risk based on a standard level of risk experienced for a past period of operation of the vehicle.
17. The method of claim 1, in which the vehicle is a first vehicle, the method comprising: based on the sensor data from the one or more sensors at the first vehicle, determining a safety performance of a second vehicle in a same environment as the first vehicle during at least part of the traveling of the route by the first vehicle.
18. The method of claim 17, comprising determining the safety performance of the second vehicle based on identifying, from the sensor data from the one or more sensors of the first vehicle, one or more risk sources experienced by the second vehicle in the same environment as the first vehicle during at least part of the past period of operation of the first vehicle.
19. The method of claim 17, comprising identifying, based on the sensor data from the one or more sensors at the first vehicle, one or more safety events experienced by the second vehicle during at least part of the past period of operation of the first vehicle.
20. The method of claim 17, comprising determining, based on the one or more risks experienced by the second vehicle, a risk of a safety event experienced by the second vehicle during at least part of the past period of operation of the first vehicle.
21. The method of claim 17, comprising determining a relative safety performance of the first vehicle during at least part of the past period of operation of the first vehicle by comparing the safety performance of the first vehicle with the safety performance of the second vehicle.
22. The method of claim 1, comprising combining the risk for the vehicle with a risk of a safety event for one or more other vehicles having a same vehicle type as the vehicle; and determining a safety performance of the vehicle type based in part on the combined risk.
