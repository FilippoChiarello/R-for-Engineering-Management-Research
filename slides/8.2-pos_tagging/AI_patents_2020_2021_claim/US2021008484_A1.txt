</title>

<abstract>
A state estimation apparatus includes: a current information acquisition part that acquires information about a current at a power supply part of a refrigerating/freezing apparatus; a current information storage part that holds current information in a normal state of the refrigerating/freezing apparatus; an evaluation part that derives a degree of change based on the acquired current information and the current information in the normal state of the refrigerating/freezing apparatus; a filter cleaning determination part that estimates a clogging state of a filter of the refrigerating/freezing apparatus based on the degree of change to determine whether cleaning of the filter is necessary; and an output part that provides, for a determination result indicating that the cleaning of the filter is necessary, an output to that effect.

2. The state estimation apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor performs outlier detection on the acquired current information, and if it is determined that there is unknown data, the processor determines that the cleaning of the filter is necessary.
3. The state estimation apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor calculates a correlation value between the acquired current information and the current information in the normal state of the refrigerating/freezing apparatus, and if the correlation value is equal to or less than a predetermined threshold, the processor determines that the cleaning of the filter is necessary.
4. The state estimation apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor calculates a difference between the acquired current information and the current information in the normal state of the refrigerating/freezing apparatus, and based on a magnitude relationship between a statistical value of the difference and a predetermined threshold, the processor determines whether the cleaning of the filter is necessary.
5. The state estimation apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor calculates an average value of the acquired current information and, based on the average value of the acquired current information, derives the degree of change with regard to the current information in the normal state of the refrigerating/freezing apparatus.
6. A computer-based state estimation method comprising: acquiring information about a current at a power supply part of a refrigerating/freezing apparatus; deriving a degree of change based on the acquired current information and current information in a normal state of the refrigerating/freezing apparatus; and estimating a clogging state of a filter of the refrigerating/freezing apparatus based on the degree of change to determine whether cleaning of the filter of the refrigerating/freezing apparatus is necessary.
7. The computer-based state estimation method according to claim 6, comprising: performing outlier detection on the acquired current information; and determining that the cleaning of the filter is necessary, if unknown data is detected.
8. The computer-based state estimation method according to claim 6, comprising: calculating a correlation value between the acquired current information and the current information in the normal state of the refrigerating/freezing apparatus; determining that the cleaning of the filter is necessary, if the correlation value is equal to or less than a predetermined threshold.
