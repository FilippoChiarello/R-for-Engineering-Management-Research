System and method for detecting instances of missing data records in usage data records generated for wireless services
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method and system for detecting instances of missing data records in Usage Data Records (UDRs) generated for wireless services is disclosed. The system and method comprises recording a sequence of events related to transmission of data through at least one service element, transmitting the sequence of events as usage data records to a server for accounting and using an anomaly detection algorithm to detect instances of missing usage data records in the transmitted usage data records.
