<title>
Gunshot Detection System with Location Tracking
</title>

<abstract>
A gunshot detection system includes a control panel that receives event data from gunshot sensor units detecting gunshots and generates location information pertaining to a shooting event based on the event data. The control panel includes a display on which a graphical user interface (GUI) is rendered. The GUI displays maps of a building with icons overlaid on the maps based on the generated location information. In one example, the GUI displays a map with an icon representing the active shooter, the position of the icon with respect to the floorplan image corresponding to an area of the building. In another example, the GUI displays a map with icons representing different gunshot sensor units, the icons having different visual characteristics to indicate that the gunshot sensor units detected the gunshots and/or which of the gunshot sensor units was determined to be closest to the detected gunshots.

<claims>
1. A system for detecting gunshots within a premises, the system comprising: gunshot sensor units for detecting gunshots and generating event data based on the detected gunshots; and a control panel for receiving the event data and generating location information within the premises based on the event data, the control panel comprising a display for displaying maps of the premises and displaying on the maps graphical elements based on the location information.
2. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the location information generated by the control panel includes an inferred route of movement of an active shooter through the premises.
3. The system as claimed in claim 2, wherein the inferred route of movement of the active shooter indicates previous movement, current location and/or predicted future movement of the active shooter.
4. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the location information generated by the control panel is based on which of the gunshot sensor units detected the gunshots and/or stored location information for the gunshot sensor units that detected the gunshots.
5. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the location information generated by the control panel is based on time information included in the event data for the detected gunshots.
6. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the gunshot sensor units include occupancy sensors for detecting a presence of persons and generating occupancy information, and the location information generated by the control panel is based on the occupancy information.
7. The system as claimed in claim 1, the location information generated by the control panel includes inferred proximity of gunshot sensor units to the detected gunshots.
8. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the control panel displays the graphical elements with different visual characteristics and/or overlaid on the maps in different positions with respect to the maps based on the location information.
9. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the graphical elements represent the gunshot sensor units, persons within the premises and/or movement routes through the premises.
10. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the maps include images depicting floorplans of the premises.
11. A method for detecting gunshots within a premises, the method comprising: detecting gunshots and generating event data based on the detected gunshots; generating location information within the premises based on the event data; and displaying maps of the premises and displaying on the maps graphical elements based on the location information.
12. The method as claimed in claim 11, further comprising generating the location information based on inferring a route of movement of an active shooter through the premises.
13. The method as claimed in claim 12, wherein the inferred route of movement of the active shooter indicates previous movement, current location and/or predicted future movement of the active shooter.
14. The method as claimed in claim 11, further comprising generating the location information based on which gunshot sensor units detected the gunshots and/or based on stored location information for the gunshot sensor units that detected the gunshots.
15. The method as claimed in claim 11, further comprising generating the location information based on time information included in the event data for the detected gunshots.
16. The method as claimed in claim 11, further comprising generating the location information based on occupancy information generated via occupancy sensors for detecting a presence of persons.
17. The method as claimed in claim 11, further comprising generating the location information based on inferring proximity to the detected gunshots of gunshot sensor units detecting the gunshots.
18. The method as claimed in claim 11, further comprising displaying the graphical elements with different visual characteristics and/or overlaid on the maps in different positions with respect to the maps based on the location information.
19. The method as claimed in claim 11, wherein the graphical elements represent gunshot sensor units detecting the gunshots, persons within the premises and/or movement routes through the premises.
20. The method as claimed in claim 11, wherein the maps include images depicting floorplans of the premises.
21. A gunshot sensor unit for detecting gunshots, the gunshot sensor unit comprising: microphones for detecting acoustic anomalies; and an occupancy sensor for detecting a presence of individuals.
22. A method, comprising: detecting gunshots and generating event data based on the detected gunshots; generating location information within the premises based on the event data; and detecting a presence of individuals within the premises.
