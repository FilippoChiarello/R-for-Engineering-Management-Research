<title>
METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR USING MACHINE-LEARNING EXTRACTS AND SEMANTIC GRAPHS TO CREATE STRUCTURED DATA TO DRIVE SEARCH, RECOMMENDATION, AND DISCOVERY
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems for using a combination of semantic graphs and machine learning to automatically generate structured data, recognize important entities/keywords, and create weighted connections for more relevant search results and recommendations. For example, by inferring relevant entities, metadata results are richer and more meaningful, enabling faster decision-making for the consumer and stronger viewership for the content owner.

<claims>
1. A method of providing content recommendations by automatically
determining relevancies of entities in text strings, the method comprising:
receiving, by a user input interface, a text string;
identifying, by control circuitry, a pronoun in the text string;
resolving, by the control circuitry, the pronoun into a noun to create a resolved text string;
identifying, by the control circuitry, a noun chunk in the resolved text string;
processing, by the control circuitry, the noun chunk using a classifier based on a semantic graph featuring a plurality of nodes, wherein each of the plurality of nodes is scored based on a closeness centrality metric and a betweenness centrality metric, wherein the closeness centrality metric is a measure of a sum of a length of a shortest path between a respective node and each of the other nodes in the semantic graph, and wherein the betweenness centrality metric is a measure of centrality in the semantic graph of a respective node;
determining, by the control circuitry, an entity based on processing the noun chunk using the classifier; and
generating for display, on a display device, the entity in response to the received text string. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein determining an entity based on processing the noun chunk using the classifier, comprises:
scoring each entity;
ranking each entity based on its respective score; and
selecting the entity with the highest score. 3. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the classifier is a Decision Tree Classifier or a Random Forest Classifier.
4. The method of any of claims 1-3, wherein generating for display the entity in response to the received text string comprises generating for display the entity in a search, recommendation, or discovery feature.
5. The method of any of claims 1-4, wherein resolving the pronoun into the noun to create the resolved text string, comprises resolving the pronoun using coreference resolution.
6. The method of any of claims 1-5, wherein identifying the noun chunk in the resolved text string comprises identifying the noun chunk using part-of-speech tagging.
7. The method of any of claims 1-6, wherein the semantic graph is a knowledge base that represents semantic relations between concepts in a network.
8. A computer program comprising computer-readable instructions which, when executed by respective one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the methods as recited in any of the preceding claims.
9. A system of providing content recommendations by automatically determining relevancies of entities in text strings, the system comprising:
a user input interface configured to receive a text string; and
control circuitry configured to:
identify a pronoun in the text string;
resolve the pronoun into a noun to create a resolved text string; identify a noun chunk in the resolved text string;
process the noun chunk using a classifier based on a semantic graph featuring a plurality of nodes, wherein each of the plurality of nodes is scored based on a closeness centrality metric and a betweenness centrality metric, wherein the closeness centrality metric is a measure of a sum of a length of a shortest path between a respective node and each of the other nodes in the semantic graph, and wherein the betweenness centrality metric is a measure of centrality in the semantic graph of a respective node;
determine an entity based on processing the noun chunk using the classifier; and
generate for display, on a display device, the entity in response to the received text string.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the control circuitry is configured to determine an entity based on processing the noun chunk using the classifier by:
scoring each entity; ranking each entity based on its respective score; and
selecting the entity with the highest score.
11. The system of claim 9 or 10, wherein the classifier is a Decision Tree
Classifier or a Random Forest Classifier. 12. The system of any of claims 9-11, wherein the control circuitry is configured to generate for display the entity in response to the received text string by generating for display the entity in a search, recommendation, or discovery feature.
13. The system of any of claims 9-12, wherein the control circuitry is configured to resolve the pronoun into the noun to create the resolved text string by resolving the pronoun using coreference resolution.
14. The method of any of claims 9-13, wherein the control circuitry is configured to identify the noun chunk in the resolved text string by identifying the noun chunk using part-of-speech tagging.
15. The method of any of claims 9-14, wherein the semantic graph is a knowledge base that represents semantic relations between concepts in a network.
