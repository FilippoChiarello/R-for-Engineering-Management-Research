SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR OPTIMIZED DELIVERY BASED ON CUSTOMER LOCATION
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a method of delivering a product comprising receiving from a user device, an order, a preferred delivery location, and a user device location, assigning the order a preparation time, receiving an updated user device location at predetermined intervals, using the user device location and order preparation time, placing the order in a production queue to be prepared for delivery, determining if the user device is at the preferred delivery location, when the user device is at the preferred delivery location, delivering the order.
</abstract>

<claims>
1 . A method of providing an order to a customer comprising;
h) receiving an order from a user device;
i) determining the preferred delivery location;
j) assigning at least one preparation time to the order;
k) receiving a user device location;
L) using the user device location and order preparation time, determining if the order should be placed in a production queue to be prepared for delivery;
m) repeating steps d and e until the order is put in the production queue; then
n) determining if the user device is at the preferred delivery location; and
when the user device is at the preferred delivery location, providing the order.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein step e further comprises using the user device location and preferred delivery location to determine an estimated time to arrival and comparing the estimated time to arrival to the order preparation time to determine if the order should be placed in a production queue.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein the step of assigning the order at least one preparation time includes grouping the items into categories and assigning each category an order preparation time.
4. The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein the step of assigning at least one preparation time includes assigning a preparation time to each item in the order.
5. The method of any one of claims 2 to 4 wherein the estimated time to arrival is used to assign one of a number of predetermined geozones and depending on the geozone assigned, adjusting the frequency of receiving the user device location.
6. The method of any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein after the order is put in the production queue a pickup slot location is assigned.
7. The method of claim 6 wherein the pickup slot location is communicated to the user device.
8. The method of any one of claims 2 to 8 wherein isochrones and isoclines are used to determine the estimated time to arrival.
9. A system for sequencing a series of orders for production comprising:
an order tracker for receiving orders and corresponding user device locations; said order tracker having a first database for storing items from incoming orders and
corresponding user device locations, and a second database for storing the preparation times associated with each item available for order;
said order tracker further comprising a processing means to assign each item in each order the corresponding prep time and assign an estimated time to arrival to each order based on the associated user device location; said processing means configured to receive periodically updated user device locations and update said first database with a new estimated time to arrival; said processer further configured to use said preparation times and new estimated time to arrival to determine if an order should be prepared; once the order is to be prepared it is displayed on a screen at a service location.
