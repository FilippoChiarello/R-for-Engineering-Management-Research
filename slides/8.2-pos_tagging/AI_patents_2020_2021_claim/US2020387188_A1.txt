DATA GENERATION METHOD, COMPUTER-READABLE RECORDING MEDIUM, AND INFORMATION PROCESSING APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
A data generation method by a computer is disclosed. First waveform data including marking information at a first position on a waveform, and acquiring second waveform data are acquired. A transformation function is specified that transforms the first waveform data to reduce the difference between a first value of a time axis for a first characteristic point in the first waveform data and a second value of the time axis for a second characteristic point, in the second waveform data, corresponding to the first characteristic point. Third waveform data are generated, in which the marking information is applied at a second position corresponding to the first position in the first waveform data, the second position being determined by using the transformation function.
