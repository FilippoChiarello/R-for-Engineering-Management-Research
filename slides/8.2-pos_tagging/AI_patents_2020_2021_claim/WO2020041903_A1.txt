<title>
NANO/MICRO-GRID POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
An artificial intelligence based power distribution system using a controller that receives relevant power data from dynamic observer modules that monitor the various components of a Nano /micro power grid. The dynamic observer modules monitor the power parameters of various energy sources as well as power loads and the main power grid. Based on data from the modules, the controller uses an artificial intelligence based techniques to control and manage power flow within the Nano/micro grid to work towards optimal power flow and resource utilization.
