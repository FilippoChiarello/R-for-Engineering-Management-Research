PLATFORM, SYSTEM AND METHOD OF GENERATING, DISTRIBUTING, AND INTERACTING WITH LAYERED MEDIA
</title>

<abstract>
The present application describes platform containing a dynamic multilayered media structure which is generated by aggregation of media pieces into a plurality of media layers. The platform allows users to interact with media layers of the dynamic multilayered media structure independently of one another. The platform further provides for a dynamic, customized media channel lineup and a user account that allows individual media pieces within the dynamic multilayered media structure to play across separate devices that are linked to the account. The user account allows for inputs including real-time controls over the media, interaction, preferences, adding additional media content, editing media into a condensed form, and curation options with the dynamic multilayered media structure.

3. The computer-implemented system according to claim 1 wherein the platform (300) further comprises content producers (320), which are responsible for the curation of the at least one dynamic multilayered media structure (370) .
4. The computer-implemented system according to previous claims wherein the at least one dynamic multilayered media structure (370) further comprises a plurality of dynamic multilayered media structures which allow for users (310) and content producers (320) to provide iterations with additions of media elements (625) that are recorded into the data profile of the dynamic multilayered media structure (573) and allow for multiple linked variations that derive from the original created dynamic multilayered media structure (370) .
5. The computer-implemented system according to claim 1 wherein the platform (300) further comprises a plurality of channels (220), wherein each of the plurality of channels (220) comprises a plurality of dynamic multilayered media structures (370) .
6. The computer-implemented system according to claim 1 wherein the platform (300) further comprises brand sponsored content or ad integration (335) which is controlled by the decisioning marketplace (130) being further modified based on the user preferences, settings, and data (170) and processed by the programmatic decisioning engine (360) .
7. The computer-implemented system according to claim 1 wherein the platform (300) further comprises a technology administrator (340) and media serving algorithms (345), wherein the technology administrator (340) changes or imports external services via API (350), modifying the decisioning criteria and outcomes, modifying APIs that provide additional features such as blockchain integrations, additional analytics, algorithmic decisioning, third-party certifications or integrations with copyright filtering and other forms of compliance with community standards.
8. The computer-implemented system according to claim 1 wherein the audio overlay (510) comprises at least one audio recording file or audio stream overlaid on at least one of the audio mix layer (520) and the video mix layer (530) .
9. The computer-implemented system according to claim 1 wherein the audio mix layer (520) comprises a plurality of audio files or edited elements of audio files from different services, local or remote playlists of songs or audio files that can play on separate computing devices from the other media layers .
10. The computer-implemented system according to claim 1 wherein the video mix layer (530) comprises a compilation of a plurality of video files which comprise edited video clips (533) and video segments (534) from one or more original video sources (531) or a live streaming video broadcast .
11. The computer-implemented system according to claim 1 wherein the video overlay layer (540) comprises at least one of an image file and a video file overlaid on the video mix layer (530) which include text (subtitles), graphics, motion graphics, scalable vector graphics (SVGs), artistic diagrams, live video stream, a video file or other creative uses .
12. The computer-implemented system according to claim 1 wherein the data overlay layer (550) comprises a link overlaid on at least one of the audio mix layer (520) and the video mix layer (530), wherein the link provides access to the data mix layer (560), comprising access to visual or audio scan codes or connection to applications and devices to provide more information about the media content.
13. The computer-implemented system according to claim 1 wherein the data mix layer (560) comprises data on each of the plurality of media pieces (100) comprising aggregation of information about the media layers, providing information across the mobile web pages, applications, web pages, interactive options, meta data, play instructions, brand integration, and the like.
14.
