SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETECTING AND MONITORING LEVELS OF PAIN USING MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY (MRS)
</title>

<abstract>
One dimensional (1D) and two dimensional (2D) MR spectroscopy of the brain provides an objective test for pain and level of pain. There are two ways of evaluating the data. The first is conventional analysis of the 2D MRS. The second us the use of data mining methods such as testing for correlation between wavelet-based features and self-reported pain intensity, the MBDA method. Both found multiple spectral regions that were highly correlated with self-reported pain. Two of these spectral regions are consistent with changes to the recently assigned substrate α-L Fucose and the Fuc-α(1−2) glycans in the human brain. There are common features recorded compared with prior reports using the MBDA method to evaluate pain associated with spinal cord injury and low back pain. Accordingly, by detecting the levels of selected neurochemical markers in MR spectroscopy of an individual, one can determine the level of pain by comparing spectral data obtained with a reference database which correlates level of selected neurochemicals with levels of pain.

<claims>
1. A method for enabling detecting the level of pain experienced by an individual, comprising:
obtaining spectral data of the brain of an individual; and
comparing the spectral data obtained with reference data which correlates the level of at least one selected neurochemical marker with the level of pain and providing an objective measure to enable detection of the level of pain based on the comparison.
2. The method of claim 1 , where in the selected neurochemical marker is at least one of the substrate a-L-Fucose and fucosylated glycan denoted Fuc II, the higher level of which indicates a higher level of pain.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the selected neurochemical marker is at least one of the fucosylated glycan denoted Fuc I to Fuc VII, the lower levels of which indicate a higher level of pain.
4. The method of claim 1 , wherein the pain is of neuropathic or nociceptive or inflammatory in nature from at least one of chronic or acute from low back pain, pelvic pain, pain as a consequence of spinal injury, trauma injury, jaw or dental injury and sporting injury.
5. A system for enabling detecting the level of pain experienced by an individual, comprising:
a magnetic resonance spectrometer for obtaining spectral data of the brain of an individual; and
a comparator for comparing the spectral data obtained with reference data which correlates the level of at least one selected neurochemical marker with the level of pain and providing an objective measure to enable detection of the level of pain based on the comparison.
6. A system for detecting the response to therapy as deduced by the level of pain experienced by an individual, comprising: a magnetic resonance spectrometer for obtaining spectral data of the brain of an individual; and
a comparator for comparing the spectral data obtained with reference data which correlates the level of at least one selected neurochemical marker with the level of pain and providing an objective measure to enable detection of the level of pain based on the comparison.
7. The system of claim 5, wherein the selected neurochemical marker is at least one of the substrate a-L-Fucose I and fucosylated glycan denoted Fuc II, the higher levels of which indicate a higher level of pain.
8. The system of claim 5, wherein the selected neurochemical marker is at least one of fucosylated glycan denoted Fuc I to Fuc VII, the lower level of which indicates a higher level of pain.
9. The system of claim 5, wherein the pain is at least one of chronic or acute from low back pain, pelvic pain, pain as a consequence of spinal injury, trauma injury, jaw or dental injury and sporting injury.
