Managing mechanical stress in sports participants
</title>

<abstract>
A method of predicting the probability of injuries in ice hockey which consists of analysing data from accelerometers and gyroscopes on the torso of a player and assessing the work load of the muscles of the player as an indicator of the probability of injury. One aspect provides a method of predicting the probability of groin injuries in ice hockey which consists of analysing data from accelerometers and gyroscopes on the torso of a player and assessing groin load as an indicator of the probability of groin injury. A second aspect provides method of managing player availability by limiting injuries which consists of analysing data from accelerometers and gyroscopes on the torso of a player and identifying and counting the number of slap shots executed as a means of assessing the player load as an indicator of probability of injury.

<claims>
1. A system for managing athlete availability comprising: player worn data loggers including sensors, each player worn data logger being affixed to a respective player; and a computing device adapted to receive data from the sensors of each player worn data logger, said computing device being programmed to: analyse the data received from the player worn data loggers by identifying a plurality of data points in the received data, to identify and count for each athlete movements from the data received from each respective player worn data logger by calculating features using data points in sub-sections of the data, and using the calculated features to identify and count the athlete movements, and to measure a work load associated with such movements for each player from the data received from each respective player worn data logger, said computing device also being programmed to display the data as athlete movement metrics.
2. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the athlete movement metrics include a count of left and right leg strides, groin load, and high intensity strides.
3. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the computing device is programmed to derive work load of an individual over a period of time from the data received from each player worn data logger to assess a probability of injury to the individual.
4. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the computing device is programmed to derive groin load from the data from each player worn data logger and assess groin load as an indicator of a probability of groin injury for each player.
5. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the computing device is programmed to identify and count a number of slap shots executed by each player as a means of assessing the player work load as an indicator of probability of injury for each player.
6. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein each calculated feature is analyzed by a learning tree algorithm.
7. The system as claimed in claim 6, wherein the learning tree algorithm comprises a random forest model.
8. The system as claimed in claim 6, wherein the learning tree algorithm determines whether or not each second of received data represents linear skating.
9. A method for managing athlete availability, the method comprising: affixing player worn data loggers to a plurality of players, each player worn data logger comprising sensors and being affixed to a respective player; receiving, with a computing device, data from the sensors of each player worn logger; analyzing, with the computing device, the data received for each layer from each respective player worn data logger to identify and count athlete movements and to measure a player work load associated with said player movements, wherein: the data received is analyzed by identifying a plurality of data points in the received data, data points in sub-sections of the data are used to calculate features of the received data, and the calculated features are used to identify and count the athlete movements; and displaying, using the computing device, the data as athlete movement metrics.
10. The method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the athlete movement metrics include a count of left and right leg strides, groin load, and high intensity strides.
11. The method as claimed in claim 9, further comprising deriving from the data received from each player worn data logger, with the computing device, player work load of an individual player over a period of time to assess a probability of injury to the individual player.
12. The method as claimed in claim 9, further comprising deriving from the data received from each player worn data logger, with the computing device, groin load and assess groin load as an indicator of a probability of groin injury for each player.
13. The method as claimed in claim 9, further comprising identifying and counting, with the computing device using the data received from each player worn data logger, a number of slap shots executed by each player as a means of assessing the player work load as an indicator of probability of injury for each player.
14. The method as claimed in claim 9, wherein each calculated feature is analyzed by a learning tree algorithm.
15. The method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the learning tree algorithm comprises a random forest model.
16. The method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the learning tree algorithm determines whether or not each second of received data represents linear skating.
