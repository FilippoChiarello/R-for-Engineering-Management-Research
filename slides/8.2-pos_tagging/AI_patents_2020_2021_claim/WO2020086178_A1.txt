SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR USING AN APPLICATION CONTROL PRIORITIZATION INDEX
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for using an application control prioritization index are disclosed. In one embodiment, in an information processing apparatus comprising at least one computer processor, a method for using an application control prioritization index may include the following: (1) receiving application data for a plurality of computer applications in a computer application portfolio; (2) receiving control data defining a plurality of application vulnerabilities; (3) determining a potential application vulnerability for each computer application based on the control data; (4) receiving a plurality of application attributes for each computer application; (5) determining an impact severity for the application vulnerability based on the application attributes; (6) generating an application control prioritization index score for each computer application based on the potential application vulnerability and the impact severity for the application vulnerability; and (7) generating an application portfolio view for the computer application portfolio based on the application control prioritization index scores.
</abstract>

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method for using an application control prioritization index, comprising:
in an information processing apparatus comprising at least one computer processor:
receiving application data for a plurality of computer applications in a computer application portfolio;
receiving control data defining a plurality of application vulnerabilities;
determining a potential application vulnerability for each computer application based on the control data;
receiving a plurality of application attributes for each computer application;
determining an impact severity for the application vulnerability based on the application attributes;
generating an application control prioritization index score for each computer application based on the potential application vulnerability and the impact severity for the application vulnerability; and
generating an application portfolio view for the computer application portfolio based on the application control prioritization index scores.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the application data comprises application assessments, application scans, application code scans, and application controls.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein each element of the control data is associated with a control weighting.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the weighting is based on machine learning.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the application attributes comprises a facing of the computer application and an availability requirement for the computer application.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the application attributes comprises a money movement requirement and an access to highly confidential data requirement.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the impact severity for each vulnerability is determined based on the application attributes.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
specifying a prioritization for application remediation based on the application control prioritization index score.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein each computer application attribute is associated with an application attribute weighting.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the application attribute weighting is based on machine learning.
11. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
identifying one of the computer applications for replacement or retirement based on the application control prioritization index score.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the application portfolio view identifies a number of computer applications in each of a plurality of application control priority index tiers.
13. A system for using an application control prioritization index, comprising:
a plurality of computer applications within a computer network, the plurality of computer applications part of a computer application portfolio; a plurality of data sources storing application data for the plurality of computer applications within a computer network;
an electronic device comprising at least one computer processor executing a computer program that performs the following:
receive application data for the plurality of computer applications in a computer application portfolio;
receive control data defining a plurality of application vulnerabilities;
determine a potential application vulnerability for each computer application based on the control data;
receive a plurality of application attributes for each computer application;
determine an impact severity for the application vulnerability based on the application attributes;
generate an application control prioritization index score for each computer application based on the potential application vulnerability and the impact severity for the application vulnerability; and
generate an application portfolio view for the application portfolio based on the application control prioritization index scores.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the application data comprises application assessments, application scans, application code scans, and application controls.
15. The system of claim 13, wherein each element of the control data is associated with a control weighting.
16. The system of claim 13, wherein the application attributes comprises a facing of the application, an availability requirement for the computer application, a money movement requirement, and an access to highly confidential data requirement.
17. The system of claim 13, wherein the impact severity for each vulnerability is determined based on the application attributes.
18. The system of claim 13, wherein the computer program further specifies a prioritization for application remediation based on the application control prioritization index score.
19. The system of claim 13, wherein the computer program further identifies one of the applications for replacement or retirement based on the application control prioritization index score.
20. The system of claim 13, wherein the application portfolio view identifies a number of applications in each of a plurality of application control priority index tiers.
