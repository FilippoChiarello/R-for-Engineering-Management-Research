CREATING AN IRIS IDENTIFIER TO REDUCE SEARCH SPACE OF A BIOMETRIC SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
The technology described in this document can be embodied in a method for generating an iris identifier. The method includes obtaining a plurality of images of an iris, and generating a binary code for each of the plurality of images of the iris, the binary code including a sequence of bits. The method also includes identifying a first pattern of bits for which bit values and bit-locations are the same across a plurality of the binary codes, generating a first index based on the first pattern of bits, and then storing the first index on a storage device in accordance with a database management system. The first index is linked to biometric information of a different modality for a corresponding user.

generating a first index based on the first pattern of bits; and storing the first index on a storage device in accordance with a database management system, the first index linked to biometric information of a different modality for a corresponding user.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein obtaining the plurality of images of the iris comprises:
capturing a first image of the iris; and
generating the plurality of images by processing the first image by multiple different filters that simulate various image capture conditions.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the binary code comprises filtering the image using a Gabor filter.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the index comprises combining the first pattern of bits together with location information corresponding to the pattern of bits.
