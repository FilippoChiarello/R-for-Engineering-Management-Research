<abstract>
A feature model, which calculates a feature value of an input image, is trained on a plurality of first images. First feature values corresponding one-to-one with the first images are calculated using the feature model, and feature distribution information representing a relationship between a plurality of classes and the first feature values is generated. When a detection model which determines, in an input image, each region with an object and a class to which the object belongs is trained on a plurality of second images, second feature values corresponding to regions determined within the second images by the detection model are calculated using the feature model, an evaluation value, which indicates class determination accuracy of the detection model, is modified using the feature distribution information and the second feature values, and the detection model is updated based on the modified evaluation value.
