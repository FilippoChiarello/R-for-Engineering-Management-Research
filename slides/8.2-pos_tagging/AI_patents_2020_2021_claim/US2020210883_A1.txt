<title>
ACCELERATION OF MACHINE LEARNING FUNCTIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A multi-staged sample and seed machine-learning training technique is presented. A sample proportion of a training data set is fed to a machine-learning algorithm (MLA) for purposes of configuring functions of the MLA to predict an output with a desired degree of accuracy. When iterating the sample proportion, if a deviation in an incrementally produced current accuracy of the MLA does not exceed a threshold, the sampled proportion is increased. This continues until the current degree of accuracy meets or exceeds the desired degree of accuracy, which is an indication that the functions of the MLA are configured as a desired model for producing the predicted output when the MLA is presented with input that may or may not have been associated with the training data set.
