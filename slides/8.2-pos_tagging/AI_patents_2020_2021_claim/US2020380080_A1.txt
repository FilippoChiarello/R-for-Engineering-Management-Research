METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATICALLY ORDERING AND FULFILLING ARCHITECTURE, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PRODUCT SAMPLE REQUESTS
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for automatically ordering and fulfilling architecture, design or construction product sample requests. Product sample request codes are added to 3D modeling programs, product pages, digital copies of standards books, product catalogs or product sheets. The product sample codes are used with artificial intelligence (AI) methods to automatically order and fulfill requests for architecture, design or construction product samples. The requested architecture, design or construction product samples are collected and shipped in a shipping container that includes graphical and other information that visually and consistently indicates the shipping container includes requested architecture, design or construction product samples. The shipping containers for the requested architecture, design or construction product samples may also include product branding for the manufactures or product suppliers of the requested architecture, design or construction product samples.
