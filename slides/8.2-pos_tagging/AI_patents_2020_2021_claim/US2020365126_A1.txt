INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An information processing device 11 including: a control data generation unit that inputs analysis data X that is to be processed, to a trained model that has learnt a relationship between analysis data X that represents a time series of musical notes, and control data Y for controlling movements of an object that represents a performer, thereby generating control data Y according to the analysis data X.

<claims>
1. An information processing method comprising: acquiring analysis data representing a time series of musical notes included in an analysis period; and generating control data, by inputting the acquired analysis data to a trained model that has learnt a relationship between the acquired analysis data and the control data, for controlling movements of a virtual object representing a performer.
2. The information processing method according to claim 1, wherein: the analysis period includes: a predetermined time; a first period that is precedent to the predetermined time; and a second period that is subsequent to the predetermined time, and the analysis data includes: a first time series of musical notes included in the first period; and a second time series of musical notes included in the second period, which are predicted from the first time series of the musical notes.
3. The information processing method according to claim 1, wherein the trained model includes: a convolutional neural network to which the analysis data is input and that generates a feature vector representing a feature of the analysis data; and a recurrent neural network that generates the control data according to the feature vector.
4. The information processing method according to claim 3, wherein the recurrent neural network includes at least one long short-term memory.
5. The information processing method according to claim 1, wherein the control data includes normalized coordinates indicating respective positions of a plurality of control points that define the virtual object.
6. An information processing device comprising: a memory storing instructions; and a processor that implements the instructions to execute a plurality of tasks, including: an acquiring task that acquires analysis data representing a time series of musical notes included in an analysis period; and a control data generating task that generates control data, by inputting the acquired analysis data to a trained model that has learnt a relationship between the acquired analysis data and the control data, for controlling movements of a virtual object representing a performer.
7. The information processing device according to claim 6, wherein: the analysis period includes: a predetermined time; a first period that is precedent to the predetermined time; and a second period that is subsequent to the predetermined time, and the analysis data includes: a first time series of musical notes included in the first period; and a second time series of musical notes included in the second period, which are predicted from the first time series of the musical notes.
8. The information processing device according to claim 6, wherein the trained model includes: a convolutional neural network to which the analysis data is input and that generates a feature vector that represents a feature of the analysis data; and a recurrent neural network that generates the control data according to the feature vector.
9. The information processing device according to claim 8, wherein the recurrent neural network includes at least one long short-term memory.
10. The information processing device according to claim 6, wherein the control data includes normalized coordinates indicating respective positions of a plurality of control points that define the virtual object.
11. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing a program executable by a computer to execute a method comprising: acquiring analysis data representing a time series of musical notes; and generating control data, by inputting the acquired analysis data to a trained model that has learnt a relationship between the acquired analysis data and the control data, for controlling movements of a virtual object representing a performer.
