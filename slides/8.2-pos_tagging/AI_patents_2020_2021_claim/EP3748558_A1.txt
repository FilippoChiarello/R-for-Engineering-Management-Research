AUTOMATED TELEPHONE CALL INITIATING SYSTEM AND METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, relating to synthetic call initiations and bailouts. In some implementations, a method includes analyzing, by a call initiating system, a real-time conversation between a first human and the bot during a phone call between the first human on a first end of the phone call and the bot on a second end of the phone call. The call initiating system can determine, based on the analysis of the real-time conversation, whether the phone call should be transitioned from the bot to a second human on the second end of the phone call. In response to determining that the phone call should be transitioned to a second human on the second end of the phone call, the call initiating system transitions the phone call from the bot to the second human

1. A method, comprising: receiving, by an automated telephone call triggering module of an automated telephone call initiating system that is configured to initiate telephone calls and conduct telephone conversations between a bot of the automated telephone call initiating system and a human representative of an entity, data indicating a first event; determining, by the automated telephone call triggering module and using the data indicating the first event, that the first event is a specific trigger event (i) that is a detection of an inconsistency of a value of a field associated with a first data source and a corresponding value of the field associated with a second data source and (ii) that triggers a workflow for the automated telephone call initiating system that begins with initiating a telephone call; selecting, based on the specific trigger event, a particular workflow from multiple possible workflows, the particular workflow corresponding to the specific trigger event; in response selecting the particular workflow, executing the particular workflow by (i) automatically initiating, by the automated telephone call initiating system, a telephone call to an entity specified by the particular workflow and (ii) determining a correct value of the field by conducting a telephone conversation between the bot of the automated telephone call initiating system and a human representative of the entity specified by the particular workflow; and storing in a data source only the correct value of the field determined from the telephone conversation between the bot of the automated telephone call initiating system and a human representative of the entity and not storing incorrect values from one or both of the first and second data sources.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the data indicating the first event is provided by a user.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the specific trigger event includes a user request.
4. The method of claim 1 comprising: receiving the value of the field associated with the first data source; receiving the value of the field associated with the second data source; determining that there is an inconsistency between the received values; responsive to determining that there is an inconsistency between the received values, providing the data indicating the first event to the triggering module.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the first data source is one of a knowledge base and a website and wherein the second data source is one of a social media profile and input received from a user.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the received values represent opening hours of a business location of the entity and the second data source is an input received from a user, and wherein the method comprises: detecting that the user is at the business location of the entity; determining, based on a time at which the user is detected to be at the business location of the entity, that the value associated with the first data source may be incorrect; prompting the user to provide information indicative of the value associated with the second data source.
7. An automated telephone call initiating system that is configured to initiate telephone calls and conduct telephone conversations between a bot of the automated telephone call initiating system and a human representative of an entity, comprising one or more processors operable to execute computer readable code which, when executed by the one or more processors, causes performance of: receiving data indicating a first event; determining, by an automated call triggering module and using the data indicating the first event, that the first event is a specific trigger event (i) that is a detection of an inconsistency of a value of a field associated with a first data source and a corresponding value of the field associated with a second data source and (ii) that triggers a workflow for the automated telephone call initiating system that begins with initiating a telephone call; selecting, based on the specific trigger event, a particular workflow from multiple possible workflows, the particular workflow corresponding to the specific trigger event; in response to selecting the particular workflow, executing the particular workflow by (i) automatically initiating, by the automated telephone call initiating system, a telephone call to an entity specified by the particular workflow and (ii) determining a correct value of the field by conducting a telephone conversation between the bot of the automated telephone call initiating system and a human representative of the entity specified by the particular workflow; and storing in a data source only the correct value of the field determined from the telephone conversation between the bot of the automated telephone call initiating system and a human representative of the entity and not storing incorrect values from one or both of the first and second data sources.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the data indicating the first event is provided by a user.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein the specific trigger event includes a user request.
10. The system of claim 7, wherein the computer readable code, when executed by the one or more processors, causes performance of: receiving the value of the field associated with the first data source; receiving the value of the field associated with the second data source; determining that there is an inconsistency between the received values; and responsive to determining that there is an inconsistency between the received values, providing the data indicating the first event to the triggering module.
11. The system of claim 7, wherein the first data source is one of a knowledge base and a website and wherein the second data source is one of a social media profile and input received from a user.
12. The system of claim 7, wherein the received values represent opening hours of a business location of the entity and the second data source is an input received from a user, and wherein the computer readable code, when executed by the one or more processors, causes performance of: detecting that the user is at the business location of the entity; determining, based on a time at which the user is detected to be at the business location of the entity, that the value associated with the first data source may be incorrect; and prompting the user to provide information indicative of the value associated with the second data source.
13. At least one non-transitory computer-readable storage medium encoded with executable instructions that, when executed by at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to perform operations comprising: receiving, by an automated telephone call triggering module of an automated telephone call initiating system that is configured to initiate telephone calls and conduct telephone conversations between a bot of the automated telephone call initiating system and a human representative of an entity, data indicating a first event; determining, by the automated telephone call triggering module and using the data indicating the first event, that the first event is a specific trigger event (i) that is a detection of an inconsistency of a value of a field associated with a first data source and a corresponding value of the field associated with a second data source and (ii) that triggers a workflow for the automated telephone call initiating system that begins with initiating a telephone call; selecting, based on the specific trigger event, a particular workflow from multiple possible workflows, the particular workflow corresponding to the specific trigger event; in response to selecting the particular workflow, executing the particular workflow by (i) automatically initiating, by the automated telephone call initiating system, a telephone call to an entity specified by the particular workflow and (ii) determining a correct value of the field by conducting a telephone conversation between the bot of the automated telephone call initiating system and a human representative of the entity specified by the particular workflow; and storing in a data source only the correct value of the field determined from the telephone conversation between the bot of the automated telephone call initiating system and a human representative of the entity and not storing incorrect values from one or both of the first and second data sources.
