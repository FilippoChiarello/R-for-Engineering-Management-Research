<title>
Medical Analyzer Using Mixed Model Inversions
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided for medical diagnosis and analysis using mixed model inversions. For example, a medical analyzer using mixed model inversions according to an embodiment of the present disclosure can be used to diagnose traumatic brain injury (TBI), which allows for isotropic and anisotropic inversions to be performed, enabling more accurate information about brain stiffness to be obtained.
