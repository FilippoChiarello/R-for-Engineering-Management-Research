SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ADJUSTING A FACILITY CONFIGURATION BASED ON A SET OF PARAMETERS FROM A DIGITAL TWIN
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for adjusting a facility configuration based on a set of parameters from a digital twin are disclosed. An example system may include an energy and compute facility having a compute task or resource, and an energy source utilization requirement. The system may include a controller having a facility model circuit to operate a digital twin for the facility, a facility description circuit to interpret a set of parameters from the digital twin, and a facility configuration circuit to operate an adaptive learning system. The adaptive learning system is configured to adjust a facility configuration based on the set of parameters from the digital twin and perform a purchase or sale transaction on an energy credit spot market or an energy credit forward market.
