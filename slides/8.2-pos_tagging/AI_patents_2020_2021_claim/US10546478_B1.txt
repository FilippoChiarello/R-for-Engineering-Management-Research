<title>
Sensor data to identify catastrophe areas
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method for generating an automated response to a catastrophic event, that includes (1) analyzing a sample set of data generated in association with a catastrophic event to determine a threshold pattern; (2) receiving, with customer permission or affirmative consent, home sensor data from a smart home controller via wireless communication or data transmission, the home sensor data including data regarding at least one of (i) structural status; (ii) wind speed; (iii) availability of electricity; (iv) presence of water; (v) temperature; (vi) pressure; and/or (vii) presence of pollutants in the air and/or water; (3) determining, based upon or from computer analysis of the home sensor data, whether the home sensor data indicates a match to the threshold pattern; and (4) automatically generating a response if the home sensor data indicates a match to the threshold pattern. As a result, catastrophic events and responses thereto may be improved through usage of a remote network of home sensors.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A computer-implemented method of generating an automated response to a catastrophic event, the method comprising: analyzing, via one or more processors, a sample set of data generated in association with a catastrophic event to determine a threshold pattern, the catastrophic event corresponding to an event type of a plurality of event types, and the threshold pattern being associated with the event type; receiving, via one or more processors, home sensor data from a smart home controller via wireless communication or data transmission, the home sensor data including data regarding at least one of (i) structural status; (ii) wind speed; (iii) availability of electricity; (iv) presence of water; (v) temperature; (vi) pressure; or (vii) presence of pollutants in air or water; determining, via the one or more processors, based upon or from computer analysis of the home sensor data, whether the home sensor data indicates a match to the threshold pattern associated with the catastrophic event; and automatically generating, via the one or more processors, a response if the home sensor data indicates a match to the threshold pattern associated with the catastrophic event, the response resulting in prioritizing gathering at least one type of data from the smart home controller over other types of data based on the event type.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, the method further comprising issuing, via the one or more processors, operational instructions to the smart home controller to reconfigure for collection of additional home sensor data.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein generation of the response is further conditioned on confirming the occurrence of the catastrophic event by analyzing, via the one or more processors, a supplemental data set, the supplemental data set including weather related data received from an external database configured for weather tracking.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the response includes an indication that human personnel should be deployed to an area near the home.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the response includes a list of person(s) residing in the area associated with the event data.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 5, further comprising comparing a set of insurance claims with the list of person(s).
7. A computer system for generating an automated response to a catastrophic event, the computer system comprising one or more processors and transceivers configured to: analyze a sample set of data generated in association with a catastrophic event to determine a threshold pattern, the catastrophic event corresponding to an event type of a plurality of event types, and the threshold pattern being associated with the event type; receive home sensor data from a smart home controller via wireless communication or data transmission, the home sensor data including data regarding at least one of (i) structural status; (ii) wind speed; (iii) availability of electricity; (iv) presence of water; (v) temperature; (vi) pressure; or (vii) presence of pollutants in air or water; determine based upon or from computer analysis of the home sensor data, whether the home sensor data indicates a match to the threshold pattern associated with the catastrophic event; and automatically generate a response if the home sensor data indicates a match to the threshold pattern associated with the catastrophic event, the response resulting in prioritizing gathering at least one type of data from the smart home controller over other types of data based on the event type.
8. The computer system of claim 7, wherein the one or more processors and transceivers are further configured to issue operational instructions to the smart home controller to reconfigure for collection of additional home sensor data.
9. The computer system of claim 7, wherein the one or more processors and transceivers are further configured to confirm the occurrence of the catastrophic event by analyzing a supplemental data set, the supplemental data set including weather-related data received from an external database configured for weather tracking.
10. The computer system of claim 7, wherein the one or more processors and transceivers are further configured to issue the response to include an indication that human personnel should be deployed to an area near the home.
11. The computer system of claim 7, wherein the one or more processors and transceivers are further configured to issue the response to include a list of persons residing in the area associated with the event data.
12. The computer system of claim 7, wherein the one or more processors and transceivers are further configured to compare a set of insurance claims with the list of persons.
