SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DETERMINING GENOME PLOIDY
</title>

<abstract>
A method for detecting ploidy in an embryo is provided, comprising receiving an embryo sequence data; aligning the received sequence data to a reference genome; identifying a region of interest in the aligned embryo sequence data; identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SMPs) in the sequence data by comparing the received sequence data to the aligned reference genome; determining a ploidy score comprising counting the number of observed SNPs in the region of interest; comparing the ploidy score to a predetermined threshold; and identifying the embryo as polyploid if the ploidy score is below the predetermined threshold.

<claims>
1. A method for detecting ploidy in an embryo, comprising: receiving an embryo sequence data; aligning the received sequence data to a reference genome; identifying a region of interest in the aligned embryo sequence data; identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SMPs) in the sequence data by comparing the received sequence data to the aligned reference genome; determining a ploidy score comprising counting the number of observed SNPs in the region of interest; comparing the ploidy score to a predetermined threshold; and identifying the embryo as polyploid if the ploidy score is below the predetermined threshold.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising identifying the embryo as euploid if the ploidy score is above the predetermined threshold.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the polyploid is a balanced polyploid.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the embryo sequence data is acquired by low-coverage sequencing.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the low-coverage sequencing is between about 0.001 and 10×.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein the low-coverage sequencing is between about 0.01 and 0.5×.
7. The method of claim 4, wherein the low-coverage sequencing is between about 0.25 and 0.2×.

12. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing computer instructions for detecting ploidy in an embryo, comprising: receiving an embryo sequence data; aligning the received sequence data to a reference genome; identifying a region of interest in the aligned embryo sequence data; identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SMPs) in the sequence data by comparing the received sequence data to the aligned reference genome; determining a ploidy score comprising counting the number of observed SNPs in the region of interest; comparing the ploidy score to a predetermined threshold; and identifying the embryo as polyploid if the ploidy score is below the predetermined threshold.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising identifying the embryo as euploid if the ploidy score is above the predetermined threshold.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the polyploid is a balanced polyploid.
15. The method of claim 12, wherein the embryo sequence data is acquired by low-coverage sequencing.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the low-coverage sequencing is between about 0.001 and 10×.
17. The method of claim 15, wherein the low-coverage sequencing is between about 0.01 and 0.5×.
18. The method of claim 15, wherein the low-coverage sequencing is between about 0.25 and 0.2×.

23. A system for detecting ploidy in an embryo, comprising: a data store for receiving an embryo sequence data; a computing device communicatively connected to the data store, the computing device comprising an ROI engine configured to align the received sequence data to a reference genome, and identify a region of interest in the aligned embryo sequence data; a SNP identification engine configured to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SMPs) in the sequence data by comparing the received sequence data to the aligned reference genome; and a scoring engine configured to determine a polyploid score comprising counting the number of observed SNPs in the region of interest, compare the polyploid score to a predetermined threshold, and identifying the embryo as polyploid if the polyploid score is below the predetermined threshold; and a display communicatively connected to the computing device and configured to display a report containing the polyploid classification of the embryo.
24. The system of claim 23, wherein the scoring engine is further configured to identify the embryo as euploid if the polyploid score is above the predetermined threshold.
25. (canceled)
26. The system of claim 23, wherein the polyploid is a balanced polyploid.
27. The system of claim 23, wherein the embryo sequence data is acquired by low-coverage sequencing.
28. The system of claim 27, wherein the low-coverage sequencing is between about 0.001 and 10×.
29. The system of claim 27, wherein the low-coverage sequencing is between about 0.01 and 0.5×.
