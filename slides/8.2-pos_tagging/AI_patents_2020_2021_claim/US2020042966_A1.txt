<abstract>
Methods, computer program products, and systems are presented. The method computer program products, and systems can include, for instance: registering a payment URL to a first user in response to receipt of registration data being received from a first user, wherein the payment URL is operative so that when the payment URL registered to the first user is activated by a second user, a web browsing session is commenced in which an electronic payment transaction is facilitated, the electronic payment transaction permitting electronic funds transfer from the second user to the first user; and examining location data of the second user in response to activation of the payment URL by the second user and determining one or more variable data values in dependence on the location data of the second user.
