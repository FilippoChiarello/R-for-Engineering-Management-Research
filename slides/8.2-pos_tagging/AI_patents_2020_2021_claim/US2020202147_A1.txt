SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR AUTOMATIC LABELING OF IMAGES FOR SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
A method of automatic labeling of images for supervised machine learning includes obtaining images of roadside objects with a camera mounted to a vehicle, recording a position and orientation of the vehicle within a defined coordinate system while obtaining the images recording position information for each roadside object with the same defined coordinates system as used while recording the position and orientation of the vehicle, and correlating a position of each of the obtained images of the roadside objects with the position information of each roadside object in view of the recorded position and orientation of the vehicle. The images are labeled to identify the roadside objects in view of the correlated position of each of the obtained images of the roadside objects.

<claims>
1. A method of automatic labeling of images for supervised machine learning comprising: obtaining images of roadside objects with a camera mounted to a vehicle; recording a position and orientation of the vehicle within a defined coordinate system while obtaining the images; recording position information for each roadside object with the same defined coordinates system as used while recording the position and orientation of the vehicle; correlating a position of each of the obtained images of the roadside objects with the position information of each roadside object in view of the recorded position and orientation of the vehicle; and labeling the images to identify the roadside objects in view of the correlated position of each of the obtained images of the roadside objects.
2. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the roadside objects comprises signs, and a high definition map includes positional information for each sign.
3. The method as recited in claim 2, the method comprising correlating a relative position of the vehicle to a position of the sign.
4. The method as recited in claim 3, the method comprising correcting a recorded orientation between the sign and the vehicle for optical characteristics of a video recording device.
5. The method as recited in claim 1, the method comprising generating a plurality of input-output pairs with the labeled images.
6. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the labeling step comprises providing a marking or outline on each of the roadside objects.
7. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the defined coordinate system is a Cartesian coordinate system.
8. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the recording a position and orientation of a vehicle step is performed using a DGPS/IMU system.
9. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the recording a position and orientation of a vehicle and recording position information for each roadside object steps are performed using a memory device of the vehicle.
10. The method as recited in claim 1, the method comprising obtaining a first timestamp data set associated with the images; obtaining a second timestamp data set associated with the position and orientation information; and wherein the correlating step includes synchronizing the first timestamp data set and the second timestamp data set.
11. The method as recited in claim 10, wherein the roadside objects comprises signs, and a high definition map includes positional information for each sign.
12. The method as recited in claim 11, the method comprising generating a plurality of input-output pairs with the labeled images.
13. The method as recited in claim 12, the method comprising wherein the labeling step comprises providing a marking or outline on each sign.
14. The method as recited in claim 13, the method comprising identifying at least one corner of each sign with a Cartesian coordinate.
15. A system for automatic labeling of images for supervised machine learning comprising: a camera mounted to a vehicle and configured to capture images of objects external to the vehicle; a DGPS/IMU system for determining position and orientation information of the vehicle during the capturing of the images of the objects; a memory device for recording the images and the associated position and orientation information; an HD map including HD map positional information for the objects; and at least one computing device programmed to synchronize the images, the positional and orientation information, and the HD map positional information and to label the objects in the images to provide a second set of images in which the objects are labeled.
16. The system as recited in claim 15, comprising at least one clock for providing a first timestamp data set associated with the images and a second timestamp dataset associated with the position and orientation information.
17. The system as recited in claim 15, wherein the at least one computing device includes a vehicle controller in communication with the camera, the DGPS/IMU system, and the HD map.
18. The system as recited in claim 17, wherein the vehicle controller includes the memory device.
