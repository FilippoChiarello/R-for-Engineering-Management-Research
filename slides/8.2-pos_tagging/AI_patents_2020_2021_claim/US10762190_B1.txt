Computer-based systems with programmed automatic real-time updatable browsing data objects and activity data objects and methods of use thereof

<abstract>
In order to provide improved matching of records between different sources, systems and methods include generating a data link between a stored interaction profile of the user and activity data records that identify activities performed by the user. Online interaction data associated with the user is received, including tracking data indicative of online interactions with content. The online interaction data is stored in the stored interaction profile associated with the user. An activity model is used to predict correlation parameters representing groupings of online interactions of the online interaction data with activities performed by the user, where the prediction is based on the tracking data and each activity in the interaction profile. The interaction profile is updated with the groupings and user activities are authenticated based on the interaction profile.

11. A method comprising: receiving, by at least one processor, an online interaction by a user with content associated with a third-party merchant; wherein the online interaction comprises tracking data; wherein the tracking data comprises: i) a third-party merchant indicator indicating the third-party merchant associated, ii) a product indicator indicating a product associated with the content, and iii) an interaction date indicator indicating a date of each online interaction; storing, by the at least one processor, the online interaction in an online interaction data object associated with the user; utilizing, by the at least one processor, an account activity model to predict a correlation parameter representing a grouping of the online interaction with one or more entity-related activities of at least one activity data record associated with the user based at least in part on the tracking data and each entity-related activity in the at least one activity data record; wherein each entity-related activity comprises: i) an activity type indicator that indicates a type of each respective entity-related activity of the one or more entity-related activities, ii) a related entity indicator that indicates at least one entity associated with each respective entity-related activity of the one or more entity-related activities, and iii) a date indicator that indicates a date associated with each respective entity-related activity of the one or more entity-related activities; updating, by the at least one processor, the stored interaction profile associated with the user based on each respective grouping of the respective online interactions of the at least one online interaction data object and the respective one or more activities of the activity data record using the at least one data link; and causing to display, by the at least one processor, an authentication of a user selection based on the correlation parameter representing the grouping of the online interaction with the one or more entity-related activities.
