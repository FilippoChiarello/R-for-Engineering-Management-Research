METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR LOW SAMPLING RATE ELECTRICAL LOAD DISAGGREGATION
</title>

<abstract>
This disclosure relates generally to method and system for low sampling rate electrical load disaggregation. At low sampling rates, disaggregation of energy load is challenging due to unavailability of events and signatures of the constituent loads. The disclosed energy disaggregation technique receives aggregated load data from a utility meter and sequentially obtains training data for determining disaggregated energy load at low sampling rate. Dictionaries are used to characterize the different loads in terms of power values and time of operation. The obtained dictionary coefficients are treated as graph signals and graph smoothness is used for propagating the coefficients from the training phase to the test phase by formulating an optimization model. The derivation of the optimization model identifies the load of interest and estimate their power consumption based on optimization model constraints. This method achieves accuracy greater than 70% for the loads of interest at low sampling rates.
