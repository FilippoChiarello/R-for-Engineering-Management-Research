POWER METER BASED MONITORING OF ELEVATOR USAGE
</title>

<abstract>
The invention refers to a system comprising an elevator monitoring device (300) for monitoring at least one elevator (200) operatively coupled to at least one motor (240) which is operatively connected to at least one power meter (260), wherein the elevator monitoring device (300) is configured to receive, from the power meter (260), data regarding the at least one motor (240) collected (S100) by the power meter (260),wherein the elevator monitoring device (300) is further configured to pre-process (S200) the data received from the power meter (260), andwherein the elevator monitoring device (300) further comprises a machine learning model (500) using an analytical algorithm for monitoring and/or assessing (S300) a status and/or a utilization of the elevator (200) based on the preprocessed data.
