<title>
Methods and systems for an automated design, fulfillment, deployment and operation platform for lighting installations
</title>

<abstract>
A platform for design of a lighting installation generally includes an automated search engine for retrieving and storing a plurality of lighting objects in a lighting object library and a lighting design environment providing a visual representation of a lighting space containing lighting space objects and lighting objects. The visual representation is based on properties of the lighting space objects and lighting objects obtained from the lighting object library. A plurality of aesthetic filters is configured to permit a designer in a design environment to adjust parameters of the plurality of lighting objects handled in the design environment to provide a desired collective lighting effect using the plurality of lighting objects.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for incrementally reconstructing a near-field illumination effect of a light source, comprising: capturing, by an indirect luminance collection device, a first occurrence of multi-dimensional luminance of the light source, with the indirect luminance collection device being disposed at a first position relative to the light source; capturing, by the indirect luminance collection device, a second occurrence of multi-dimensional luminance of the light source, with the indirect luminance collection device being disposed at a second position relative to the light source; producing a representation of the near-field illumination of the light source by applying a multi-dimensional near-field illumination reconstruction algorithm to the captured occurrences of multi-dimensional luminance of the light; storing the representation in a computer accessible non-volatile memory; and repeating the capturing the first occurrence, capturing the second occurrence producing the representation, and storing the representation for a plurality of positions relative to the light source to produce a model of near-field illumination of the light source.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the model of near-field illumination includes a plurality of data values for theta and phi luminance values for a plurality of three-dimensional locations in the near-field of the light source.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein a position relative to the light source includes a distance from the light source, a longitude relative to the light source and a latitude relative to the light source.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the plurality of positions includes a plurality of distances for a given longitude and latitude.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the plurality of positions includes a plurality of longitudes for a given distance.
6. The method of claim 3, wherein the plurality of positions includes a plurality of latitudes for a given distance.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the reconstruction algorithm determines a contribution of a point source on a surface of the light source for each captured occurrence.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein producing a representation of the near-field illumination includes applying at least one of the Kaczmarz method, numerical methods, machine learning methods, neural networks, and linear algebra to the captured occurrences of multi-dimensional luminance of the light.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein producing a representation of the near-field illumination includes applying at least two of the Kaczmarz method, numerical methods, machine learning methods, neural networks, and linear algebra to the captured occurrences of multi-dimensional luminance of the light.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the indirect luminance collection device includes a smartphone camera adapted to capture indirect luminance from the light source.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the smartphone camera adapted with a screen attached to the smartphone over the smartphone camera so that light from the light source impacts the smartphone camera indirectly.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein a portion of light from the light source passes through the screen.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the multi-dimensional representation constitutes a high-fidelity model of the light source.
14. The method of claim 1, further comprising controlling with a computer associated with the non-volatile memory, a distance between the light source and the indirect luminance collection device.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein capturing the first and second occurrences of multi-dimensional luminance of a light source includes capturing a light pattern visible on a secondary side of a translucent intermediate screen disposed between the light source and the indirect luminance collection device.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein the near-field illumination reconstruction algorithm produces a five-dimensional representation of the near-field.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein each value in the five-dimensional representation of the near-field is characterized by (i) a distance from a reference position on the indirect luminance collection device to the light source, (ii) a longitudinal offset from the reference point for the occurrence, (iii) a latitudinal offset from the reference point, (iv) a theta value of the illumination, and (v) a phi value for the illumination.
