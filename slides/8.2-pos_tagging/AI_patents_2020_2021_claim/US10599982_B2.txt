<title>
Internet of things based determination of machine reliability and automated maintainenace, repair and operation (MRO) logs
</title>

<abstract>
A computer implemented method and system for determining reliability of a machine includes receiving one of a machine data from one or more locations through an internet of things (IOT) based machine wearable sensor network. The method further includes storing the data in a distributed computer database communicatively coupled to an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and extracting, through a computer server, one or more entity information from the data to compare against a pre-defined baseline. Further, mapping, though a big data machine learning engine, the extracted one or more entity information into a multi-classification model. The method includes indicating, through a machine learning engine coupled to a predictive analytics engine, on a user interface a set of analytical predictions for machine maintenance, repair and operation.
