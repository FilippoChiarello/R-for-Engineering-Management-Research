VEHICLE CONTROL DEVICE, VEHICLE CONTROL METHOD, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
A model formula representing the relationship between an error between a predetermined stopping position and an actually-stopped position of a vehicle indicating the result of an automatic stop control, which controls the vehicle to stop at the predetermined stopping position using running-condition parameters, and the running-condition parameters used for the automatic stop control is calculated via machine learning. A stopping error is estimated with respect to the next stopping position, at which the vehicle currently running is going to stop, according to the model formula which is calculated in the past. The changing parameter to be changed is specified among the running-condition parameters, and then the changing parameter used for the automatic stop control is updated with a correction value configured to correct the stopping error of the vehicle.
