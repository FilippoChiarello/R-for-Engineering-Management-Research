ORDER CREATION SUPPORT APPARATUS AND ORDER CREATION SUPPORT METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An order creation support apparatus according to an embodiment includes a processing circuitry. The processing circuitry extracts existing order information similar to input new order information, from pieces of the existing order information, based on the similarity between the new order information and the existing order information. The processing circuitry also extracts representation commonly used for a specific item, from a character string included in the extracted existing order information, as common representation, and displays the new order information and support information based on the extracted common representation.

<claims>
1. An order creation support apparatus, comprising: a processing circuitry configured to extract existing order information similar to input new order information, from pieces of the order information, based on similarity between the new order information and the existing order information; extract representation commonly used for a specific item, from a character string included in the extracted existing order information, as common representation; and display the new order information and support information based on the extracted common representation.
2. The order creation support apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry extracts workflow information performed in response to the existing order information similar to the new order information, from pieces of the workflow information in which a work result performed in response to the existing order information is recorded, and extracts the common representation relating to the specific item included in the extracted workflow information.
3. The order creation support apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the processing circuitry divides the extracted workflow information into a plurality of groups, according to presence of the specific item or a setting content, and extracts the common representation relating to the specific item, from each of the divided groups.
4. The order creation support apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the processing circuitry divides the existing order information corresponding to the workflow information into two groups, according to whether the workflow information includes a work result instructing to recheck the existing order information, and extracts the common representation relating to the recheck from each of the divided groups.
5. The order creation support apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the processing circuitry divides the existing order information corresponding to the workflow information into a plurality of groups, according to a setting content of a resource recorded in the workflow information, and extracts the common representation relating to the resource from each of the divided groups.
6. The order creation support apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the processing circuitry determines an operational state of the resource, based on schedule information in which a work schedule of the resource is recorded, and displays the determined operational state of the resource, as the support information.
7. The order creation support apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry extracts the common representation from the existing order information, for a specific item included in the extracted existing order information.
8. The order creation support apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry displays the new order information and the support information on a same screen.
9. The order creation support apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry highlights and displays a character string corresponding to the common representation included in the new order information.
10. An order creation support method, comprising: extracting existing order information similar to input new order information, from pieces of the existing order information, based on similarity between the new order information and the existing order information; extracting representation commonly used for a specific item, from a character string included in the extracted existing order information, as common representation; and displaying the new order information and support information based on the extracted common representation.
