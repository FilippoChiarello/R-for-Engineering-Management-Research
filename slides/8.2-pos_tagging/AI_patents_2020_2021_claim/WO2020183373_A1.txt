MOBILE DEVICE-BASED SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR SELF-DIRECTED ASSIGNMENT OF FLEXIBLE DELIVERY WORK
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed embodiments provide systems and methods related to providing delivery offers for use with a user interface. A method for providing delivery offers comprises receiving, from a mobile device, a request for one or more delivery tasks including a geographical area and a time frame, accessing a database storing delivery tasks, each delivery task associated with a status of fully assigned, partially assigned, or not assigned based on a comparison of a number of workers assigned to the task and a number of workers necessary to complete the task, determining which of the stored delivery tasks needing assignment have a delivery route in the received geographical area and time frame, selecting one or more delivery offers if a status of each determined delivery offers is equal to partially assigned or not assigned, and responding to the received request by transmitting the one or more selected delivery offers to the mobile device.

storing the adjusted status of the accepted delivery offers in the
database;
10. A computer-implemented self-assignment method for providing delivery offers for use with a user interface, comprising:
receiving, from a mobile device, a request for one or more delivery tasks, an available time frame for performing the one or more delivery tasks, and a geographical area for performing the one or more delivery tasks;
accessing a database storing delivery tasks, each delivery task
associated with a status of fully assigned, partially assigned, or not assigned, the status being based on a comparison of:
a number of workers assigned to the task, and a number of workers necessary to complete the task;
determining which of the stored delivery tasks, from the database, needing assignment have a delivery route in the received geographical area;
determining one or more delivery offers by filtering the determined delivery tasks within the received available time frame; and selecting one or more delivery offers if a status of each determined delivery offers is equal to partially assigned or not assigned; and responding to the received request by transmitting one or more of the selected delivery offers to the mobile device.
1 1 . The method of claim 10, further comprising composing at least one of the selected delivery offers includes one or more delivery tasks to one or more neighboring destinations.
12. The method of claim 10, further comprising receiving from the mobile device the available time frame for performing delivery tasks as a slide bar representation in a user interface of the mobile device. 13. The method of claim 10, further comprising providing, for presentation via the mobile device, a user interface that includes selectable interface elements respectively corresponding to the one or more determined delivery offers, each of the determined delivery offers including one or more delivery locations, a number of packages, a time frame for the delivery, a time requirement for accepting the delivery offer, an amount of monetary compensation to be earned per package delivered, a transportation method of each of the determined delivery offers, or a location of each of the determined delivery offers on a map.
14. The method of claim 10, further comprising:
