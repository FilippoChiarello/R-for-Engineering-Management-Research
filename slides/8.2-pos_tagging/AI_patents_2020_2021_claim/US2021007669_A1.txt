ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE EARTIPS
</title>

<abstract>
An eartip includes a first portion that defines a cavity for receiving an earbud and an aperture. The eartip also includes a second portion that overlies the aperture and is formed of an electrically conductive material. An electrically conductive plug has a first end disposed within the aperture and a second end is coupled to the second portion to provide an electrically conductive path between the second portion and the cavity.

<claims>
1. An eartip comprising: a first portion defining a cavity for receiving an earbud and an aperture; and a second portion overlying the aperture and formed of an electrically conductive material, and an electrically conductive plug having a first end disposed within the aperture and a second end coupled to the second portion to provide an electrically conductive path between the second portion and the cavity.
2. The eartip of claim 1, wherein the first portion is not electrically conductive.
3. The eartip of claim 1, wherein the electrically conductive material comprises an elastomer and electrically conductive particles suspended in the elastomer.
4. The eartip of claim 3, wherein the electrically conductive material comprises an elastomer and an electrically conductive coating on a surface of the elastomer.
5. The eartip of claim 4, wherein the second portion comprises between 2.5% and 6% of the electrically conductive particles by weight.
6. The eartip of claim 1, wherein the eartip is formed in a two-shot molding process in which the first portion is formed in a first molding portion and the second portion is molded directly on top of the first portion in a second molding operation.
7. The eartip of claim 1, wherein the first portion is formed of a first elastomer having a first durometer, and wherein the second portion is formed of a second, electrically conductive elastomer having a second durometer that is softer than the first durometer.
8. An in-ear earpiece comprising: an earbud comprising: a transducer, and an electrically conductive pin; an eartip comprising: a first portion defining a cavity for receiving the earbud and an aperture, and a second portion overlying the aperture and formed of an electrically conductive material; and an electrically conductive plug having a first end disposed within the aperture and a second end coupled to the second portion to provide an electrically conductive path between the second portion and the electrically conductive pin.
9. The in-ear earpiece of claim 8, wherein the electrically conductive pin comprises a pogo pin.
10. The in-ear earpiece of claim 8, wherein the electrically conductive material comprises an elastomer and electrically conductive particles suspended in the elastomer.
11. The in-ear earpiece of claim 10, wherein the elastomer comprises silicone.
12. The in-ear earpiece of claim 11, wherein the second portion comprises between 2.5% and 6% of the electrically conductive particles by weight.
13. The in-ear earpiece of claim 8, wherein the first portion is formed of a first elastomer having a first durometer, and wherein the second portion is formed of a second, electrically conductive elastomer having a second durometer that is softer than the first durometer.
14. A relaxation mask defining a pair of eye cavities and comprising: a head strap for securing the relaxation mask to a subject's head such that the eye cavities overlie the subject's eyes; at least one biometric sensor configured to output data associated with a subject wearing the relaxation mask; and electronics being electrically coupled to the at least one biometric sensor, wherein the at least one biometric sensor comprises: an in-ear earpiece comprising: an earbud comprising: a transducer, and an electrically conductive pin; and an eartip comprising: a first portion defining a cavity for receiving the earbud and an aperture, and a second portion overlying the aperture and formed of an electrically conductive material; and an electrically conductive plug having a first end disposed within the aperture and a second end coupled to the second portion to provide an electrically conductive path between the second portion and the electrically conductive pin.
15. The relaxation mask of claim 14, wherein the electronics comprise: a memory coupled to a processor; and instructions stored in the memory that, when executed, cause the processor to: output a sensory stimulus; receive the output data from the at least one biometric sensor; correlate the output data and the sensory stimulus to identify a racing mind state; adjust one or more of an auditory, haptic, or visual stimulus of the relaxation mask in response to the identified racing mind state; and output the adjusted one or more auditory, haptic, or visual stimulus.
16. The relaxation mask of claim 14, wherein the electrically conductive pin comprises a pogo pin.
17. An in-ear earpiece comprising: an earbud comprising: a transducer, and an electrically conductive pin; and an eartip comprising: a first portion defining an aperture and a cavity for receiving the earbud such that the aperture is coaxially arranged with the electrically conductive pin, and a second portion overlying the aperture, the second portion being formed of an electrically conductive material; and wherein the second portion is electrically coupled to the electrically conductive pin.
