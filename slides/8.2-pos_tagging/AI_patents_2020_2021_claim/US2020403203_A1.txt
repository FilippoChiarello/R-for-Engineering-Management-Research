SEPARATORS FOR VRLA BATTERIES AND METHODS RELATING THERETO
</title>

<abstract>
Improved battery separators, batteries, and systems, as well as methods relating thereto are disclosed herein for use in various lead acid batteries such as valve-regulated lead acid (VRLA) batteries that include one or more AGM layers. The improved battery separators described herein may provide a battery system with an advantage of a significantly decreased acid filling time and a significantly increased acid filling speed. Various improved batteries, methods and systems are described herein using such improved battery separators that increase acid filling speed and decrease acid filling time for a VRLA battery.

<claims>
1. 1.-24. (canceled)
25. A battery separator comprising: at least one microporous polyolefin separator layer, said microporous polyolefin separator layer having a first surface and a second surface; at least said first surface comprising at least one of the list consisting of ribs, embossments, acid filling channels, and a combination thereof; at least said second surface comprising at least one of the list consisting of ribs, embossments, acid filling channels, mini cross ribs, and a combination thereof; said microporous polyolefin separator layer comprises first areas comprising a first set of pores and a compressed pore structure; and further comprises second areas comprising a second set of pores and a pore structure less compressed than the pore structure of the first areas; and, wherein said embossments are textured embossments, straight pattern embossments, wavy pattern embossments, embossments in a picture pattern, zigzag pattern embossments, or a combination thereof.
26. The battery separator of claim 25, wherein said first set of pores are smaller than said second set of pores.
27. The battery separator of claim 25, wherein said microporous polyolefin separator layer comprises polyethylene and silica.
28. The battery separator of claim 25, wherein said ribs are about 8.0 μm to about 1.0 mm tall.
29. The battery separator of claim 25 wherein said ribs are spaced about 1.0 μm to about 10 mm apart.
30. The battery separator of claim 1, further comprising at least one first Absorptive Glass Mat ("AGM") layer adjacent to one of said first surface or said second surface.
31. The battery separator of claim 30, wherein said at least one first AGM layer comprises glass fibers, polymeric fibers, or a combination thereof.
32. The battery separator of claim 1, wherein said at least one first AGM is nonwoven.
33. The battery separator of claim 1, comprising at least one second AGM layer adjacent to one of said first surface or said second surface.
34. The battery separator of claim 32, wherein said at least one second AGM layer is adjacent to a surface that is opposite of said at least one first AGM layer.
35. The battery separator of claim 1, wherein said separator is about 10% to about 40% compressible at a pressure at least about 10 kPa.
36. The battery separator of claim 1, wherein said first surface comprises ribs, embossments, and acid filling channels.
37. The battery separator of claim 1, wherein said second surface at least comprises mini cross ribs.
38. The battery separator of claim 1, further comprising a coating of a surfactant on at least one of said first surface or said second surface of said microporous polyolefin separator layer.
39. A composite battery separator comprising: at least one microporous polyolefin separator layer, said microporous polyolefin separator layer having a first surface and a second surface; at least said first surface comprising at least one feature selected from the group consisting of ribs, embossments, acid filling channels, and a combination thereof; at least said second surface comprising at least one feature selected from the group consisting of ribs, embossments, acid filling channels, mini cross ribs, and a combination thereof; said microporous polyolefin separator layer comprises first areas comprising a first set of pores and a compressed pore structure; and further comprises second areas comprising a second set of pores and a pore structure less compressed than the pore structure of the first areas; and at least one first mat or nonwoven layer adjacent to one of said first surface or said second surface, and wherein said feature is adjacent said first mat or nonwoven layer.
40. The separator of claim 39, wherein said first mat or nonwoven layer of the composite separator is adapted to be placed against a positive electrode.
41. The separator of claim 39, wherein said first mat or nonwoven layer is adapted to be placed against a negative electrode.
42. The separator of claim 39, wherein said microporous polyolefin separator layer has a bi-modal pore size.
43. The separator of claim 1, wherein said microporous polyolefin separator layer has a bi-modal pore size.
44. The separator of claim 43, comprising at least one AGM layer adjacent to one of said first surface or said second surface.
