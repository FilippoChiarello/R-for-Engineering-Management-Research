<title>
MACHINE LEARNING ASSISTANT FOR IMAGE ANALYSIS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods, and non-transitory computer readable media are provided for labeling depictions of objects within images. An image may be obtained. The image may include a depiction of an object. A user's marking of a set of dots within the image may be received. The set of dots may include one or more dots. The set of dots may be positioned within or near the depiction of the object. The depiction of the object within the image may be labeled based on the set of dots.

<claims>
1. 1-20. (canceled)
21. A system comprising: one or more processors; memory storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the system to perform: obtaining an image, the image including a depiction of an object; receiving a user's marking of a set of dots within the image, the set of dots including one or more dots positioned within or near the depiction of the object; and labeling the depiction of the object within the image based on a number of dots within the set of dots.
22. The system of claim 21, wherein labeling the depiction of the object within the image indicates a confidence of an identity of the object based on the number of dots within the set of dots.
23. The system of claim 21, wherein labeling the depiction of the object within the image indicates a size of the object based on the number of dots within the set of dots.
24. The system of claim 21, wherein labeling the depiction of the object within the image is based on a type of dots within the set of dots.
25. The system of claim 21, wherein labeling the depiction of the object within the image based on the set of dots includes identifying a boundary of the object depicted within the image based on position of the set of dots within the image.
26. The system of claim 25, wherein the position of the set of dots within the image indicates a middle portion of the object.
27. The system of claim 25, wherein the position of the set of dots within the image indicates a boundary portion of the object.
28. The system of claim 25, wherein the position of the set of dots within the image indicates a nearby depiction of the object.
29. The system of claim 21, wherein a label of the depiction of the object within the image is used to train a machine learning model for identifying other depictions of the object within other images.
30. The system of claim 29, wherein identifications of the other depictions of the object within the other images are filtered based on an object size criteria or an object shape criteria.
31. A method implemented by a computing system including one or more processors and storage media storing machine-readable instructions, wherein the method is performed using the one or more processors, the method comprising: obtaining an image, the image including a depiction of an object; receiving a user's marking of a set of dots within the image, the set of dots including one or more dots positioned within or near the depiction of the object; and labeling the depiction of the object within the image based on a number of dots within the set of dots.
32. The method of claim 31, wherein labeling the depiction of the object within the image indicates a confidence of an identity of the object based on the number of dots within the set of dots.
33. The method of claim 31, wherein labeling the depiction of the object within the image indicates a size of the object based on the number of dots within the set of dots.
34. The method of claim 31, wherein labeling the depiction of the object within the image is based on a type of dots within the set of dots.
35. The method of claim 31, wherein labeling the depiction of the object within the image based on the set of dots includes identifying a boundary of the object depicted within the image based on position of the set of dots within the image.
36. The method of claim 35, wherein the position of the set of dots within the image indicates a middle portion of the object.
37. The system of claim 35, wherein the position of the set of dots within the image indicates a boundary portion of the object.
38. The method of claim 35, wherein the position of the set of dots within the image indicates a nearby depiction of the object.
39. The method of claim 31, wherein a label of the depiction of the object within the image is used to train a machine learning model for identifying other depictions of the object within other images.
40. The method of claim 39, wherein identifications of the other depictions of the object within the other images are filtered based on an object size criteria or an object shape criteria.
