<title>
Identification of air leaks in a compressed air system using a plurality of current measurement sensors
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus and method for identification of air leaks in a compressed air system are presented. The method includes receiving system data including current samples of air compressors of the compressed air system from at least one self-powered power sensor; aggregating the system data; dividing the aggregated system data into a plurality of clusters; merging overlapping clusters to reduce the number of clusters to two clusters, wherein a first cluster represents a baseload current and a second cluster represents a full-load current; determining the baseload current to full-load current ratio and comparing the ratio to a predetermined standard; and determining if an air leak is present if the ratio is below the predetermined standard.

A method for identification of air leaks in a compressed air system, comprising: receiving system data including current samples of air compressors of the compressed air system from at least one self-powered power sensor; aggregating the system data; dividing the aggregated system data into a plurality of clusters; merging overlapping clusters to reduce the number of clusters to two clusters, wherein a first cluster represents a baseload current and a second cluster represents a full-load current; determining the baseload current to full-load current ratio and comparing the ratio to a predetermined standard; and determining if an air leak is present if the ratio is below the predetermined standard.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein aggregating the system data further comprises: extracting and averaging air compression current measurements.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: applying noise reduction to the plurality of clusters.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: providing a notification when an air leak is determined to be present.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein dividing the aggregated system data into the plurality of clusters further comprises: applying a gaussian mixture model (GMM).
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: performing a linear regression between the baseload current and corresponding time-stamps.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising: determining if a trend of the linear regression is above a predetermined threshold.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising: determining the air leak when a p-value of the linear regression trend is above a predetermined threshold.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising: segmenting air pipes of the compressed air system into at least two segments if an air leak is determined to be present; collecting current measurement samples for each segment over a predetermined period of time; and determining, if the air leak is present, which segment contains the air leak.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising: providing a notification of which segment contains the air leak.
11. A non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon instructions for causing a processing circuitry to perform a process, the process comprising: receiving system data including current samples of air compressors of a compressed air system from at least one self-powered power sensor; aggregating the system data; dividing the aggregated system data into a plurality of clusters; merging overlapping clusters to reduce the number of clusters to two clusters, wherein a first cluster represents a baseload current and a second cluster represents a full-load current; determining the baseload current to full-load current ratio and comparing the ratio to a predetermined standard; and determining if an air leak is present if the ratio is below the predetermined standard.
