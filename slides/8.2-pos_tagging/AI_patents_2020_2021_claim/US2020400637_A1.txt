MACHINE LEARNING STABILIZATION OF GAS SENSOR OUTPUT
</title>

<abstract>
A system for stabilizing sensor readings. The system includes a processor; a memory communicatively coupled to the processor; a receiver to receive from a sensing device, a measurement and an environmental parameter. The system also includes a machine learning engine executed on the processor wherein the machine learning engine receives, as inputs: the environmental parameters; the measurement; and control parameters calculated based on control measurements made at time points before and after the measurement.
