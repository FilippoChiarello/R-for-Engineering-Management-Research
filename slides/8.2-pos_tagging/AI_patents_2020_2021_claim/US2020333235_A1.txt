USE OF MULTI-FREQUENCY IMPEDANCE CYTOMETRY IN CONJUNCTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING FOR CLASSIFICATION OF BIOLOGICAL PARTICLES
</title>

<abstract>
This disclosure provides methods and systems for classifying biological particles, e.g., blood cells, microbes, circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Using impedance flow cytometry, such as multi-frequency impedance cytometry, in conjunction with supervised machine learning, the disclosed methods and systems demonstrated improved accuracy in classifying biological particles.
