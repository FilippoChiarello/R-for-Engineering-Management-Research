<title>
Using machine learning to detect communication channel abnormalities in an ICS/IIoT application
</title>

<abstract>
This disclosure provides a security system and method for using machine learning to improve cybersecurity operations in an industrial control networks and other systems. A method includes collecting, by a security system, current communications channel information for a plurality of devices in a control system. The method includes analyzing, by the security system, the current communications channel information according to one or more device models. The method includes producing, by the security system and according to the analysis, a risk report that identifies an abnormal device among the plurality of devices.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: collecting, by a security system, current communications channel information for a plurality of devices in a control system; augmenting one or more device models according to the communications channel information, wherein augmenting includes tuning model hyperparameters to create and test one or more models; analyzing, by the security system, the current communications channel information according to one or more device models; and producing, by the security system and according to the analysis, a risk report that identifies an abnormal device among the plurality of devices.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: collecting, by the security system, known-good communications channel information for the plurality of devices in the control system; and augmenting, by the security system, the one or more device models according to the known-good communications channel information.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the security system collects the known-good communications channel information and augments the one or more device models repeatedly, occasionally, or continuously.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the current communications channel information includes distributed control system (DCS) data or Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) operations data.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the current communications channel information includes controller operations data.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the current communications channel information includes asset management operations data.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the current communications channel information is collected from a wired or wireless network.
8. A security system, comprising: a controller; and a memory in communication with the controller, wherein the controller is configured to: collect current communications channel information for a plurality of devices in a control system; augment one or more device models according to the communications channel information, wherein augmenting includes tuning model hyperparameters to create and test one or more models; analyze the current communications channel information according to one or more device models; and produce, according to the analysis, a risk report that identifies an abnormal device among the plurality of devices.
9. The security system of claim 8, wherein the controller is further configured to: collect known-good communications channel information for the plurality of devices in the control system; and augment the one or more device models according to the known-good communications channel information.
10. The security system of claim 9, wherein the security system collects the known-good communications channel information and augments the one or more device models repeatedly, occasionally, or continuously.
11. The security system of claim 8, wherein the current communications channel information includes distributed control system (DCS) data or Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) operations data.
12. The security system of claim 8, wherein the current communications channel information includes controller operations data.
13. The security system of claim 8, wherein the current communications channel information includes asset management operations data.
14. The security system of claim 8, wherein the current communications channel information is collected from a wired or wireless network.
15. A non-transitory machine-readable medium encoded with executable instructions that, when executed, cause one or more controllers of a security system to: collect current communications channel information for a plurality of devices in a control system; augment one or more device models according to the communications channel information, wherein augmenting includes tuning model hyperparameters to create and test one or more models; analyze the current communications channel information according to one or more device models; and produce, according to the analysis, a risk report that identifies an abnormal device among the plurality of devices.
16. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the non-transitory machine-readable medium is further encoded with executable instructions that, when executed, cause the one or more controllers of the security system to: collect known-good communications channel information for the plurality of devices in the control system; and augment the one or more device models according to the known-good communications channel information.
17. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 16, wherein the security system collects the known-good communications channel information and augments the one or more device models repeatedly, occasionally, or continuously.
18. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 15 wherein the current communications channel information includes distributed control system (DCS) data or Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) operations data.
19. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the current communications channel information includes controller operations data.
20. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the current communications channel information includes asset management operations data.
