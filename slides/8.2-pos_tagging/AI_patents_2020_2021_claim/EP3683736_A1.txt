MACHINE LEARNING METHOD, MACHINE LEARNING PROGRAM, AND MACHINE LEARNING APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented machine learning method of a machine learning model includes: performing(S1) first training of the machine learning model by using pieces of training data associated with a correct label; determining(S3,S4), from the pieces of training data, a set of pieces of training data that are close to each other in a feature space based on a core tensor generated by the trained machine learning model and have a same correct label; generating(S6) extended training data based on the determined set of pieces of training data; and performing(S7) second training of the trained machine learning model by using the generated extended training data.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented machine learning method of a machine learning model comprising: Performing(S1) first training of the machine learning model by using pieces of training data associated with a correct label; Determining(S3,S4), from the pieces of training data, a set of pieces of training data that are close to each other in a feature space based on a core tensor generated by the trained machine learning model and have a same correct label; Generating(S6) extended training data based on the determined set of pieces of training data; and Performing(S7) second training of the trained machine learning model by using the generated extended training data.
2. The learning method according to claim 1, wherein the generating includes generating, based on the set of pieces of training data associated with the correct label, the extended training data associated with the correct label.
3. The learning method according to claim 1, wherein the generating includes generating the extended training data in accordance with a range based on a redundancy rate of the determined set of pieces of training data in the feature space.
4. A machine learning program causing a computer to perform: Performing(S1) first training of the machine learning model by using pieces of training data associated with a correct label; Determining(S3,S4), from the pieces of training data, a set of pieces of training data that are close to each other in a feature space based on a core tensor generated by the trained machine learning model and have a same correct label; Generating(S6) extended training data based on the determined set of pieces of training data; and Performing(S7) second training of the trained machine learning model by using the generated extended training data.
5. The machine learning program according to claim 4, wherein the generating includes generating, based on the set of pieces of training data associated with the correct label, the extended training data associated with the correct label.
6. The machine learning program according to claim 4, wherein the generating includes generating the extended training data in accordance with a range based on a redundancy rate of the determined set of pieces of training data in the feature space.
7. A machine learning apparatus comprising: a first training unit that performs first training of the machine learning model by using pieces of training data associated with a correct label; a determining unit that performs, on a basis of a core tensor generated by the trained machine learning model, determination of whether each extended training data generated from the pieces of training data is adoptable as training data of the trained machine learning model; and a second training unit that performs second training of the trained machine learning model by using the extended training data in accordance with a result of the determination.
8. The machine learning apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the second training unit performs when the result indicates that the extended training is adoptable.
