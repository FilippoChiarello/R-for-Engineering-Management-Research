SEMI-SUPERVISED AUTOMATIC MARKING METHOD AND DEVICE FOR GROUND-OBJECT IN HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGE
</title>

<abstract>
The embodiment of the present invention provides a semi-supervised automatic marking method for spartina alterniflora in a hyperspectral image. According to the semi-supervised automatic marking method for spartina alterniflora in a hyperspectral image provided by the present invention, based on the dimensionality reduction on 108-dimensional data of 18 wave bands, unsupervised clustering is performed by the fast clustering algorithm based on the local density, and then the clustering result is matched with a marked spartina alterniflora data set, so that completely automatic marking of the data is realized, and automatic marking for spartina alterniflora is realized. The embodiment of the present invention also provides a semi-supervised automatic marking device for spartina alterniflora in a hyperspectral image. Through the technical scheme provided by the embodiment of the present invention, recognition and marking for spartina alterniflora can be realized accurately and effectively.
