SKETCHING USING A HYBRID QUANTUM-CLASSICAL SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
In an embodiment, a method of sketching using a hybrid quantum-classical system includes creating a set of clustered data sets from a first data set. In an embodiment, the method includes evaluating, using a quantum processor and quantum memory, the set of clustered data sets. In an embodiment, the method includes evaluating, using the quantum processor and quantum memory, a set of quality metrics for the set of clustered data sets. In an embodiment, the method includes reclustering, responsive to at least one of the set of quality metrics failing to meet a quality criterion, the first data set.
