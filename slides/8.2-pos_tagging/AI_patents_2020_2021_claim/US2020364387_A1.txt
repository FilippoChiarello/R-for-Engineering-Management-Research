OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE SYSTEM AND METHOD EMPLOYING DIGITAL TWINS
</title>

<abstract>
Operations and maintenance (O&M) system, and related methods, for a plurality of unique objects employing distinct digital twins. The O&M system comprises: a database subsystem for storing at least first and second distinct digital twins for each of the plurality of unique objects, each of the distinct digital twins having an identifier that uniquely associates it with one of the plurality of unique objects and which defines a unique virtual representation thereof. The system further includes a sensor subsystem operative to obtain operational data for each of the plurality of unique objects, and a digital twin comparison subsystem operative to compare outputs of the at least first and second distinct digital twins for each of the plurality of unique objects; the output of each distinct digital twin is a function of the operational data for its associated unique object, and the O&M system makes an operational or maintenance decision with respect to an object as a function of the comparison.

<claims>
We claim:
1. An operations and maintenance (O&M) system for a plurality of unique objects, said O&M system comprising: a database subsystem for storing at least first and second distinct digital twins for each of said plurality of unique objects, each of said distinct digital twins having an identifier that uniquely associates it with one of said plurality of unique objects and which defines a unique virtual representation thereof; a sensor subsystem operative to obtain operational data for each of said plurality of unique objects; and, a digital twin comparison subsystem operative to compare outputs of said at least first and second distinct digital twins for each of said plurality of unique objects, said output of each distinct digital twin being a function of the operational data for its associated unique object, said O&M system making an operational or maintenance decision with respect to an object as a function of said comparison.
2. The O&M system recited in claim 1, wherein said sensor subsystem stores unique operational data for each instance of an object.
3. The O&M system recited in claim 1, wherein said sensor subsystem aggregates operational data for similar ones of said plurality of unique objects.
4. The O&M system recited in claim 3, wherein said output of a digital twin is a function of said aggregate operational data for said plurality of unique objects.
5. The O&M system recited in claim 3, wherein said operational or maintenance decision of said O&M system with respect to an object is a function of said aggregate operational data for said similar ones of said plurality of unique objects.
6. The O&M system recited in claim 1, wherein ones of said plurality of unique objects are uniquely associated with a plurality of digital twin types, each digital twin type providing a different representation of an associated object.
7. The O&M system recited in claim 1, wherein a virtual representation associated with a digital twin comprises a representation of the normal functioning of an associated object.
8. The O&M system recited in claim 1, wherein a virtual representation associated with a digital twin comprises a representation of a failure mode of an associated object.
9. The O&M system recited in claim 1, wherein a virtual representation associated with a digital twin comprises a maintenance schedule for an associated object.
10. The O&M system recited in claim 1, wherein one or more of said database subsystem, said sensor subsystem, and said digital twin comparison subsystem are physically hosted remotely from said plurality of unique objects.
11. The O&M system recited in claim 1, wherein a digital twin is associated with a sub-element of an associated object.
12. The O&M system recited in claim 1, wherein said decision is based on a coherent comparison of said first and second distinct digital twins.
13. The O&M system recited in claim 1, wherein said decision is based on a weighted comparison of said first and second distinct digital twins.
14. The O&M system recited in claim 13, wherein said weighted comparison is a function of confidence values associated with each of said distinct digital twins.
15. The O&M system recited in claim 1, further comprising an artificial intelligence (AI) subsystem, wherein said O&M system makes said operational or maintenance decision with respect to an object as a function of processing said comparison by said AI subsystem.
16. The O&M system recited in claim 15, wherein said operational or maintenance decision with respect to an object is a function of a deviation of said comparison from a nominal value.
17. The O&M system recited in claim 16, wherein said nominal value is variable as a function of historical operational data from one or more of said plurality of unique objects.
18. A method for use in an operations and maintenance (O&M) system for a plurality of unique objects, said method comprising: storing at least first and second distinct digital twins for each of said plurality of unique objects, each of said distinct digital twins having an identifier that uniquely associates it with one of said plurality of unique objects and which defines a virtual representation thereof; obtaining operational data for each of said plurality of unique objects; and, comparing outputs of said at least first and second distinct digital twins for each of said plurality of unique objects, said output of each distinct digital twin being a function of the operational data for its associated unique object, said O&M system making an operational or maintenance decision with respect to an object as a function of said comparison.
19. The method recited in claim 18, wherein said system stores unique operational data for each instance of an object.
20. The method recited in claim 18, wherein said system aggregates operational data for similar ones of said plurality of unique objects.
21. The method recited in claim 20, wherein said output of a digital twin is a function of said aggregate operational data for said plurality of unique objects.
22. The method recited in claim 20, wherein said operational or maintenance decision of said O&M system with respect to an object is a function of said aggregate operational data for said similar ones of said plurality of unique objects.
23. The method recited in claim 18, wherein ones of said plurality of objects are uniquely associated with a plurality of digital twin types, each digital twin type providing a different representation of an associated object.
24. The method recited in claim 18, wherein a virtual representation associated with a digital twin comprises a representation of the normal functioning of an associated object.
25. The method recited in claim 18, wherein a virtual representation associated with a digital twin comprises a representation of a failure mode of an associated object.
26. The method recited in claim 18, wherein a virtual model associated with a digital twin comprises a maintenance schedule for an associated object.
27. The method recited in claim 18, wherein a digital twin is associated with a sub-element of an associated object.
28. The method recited in claim 18, wherein said decision is based on a coherent comparison of said first and second digital twins.
29. The method recited in claim 18, wherein said decision is based on a weighted comparison of said first and second distinct digital twins.
30. The method recited in claim 29, wherein said weighted comparison is a function of confidence values associated with each of said distinct digital twins.
31. The method recited in claim 18, further comprising making said operational decision with respect to an object as a function of processing said comparison by an artificial intelligence (AI) subsystem.
32. The method recited in claim 31, wherein said operational or maintenance decision with respect to an object is a function of a deviation of said comparison from a nominal value.
33. The method recited in claim 32, wherein said nominal value is variable as a function of historical operational data from one or more of said plurality of unique objects.
