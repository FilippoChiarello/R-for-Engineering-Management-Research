<title>
Intravascular plaque detection in OCT images
</title>

<abstract>
Detection of intravascular plaque in OCT images is carried out by obtaining images of vascular tissue from a vascular component by OCT either in a static mode of a single image or in a dynamic mode where the images are obtained by scanning. The method acts by dividing the OCT image into different regular regions, calculating different texture features for each of the above regions with a reduced set of less than a full set of the 26 Haralick textural features, using a clustering algorithm to segment the image defined by its texture features calculated above into different regions and transforming the segmented image back from its representation using texture features to its space-domain representation. The method uses three or four texture features where the reduced sets can be f1, f 2, and f14 (ASM at 0°, Inertia at 0° and ASM at 90°).

<claims>
1. A method for detection of intravascular plaque in OCT images comprising: Obtaining at least one image of vascular tissue from a vascular component by OCT; dividing the OCT image into different regular regions; calculating different texture features for each of the above regions with a reduced set only three or four textural features of the full set of Haralick textural features; using a clustering algorithm to segment the image as now defined by its texture features calculated above into different regions; wherein the three or four textural features comprise f1, f2, and f14, wherein f1 represents Angular Second Moment at orientation 0 degrees, f2 represents Inertia at orientation 0 degrees and f14 represents Angular Second Moment at orientation 90 degrees.
2. The method according to claim 1 wherein the reduced set of textural features consists only of f1, f2, and f14.
3. The method according to claim 1 including the step of transforming the segmented image back from its representation using texture features to its space-domain representation.
4. The method according to claim 1 wherein the clustering algorithm comprises Fuzzy C-means.
5. The method according to claim 1 wherein the clustering algorithm comprises K-means.
6. The method according to claim 1 wherein the reduced number of features is selected and arranged so as to decrease the computation time without losing any textural information.
7. The method according to claim 1 including paralleling the algorithms for the reduced number of features so that they are calculated in parallel rather than sequentially so as to further decrease the computation time.
8. The method according to claim 6 wherein the paralleling is done using a CUDA machine.
9. The method according to claim 1 wherein the reduced number of features is selected and arranged so as to reduce the computation time by more than four times.
10. The method according to claim 1 wherein the reduced number of features is selected and arranged for use in real time applications of intravascular plaque detection using OCT images.
11. The method according to claim 10 wherein there is provided a presentation to a technician of a real time image of the plaque detection as the vascular component is scanned using the apparatus.
12. The method according to claim 10 wherein the OCT images are obtained by an optical fiber which is pulled through the vascular component.
13. The method according to claim 1 wherein vascular plaque from OCT images in a dynamic case is detected from a sequence of overlapping images obtained by moving an OCT probe over underlying tissue.
14. The method according to claim 13 wherein the step size with which the OCT probe moves over the tissue is small compared to the probe's field of view so that each obtained image has many pixels in common with a previous image.
