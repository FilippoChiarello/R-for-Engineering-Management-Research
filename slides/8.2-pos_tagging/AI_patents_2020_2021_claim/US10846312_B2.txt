<title>
Selection apparatus, selection method and selection program
</title>

<abstract>
A selection apparatus selects a variable with a range of values of a data group from an observation target. The processor generates a plurality of clusters by clustering a representative data group representing the variable for each of a plurality of the data groups corresponding to a plurality of the variables based on similarity of the representative data group, generates a map by plotting the representative data group on a coordinate plane constituted by a first axis related to a first component and a second axis related to a second component, and selects, by selecting specific representative data from among one or more pieces of representative data belonging to each of the plurality of clusters, a specific variable represented by the specific representative data based on a circle having a center at an origin of the map.

<claims>
1. A selection apparatus that selects a variable which is a range of possible values of a data group from an observation target, the apparatus comprising: a processor configured to execute a program; and a storage device configured to store the program, wherein the processor generates a plurality of clusters by clustering a representative data group representing the variable for each of a plurality of the data groups corresponding to a plurality of the variables based on similarity of the representative data group, generates a map by plotting the representative data group on a coordinate plane constituted by a first axis related to a first component defining a first characteristic of each piece of data of the representative data group and a second axis related to a second component defining a second characteristic, and selects, by selecting specific representative data from among one or more pieces of representative data belonging to each of the plurality of clusters, a specific variable represented by the specific representative data based on a circle having a center at an origin of the map.
2. The selection apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the first component and the second component each have a characteristic of being worth to be selected as being farther away from the origin, and the processor selects, at the outside of the circle, representative data farthest from the origin from among the one or more pieces of representative data belonging to each of the plurality of clusters as the specific representative data.
3. The selection apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the first component and the second component each have a characteristic of being worth to be selected as being closer to the origin, and the processor selects, at the inside of the circle, representative data closest to the origin from among the one or more pieces of representative data belonging to each of the plurality of clusters as the specific representative data.
4. The selection apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the storage device stores priority information specifying one or more variables to be prioritized from among the plurality of variables, and the processor selects, based on the circle having the center at the origin of the map, representative data related to a variable specified by the priority information from among the one or more pieces of representative data belonging to each of the plurality of clusters as the specific representative data.
5. The selection apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the storage device stores designation information designating one or more variables from among the plurality of variables, and the processor calculates, based on the circle having the center at the origin of the map, an agreement rate of the variable based on the number of pieces of representative data related to a variable specified by the designation information and the number of pieces of the specific representative data among the one or more pieces of representative data belonging to each of the plurality of clusters.
6. The selection apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor generates a bar graph indicating a distance between the origin and the representative data, and a threshold of the distance corresponding to the radius of the circle for each of the representative data group on the map, and changes, in conjunction with change of the magnitude of either one of the radius of the circle or the threshold, the magnitude of the other.
7. The selection apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor converts, by principle component analysis using a plurality of observation data groups from a plurality of the observation targets, the plurality of observation data groups corresponding to the variable into the data group constituted by a plurality of components including the first component and the second component, and generates the plurality of clusters by clustering, for each of the plurality of converted data groups, the representative data group representing the variable based on the similarity of the representative data group.
8. A selection method by a selection apparatus that selects a variable which is a range of possible values of a data group from an observation target, the apparatus including a processor that executes a program and a storage device that stores the program, the selection method comprising: generating, by the processor, a plurality of clusters by clustering a representative data group representing the variable for each of a plurality of the data groups corresponding to a plurality of the variables based on similarity of the representative data group; generating, by the processor, a map by plotting the representative data group on a coordinate plane constituted by a first axis related to a first component defining a first characteristic of each piece of data of the representative data group and a second axis related to a second component defining a second characteristic; and selecting, by the processor, by selecting specific representative data from among one or more pieces of representative data belonging to each of the plurality of clusters, a specific variable represented by the specific representative data based on a circle having a center at an origin of the map.
9. A selection program for causing a processor to select a variable which is a range of possible values of a data group from an observation target, the processor executes: generating a plurality of clusters by clustering a representative data group representing the variable for each of a plurality of the data groups corresponding to a plurality of the variables based on similarity of the representative data group; generating a map by plotting the representative data group on a coordinate plane constituted by a first axis related to a first component defining a first characteristic of each piece of data of the representative data group and a second axis related to a second component defining a second characteristic; and selecting by selecting specific representative data from among one or more pieces of representative data belonging to each of the plurality of clusters, a specific variable represented by the specific representative data based on a circle having a center at an origin of the map.
