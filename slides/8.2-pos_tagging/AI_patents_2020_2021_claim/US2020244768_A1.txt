<title>
METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR PERSONALIZING USER EXPERIENCE BASED ON PERSONALITY TRAITS
</title>

<abstract>
An electronic device associated with a media-providing service assigns one or more characteristics of media items to at least one respective personality trait of a plurality of personality traits. The media items are provided by the media-providing service. The electronic device assigns one or more user behaviors to a first personality trait and tracks behavior of a user. The electronic device determines that a tracked behavior of the user corresponds to a first user behavior of the one or more user behaviors and assigns the first personality trait to the user based at least in part on determining that the tracked behavior of the user corresponds to the first user behavior. The electronic device provides personalized content to the user in accordance with a determination that the degree to which the tracked behavior of the user corresponds to the first user behavior satisfies a threshold.

<claims>
1. (canceled)
2. A method, comprising: at an electronic device associated with a media-providing service having one or more processors and memory storing instructions for execution by the one or more processors: tracking behavior of a user over a predefined time period; determining that at least a portion of the tracked behavior is associated with a first personality trait identified by the media-providing service; based at least in part on the tracked behavior, assigning the first personality trait to the user; and providing to the user, personalized content associated with the first personality trait assigned to the user.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: identifying one or more characteristics of media items as relating to at least one respective personality trait of a plurality of personality traits; and assigning one or more user behaviors to the respective personality trait.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein determining that at least a portion of the tracked behavior is associated with the first personality trait comprises determining that the tracked behavior of the user corresponds to a first user behavior of the one or more user behaviors.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein tracking behavior of the user comprises storing information about the tracked behavior in a listening history of the user.
6. The method of claim 2, further comprising, at the electronic device: assigning the user a second personality trait based at least in part on a listening history of the user; and providing personalized content to the user based on the second personality trait.
7. The method of claim 2, wherein tracking the user behavior includes tracking use of a shuffle feature by the user.
8. The method of claim 2, wherein tracking the user behavior includes tracking use of a skip feature by the user.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein: tracking the use of the skip feature comprises counting a number of media items the user skips before completing playback; and assigning the first personality trait to the user comprises labeling the user as neurotic in response to determining that the number of media items the user skips satisfies a threshold.
10. The method of claim 2, wherein providing the personalized content comprises changing a tone of voice for messages for presentation to the user based on the first personality trait.
11. The method of claim 2, wherein providing the personalized content comprises promoting, to the user, a content source associated with the first personality trait.
12. The method of claim 2, wherein providing the personalized content comprises selecting media items to recommend to the user from one or more content sources of the media-providing service.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the one or more content sources of the media-providing service comprise one or more radio stations.
14. The method of claim 2, further comprising, at the electronic device, determining an interest level corresponding to a user preference for a first content type over a second content type, based at least in part on the assigned first personality trait; wherein the personalized content is provided to the user based on the interest level.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the interest level is an interest level in a message.
16. The method of claim 2, wherein assigning the first personality trait to the user is further based at least in part on one or more demographic variables for the user.
17. The method of claim 2, wherein the first personality trait is selected from the group consisting of: openness, agreeableness, extroversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness.
18. The method of claim 2, wherein the first personality trait corresponds to the Meyers-Briggs personality model.
19. An electronic device of a media-providing service, comprising: one or more processors; and memory storing one or more programs for execution by the one or more processors, the one or more programs comprising instructions for: tracking behavior of a user over a predefined time period; determining that at least a portion of the tracked behavior is associated with a first personality trait identified by the media-providing service; based at least in part on the tracked behavior, assigning the first personality trait to the user; and providing, to the user, personalized content associated with the first personality trait assigned to the user.
20. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing one or more programs configured for execution by an electronic device of a media-providing service, the one or more programs comprising instructions for: tracking behavior of a user over a predefined time period; determining that at least a portion of the tracked behavior is associated with a first personality trait identified by the media-providing service; based at least in part on the tracked behavior, assigning the first personality trait to the user; and providing, to the user, personalized content associated with the first personality trait assigned to the user.
