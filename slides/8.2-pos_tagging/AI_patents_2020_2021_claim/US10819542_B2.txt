<title>
Apparatus and methods for inducing electromagnetic waves on a cable
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the subject disclosure may include, receiving a communication signal, and generating an electromagnetic wave that propagates along an outer surface of a dielectric layer environmentally formed on a cable. The dielectric layer can be a liquid disposed on an outer surface of the cable that enables the electromagnetic wave to propagate along the dielectric layer of the cable without an electrical return path, and conveys the communication signal. Other embodiments are disclosed.
