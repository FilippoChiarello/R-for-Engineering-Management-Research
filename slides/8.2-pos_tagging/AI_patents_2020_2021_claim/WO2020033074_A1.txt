<title>
AUTOMATED ACCESS CONTROL POLICY GENERATION FOR COMPUTER RESOURCES
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and media are shown for generating access control rules for computer resources involving collecting historical access data for user accesses to a computer resource and separating the historical access data into a training data set and a validation data set. An access control rule is generated for the computer resource based on the properties of the user accesses to the computer resource in the training data set. The rule is validated against the validation data set to determine whether the rule produces a denial rate level is below a threshold when the rule is applied to the validation data set. If the rule is valid, then it is provided to an administrative interface so that an administrator can select the rule for application to incoming user requests.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for generating access control rules for controlling access to computer resources, the method comprising:
collecting historical access data for user accesses to a computer resource;
separating the historical access data into a training data set and a validation data set; generating an access control rule for the computer resource based on one or more properties of the user accesses to the computer resource in the training data set;
validating the access control rule against the validation data set, where the access control rule is determined to be valid if a denial rate level obtained from applying the access control rule to the validation data set is below a threshold parameter value; and
if the access control rule is determined to be valid, providing the access control rule to an administrative interface.
2. The computer-implemented method of Claim 1, where the step of validating the access control rule against the validation data set, where the access control rule is determined to be valid if a denial rate level obtained from applying the access control rule to the validation data set is below a threshold parameter value comprises:
applying the access control rule to user access requests in the validation data set that are directed toward the computer resource to obtain the denial rate level;
comparing the denial rate level to the threshold parameter value; and
determining that the access control rule is valid if the denial rate level is below the threshold parameter value.
3. The computer-implemented method of Claim 1, where the step of validating the access control rule against the validation data set, where the access control rule is determined to be valid if a denial rate level obtained from applying the access control rule to the validation data set is below a threshold parameter value comprises:
applying the access control rule to user access requests in a plurality of subsets of the validation data set that are directed toward the computer resource to obtain a denial rate level for each subset of the plurality of subsets;
scoring the denial rate level for each subset of the plurality of subsets to a corresponding one of a plurality of threshold parameter values to a score for each subset of the plurality of subsets;
collecting the scores for each subset of the plurality of subsets to determine a cumulative score; and
determining that the access control rule is valid if the cumulative score is below a threshold score value.
4. The computer-implemented method of Claim 1, where the threshold parameter value is determined by one or more of a preset value, an algorithmically determined value, and a value received from an administrator.
5. The computer-implemented method of Claim 1, the method further comprising:
receiving a selection message from the administrative interface, the selection message indicating selection of the access control rule; and
responsive to the selection message, storing the access control rule in an access rules store.
6. The computer-implemented method of Claim 5, the method further comprising:
receiving a user access request for the computer resource;
obtaining the access control rule for the computer resource from the access rules store;
applying the access control rule to the received user access request to determine if one or more properties of the received user access request fall within one or more permitted parameters of the access control rule;
permitting the user access request if the one or more properties of the received user access request fall within the one or more permitted parameters of the access control rule; and
rejecting the user access request if the one or more properties of the received user access request do not fall within the one or more permitted parameters of the access control rule.
7. The computer-implemented method of Claim 1, where generating an access control rule for the computer resource based on one or more properties of the user accesses to the computer resource in the training data set further comprises generating the access control rule for the computer resource based on analysis of the one or more properties of the user accesses to the computer resource in the training data set utilizing one or more of machine learning, statistical analysis, Bayesian analysis, histographical analysis, and clustering of user characteristics.
8. An automatic access control policy generation system, the automatic access control policy generation system comprising:
one or more processors; and at least one computer storage medium having computer executable instructions stored thereon which, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to:
collect historical access data for user accesses to a computer resource;
separate the historical access data into a training data set and a validation data set; generate an access control rule for the computer resource based on one or more properties of the user accesses to the computer resource in the training data set;
validate the access control rule against the validation data set, where the access control rule is determined to be valid if a denial rate level obtained from applying the access control rule to the validation data set is below a threshold parameter value; and
