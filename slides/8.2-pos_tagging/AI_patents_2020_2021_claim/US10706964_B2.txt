<title>
Constrained optimization for provider groups
</title>

<abstract>
An optimization system optimizes groups of providers for a given population of users. The optimization system includes various engines such as a source interface engine, selection engine, and group score engine. The source interface engine receives information to be used in constrained optimization from server computers and stores the information in databases. The selection engine selects groups of providers from a set of all available providers. The group score engine generates a score for each group of providers. The selection engine continues to iteratively select groups of providers to minimize the generated score. The selection engine can use hard constraints, for example, requiring that a certain type of provider be included in all selected groups, or soft constraints, for example, requiring that a certain number of providers be included based on a size of the given population.

<claims>
1. A system for constrained optimization of groups of health providers, comprising: a source interface engine configured to receive information from a plurality of server computers and store the information in a database, the information including: user information about the plurality of users, health guidelines including requirements for filling certain health needs of patients or including a medical practice standard and describing one or more constraints to be satisfied for forming a provider group to treat a plurality of health needs of a plurality of users, the one or more constraints including a hard constraint that must be satisfied and a soft constraint that may be satisfied, and provider information describing a plurality of health providers; a selection engine configured to select a plurality of subsets of health providers from the plurality of health providers according to at least one of the hard constraint or the soft constraint, each health provider of each subset capable of treating at least one of the health needs of the plurality of users, the hard constraint requiring a particular type of health provider be included in all subsets of the plurality of subsets, and the soft constraint requiring a particular number of health provider be included based on a size of a user population; a first machine learning model configured to receive input capabilities of each of the plurality of health providers, and output a respective weight for each respective health provider of the plurality of health providers; and a group score engine configured to generate, for each subset of health providers of the plurality of subsets, a score using a second machine learning model trained based on the guidelines, the score indicating a measurement of a capability of the subset of health providers for treating the plurality of health needs, the score being determined at least in part based on the respective weights for each respective health provider in each respective subset of health providers; the selection engine being further configured to determine a candidate subset from the plurality of subsets using the scores.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the candidate subset has the lowest score among all subsets of the plurality of subsets.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the guidelines indicate that a number of health providers of the plurality of health providers capable of treating new users from the plurality of users is greater than a threshold value for the user population.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the guidelines indicate that a number of health providers of the plurality of health providers capable of treating a certain health need of the plurality of health needs is greater than a threshold value for the user population.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the selection engine is further configured to, for each subset of the plurality of subsets: determine, for each of the plurality of health needs: a target number of health providers to treat the health need, a number of health providers of the subset capable of treating the health need, and a ratio of the number of health providers capable of treating the health need to the target number of health providers; wherein the score is based on a sum of each of the ratios and a total number of health providers in the subset.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the group score engine is further configured to: minimize the score for the corresponding subset of health providers based on the sum of the weighted ratios and the total number of health providers in the corresponding subset.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the selection engine is further configured to: compare the scores associated with the plurality of subsets of health providers; and select the subset having the lowest score as the candidate subset of health providers.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the selection engine is further configured to: exchange a selected numbers of health providers included in one subset with another subset of the plurality of subsets; wherein the group score engine is configured to recalculate the scores associated with the plurality of subsets in response to the exchange of the selected number of health providers; and wherein the selection engine is further configured to select a subset as the candidate subset based on the recalculated scores associated with the plurality of subsets.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of health providers includes at least one locked health provider, the at least one locked health provider being initially selected from a set of health providers known to provide high quality health care services, and wherein each subset of health providers includes each of the locked health providers.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the selection engine is further configured to iteratively select pluralities of subsets of health providers from the plurality of health providers and generate scores for each of the subsets until the lowest score of a subset among all subsets reaches a predetermined steady state value.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the selection engine is further configured to determine one or more shortages of health providers of the candidate subset for treating the plurality of health needs based at least in part on the scores.
12. A computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable storage medium having instructions encoded thereon that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: receive patient information describing a plurality of patients; receive health guidelines including requirements for filling certain health needs of patients or including a medical practice standard and describing one or more constraints to be satisfied for forming a provider group to treat health needs of the plurality of patients, the one or more constraints including a hard constraint that must be satisfied and a soft constraint that may be satisfied; identify a patient population based on the patient information and the health guidelines, the identified patient population having a plurality of health needs; receive health provider information describing a plurality of health providers; select a plurality of subsets of health providers from the plurality of health providers according to at least one of the hard constraint or the soft constraint, each provider of each subset capable of treating at least one of the health needs of the identified patient population, the hard constraint requiring a particular type of health provider be included in all subsets of the plurality of subsets, and the soft constraint requiring a particular number of health provider be included based on a size of a user population; input capabilities of each of the plurality of health providers into a first machine learning model; receive, as output from the first machine learning model, a respective weight for each respective health provider of the plurality of health providers; generate, for each subset of health providers of the plurality of subsets, a score using a second machine learning model trained based at least in part on the patient information, the health guidelines, and the health provider information, the score indicating a measurement of a capability of the subset of health providers for treating the plurality of health needs of the identified patient population, the score being determined at least in part based on the respective weights for each respective health provider in each respective subset of health providers; and determine a candidate subset of the plurality of subsets of health providers based at least in part on the scores.
