ESTIMATION METHOD, ESTIMATION APPARATUS, AND COMPUTER-READABLE RECORDING MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium stores therein an estimation program that causes a computer to execute a process including: generating a kernel regression function regarding a movement of a movable object by using interval data that is included in input data regarding the movement of the movable object and that is a specific number of interval data sets selected in accordance with an environmental condition; calculating an objective variable with regard to the environmental condition that is the estimation target based on the kernel regression function; and performing estimating used for an optimization problem regarding the movable object that moves under the environmental condition that is not discontinuous.

<claims>
1. A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium storing therein an estimation program that causes a computer to execute a process comprising: generating a kernel regression function regarding a movement of a movable object by using interval data that is included in input data regarding the movement of the movable object and that is a specific number of interval data sets selected in accordance with an environmental condition; calculating an objective variable with regard to the environmental condition that is the estimation target based on the kernel regression function; and performing estimating used for an optimization problem regarding the movable object that moves under the environmental condition that is not discontinuous.
2. The non-transitory computer-readable recording medium according to claim 1, wherein the generating includes generating the kernel regression function by using the specific number of interval data sets that are selected from the input data regarding the movement of the movable object in ascending order of a Euclidean distance from estimation data indicating the environmental condition that is the estimation target.
3. The non-transitory computer-readable recording medium according to claim 1, wherein the calculating includes calculating a confidence interval of the objective variable based on the kernel regression function generated by using the interval data and an environmental condition of each of the interval data sets.
4. The non-transitory computer-readable recording medium according to claim 3, wherein the calculating includes calculating an objective variable with regard to the environmental condition that is the estimation target based on the kernel regression function generated by using all the input data regarding the movement of the movable object when the confidence interval is equal to or more than a predetermined threshold.
5. The non-transitory computer-readable recording medium according to claim 1, wherein the generating includes using, as the specific number, a number that is previously set such that a difference between an objective variable calculated based on the kernel regression function generated by using the interval data and an objective variable calculated based on the kernel regression function generated by using all the input data regarding the movement of the movable object is equal to or less than a predetermined value.
6. The non-transitory computer-readable recording medium according to claim 1, wherein the generating includes generating the kernel regression function by using the interval data that is selected from input data including at least any of a fluctuation velocity of a medium in an area from the movable object by equal to or less than a predetermined distance, a shape of a medium, and a remaining amount of a power resource of the movable object.
7. An estimation method comprising: generating a kernel regression function regarding a movement of a movable object by using interval data that is included in input data regarding the movement of the movable object and that is a specific number of interval data sets selected in accordance with an environmental condition; calculating an objective variable with regard to the environmental condition that is the estimation target based on the kernel regression function; and performing estimating used for an optimization problem regarding the movable object that moves under the environmental condition that is not discontinuous, by a processor.
