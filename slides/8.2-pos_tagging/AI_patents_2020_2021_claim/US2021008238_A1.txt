SANITIZING WIPE WITH METAL DETECTABLE PRINTED INDICIA
</title>

<abstract>
An article is provided having a substrate with an indicia printed on the substrate, where the indicia is printed with an ink that is detectable by in-line manufacturing production X-ray, metal, or magnetic detectors. A package for multiple such articles is also provided. A process for detecting a sanitizable substrate wipe with magnetic, metal, or X-ray detection equipment in a production setting is also provided. With process implementation article loss in a product can be detected thereby reducing precautionary product discard.

<claims>
1. An article comprising: a substrate; a sanitizing solution absorbed into said substrate; and indicia printed on said substrate, said indicia printed with an ink that is detectable by in-line manufacturing production X-ray, metal, or magnetic detectors.
2. The article of claim 1 wherein said ink is iron rich ink.
3. The article of claim 1 wherein said ink includes at least one of iron, iron oxide, iron nitride, ferritic stainless steel, martensitic stainless steel, aluminum, copper, barium sulfate, or a combination of any of the aforementioned.
4. The article of claim 1 wherein said ink further comprising a binder forming a barrier relative to said sanitizing solution.
5. The article of claim 1 wherein said substrate is formed as a nonwoven material that is spun-laced, melt blown, spunbond, or a composite of two or more of these fiber formations.
6. The article of claim 1 wherein said substrate is comprised of polymer fiber that is one of polypropylene, polyethylene, polybutene, polyisobutylene, a polyamide, a polyacrylate, a polystyrene, a polyurethane, an acetal resin, a polyethylene vinyl alcohol; a polyester, a polyphenylene sulfide, a thermoplastic elastomers, a polyacrylonitrile; a cellulose, a polyaramid, or a block copolymer containing at least one of the aforementioned.
7. The article of claim 1 wherein said binder is an acrylic, a polyurethane acrylate, a styrene acrylic copolymer, a synthetic rubber latex, a butylated melamine formaldehyde resin, or a combination thereof.
8. A package comprising: a plurality of the article of claim 1; and a selectively sealable container that when sealed inhibits a sanitizing solution from evaporating from said container.
9. The package of claim 8 wherein said container is detectable by said in-line manufacturing production X-ray, metal, or magnetic detectors.
10. A process of detecting a fabric article comprising: forming an article of claim 1; passing the article through an in-line X-ray detector, metal, or a magnetic detector in a manufacturing facility; and collecting a signal from said X-ray detector, metal, or said magnetic detector indicative of the presence of the article.
11. The process of detecting the article of claim 10 wherein said article is a wipe.
12. The process of detecting the article of claim 10 wherein said article is at least one of a hair net, apron, sleeve protector, or any other disposable protective equipment.
13. The process of detecting the article of claim 10 wherein said X-ray detector, metal detector, or said magnetic detector is associated with a production line.
14. The process of detecting the article of claim 13 further comprising stopping said production line in response to the signal.
15. The process of detecting the article of claim 14 further comprising shunting product as rejected in response to the signal from said production line.
