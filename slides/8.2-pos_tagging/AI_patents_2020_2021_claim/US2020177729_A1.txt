<title>
Systems and methods for automatically conducting risk assessments for telephony communications
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for using machine-learning techniques for labeling incoming calls with categories relating to a risk level. A model is generated using call log data. The call log data is augmented using information from additional data sources to generate features for the model. The model may then be used to categorize additional incoming calls. The model may be used in real-time to categorize incoming calls, or categorization results may be stored for a plurality of calling numbers. Various embodiments provide various technical advantages by virtue of how the components of the system are deployed between an endpoint communication device, a telephony provider system, and possibly other systems.

<claims>
The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows:
1. A method for automatically conducting risk assessments for telephony communications, the method comprising: receiving, by an endpoint communication device, information representing an incoming call; processing, by the endpoint communication device, the information representing the incoming call using a model for assessing risk of incoming calls to determine a category and a likelihood value for the incoming call, wherein the model for assessing risk of incoming calls was generated based on a set of call log records; and processing, by the endpoint communication device, the incoming call using at least one of the category and the likelihood value.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the model for assessing risk of incoming calls is present on the endpoint communication device.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the model for assessing risk of incoming calls was generated by using the set of call log records to train a naïve Bayes classifier or a decision tree.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving, by the endpoint communication device, the model for assessing risk of incoming calls from a risk assessment system.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising: presenting, by the endpoint communication device, an interface to request feedback regarding the call; and transmitting, by the endpoint communication device, feedback regarding the incoming call to the risk assessment system.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the information representing the incoming call includes a caller phone number.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein processing the incoming call using at least one of the category and the likelihood value includes determining a reputation score that indicates a level of risk based on the category and the likelihood value.
8. An endpoint communication device configured to: receive information representing an incoming call; process the information representing the incoming call using a model for assessing risk of incoming calls to determine a category and a likelihood value for the incoming call, wherein the model for assessing risk of incoming calls was generated based on a set of call log records; and process the incoming call using at least one of the category and the likelihood value.
9. The endpoint communication device of claim 8, wherein the model for assessing risk of incoming calls is present on the endpoint communication device.
10. The endpoint communication device of claim 8, wherein the model for assessing risk of incoming calls was generated by using the set of call log records to train a naïve Bayes classifier or a decision tree.
11. The method of claim 8, further comprising receiving, by the endpoint communication device, the model for assessing risk of incoming calls from a risk assessment system.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising: presenting, by the endpoint communication device, an interface to request feedback regarding the call; and transmitting, by the endpoint communication device, feedback regarding the incoming call to the risk assessment system.
13. The method of claim 8, wherein the information representing the incoming call includes a caller phone number.
14. The method of claim 8, wherein processing the incoming call using at least one of the category and the likelihood value includes determining a reputation score that indicates a level of risk based on the category and the likelihood value.
15. A non-transitory computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions stored thereon that, in response to execution by one or more processors of an endpoint computing device, cause the endpoint computing device to perform actions for automatically conducting risk assessments for telephony communications, the actions comprising: receiving, by the endpoint communication device, information representing an incoming call; processing, by the endpoint communication device, the information representing the incoming call using a model for assessing risk of incoming calls to determine a category and a likelihood value for the incoming call, wherein the model for assessing risk of incoming calls was generated based on a set of call log records; and processing, by the endpoint communication device, the incoming call using at least one of the category and the likelihood value.
16. The computer-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the model for assessing risk of incoming calls is present on the endpoint communication device.
17. The computer-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the model for assessing risk of incoming calls was generated by using the set of call log records to train a naïve Bayes classifier or a decision tree.
18. The computer-readable medium of claim 15, further comprising receiving, by the endpoint communication device, the model for assessing risk of incoming calls from a risk assessment system.
19. The computer-readable medium of claim 18, further comprising: presenting, by the endpoint communication device, an interface to request feedback regarding the call; and transmitting, by the endpoint communication device, feedback regarding the incoming call to the risk assessment system.
20. The computer-readable medium of claim 15, wherein processing the incoming call using at least one of the category and the likelihood value includes determining a reputation score that indicates a level of risk based on the category and the likelihood value.
