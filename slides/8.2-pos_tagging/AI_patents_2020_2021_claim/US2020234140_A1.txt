LEARNING METHOD, AND LEARNING APPARATUS, AND RECORDING MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A learning method executed by a computer, the learning method includes: learning parameters of a machine learning model having intermediate feature values by inputting a plurality of augmented training data, which is generated by augmenting original training data, to the machine learning model so that specific intermediate feature values, which are calculated from specific augmented training data augmented from a same original training data, become similar to each other.
