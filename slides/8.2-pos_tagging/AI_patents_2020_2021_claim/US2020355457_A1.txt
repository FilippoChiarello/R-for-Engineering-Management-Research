WEAPON USAGE MONITORING SYSTEM WITH INTEGRATED CAMERA SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided for weapon systems monitoring and remote support, including application software that receives signals from a plurality of weapons, each weapon including a plurality of sensor types. A connection point may receive signals from the weapons within a deployment location, including sensor information recorded using sensors associated with the weapons and video from at least one camera. The application software may receive the signals from the connection point and process the signals to generate a graphical user interface representing positions and orientations of the weapons within the deployment location, the graphical user interface further presenting video of areas in proximity to each of the firearms, where the application software automatically updates the graphical user interface based on signals indicating changes in the positions and orientations of one or more of the weapons and related video content.

<claims>
1. A system for firearm monitoring and remote support, the system comprising: a server device running application software that receives signals from a plurality of firearms regarding usage thereof, each firearm including a plurality of sensor types; a connection point in communication with the server device that receives signals from the plurality of firearms within a deployment location, the signals including sensor information recorded using sensors of the firearms and video from at least one camera; and a server device running application software that receives the signals from the connection point and processes the signals to generate a graphical user interface representing positions and orientations of the firearms within the deployment location, the graphical user interface further presenting video of areas in proximity to each of the firearms, wherein the application software automatically updates the graphical user interface based on signals indicating changes in the positions and orientations of one or more of the firearms, wherein the updated graphical user interface represents updated video received from the at least one camera.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the sensors include one or more of geolocation sensors, image sensors, or inertial motion sensors.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the video presented in the graphical user interface is initiated based at least in part on measurements recorded using the inertial motion sensors of respective firearms, wherein the measurements indicate a change in orientation of the respective firearms causing activation of cameras in proximity to the firearms.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the change in orientation of a firearm refers to an orientation of the firearm changing from one of a gripping orientation or a drawing orientation to one of a pointing orientation or a firing orientation.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the graphical user interface includes one or more views including a top-down geographic view of the deployment location, wherein the positions and orientations of the firearms are represented within the top-down geographic view.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the one or more views further include one or more of a three-dimensional firearm orientation view, a two-dimensional recoil tracking view, or a user body camera video feed view.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the updated graphical user interface further presents video of a detected threat within the deployment location.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the updated graphical user interface includes visual prompts representing information relating to one or more users of the firearms, the detected threat, or both.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein the updated graphical user interface includes a legend of icons represented within the updated graphical user interface, the icons corresponding to one or more users of the firearms, the detected threat, a video feed from a camera in proximity to the detected threat or each.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the connection point receives some of the signals from wearable devices worn by users of the firearms, wherein the application software uses sensor information included in the signals received from the wearable devices to update the graphical user interface.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the connection point receives some of the signals from robotic devices, wherein the application software uses sensor information included in the signals received from the robotic devices to update the graphical user interface.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein the connection point is one of a plurality of connection points which receives signals used by the application software to generate or update the graphical user interface.
13. The system of claim 1, wherein a size of a cone of fire of a firearm represented within the graphical user interface is based on one or more video feeds from cameras in proximity to the firearm.
14. A method of firearm usage monitoring, the method comprising: communicating with a firearm having a plurality of sensors configured to record information related to usage of the firearm, a communication interface configured to transmit data to a connected device, and a controller operatively coupled to the communication interface and the plurality of sensors; iteratively determining whether an action related to usage of the firearm occurs, wherein the occurrence of the action activates a camera in proximity to the firearm; transmitting video from the camera to a connection point associated with the controller, wherein receipt of the video at the connection point updates a view of a deployment area presented within a graphical user interface.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the action is a pressure applied to a trigger grip.
16. The method of claim 14, wherein the action is a sudden movement of the firearm.
17. The method of claim 14, wherein the action is a discharge of the firearm.
18. The method of claim 14, wherein the camera is a body camera.
19. The method of claim 14, wherein the camera is a surveillance camera.
20. The method of claim 14, wherein the camera is mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle.
