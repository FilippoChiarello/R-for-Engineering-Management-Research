Machine learning apparatus, servo control apparatus, servo control system, and machine learning method
</title>

<abstract>
To perform reinforcement learning enabling to prevent complicated adjustment of coefficients of backlash compensation and backlash acceleration compensation. A machine learning apparatus includes a state information acquiring part for acquiring, from a servo control apparatus, state information including at least position deviation and a set of coefficients to be used by a backlash acceleration compensating part, by making the servo control apparatus execute a predetermined machining program, an action information output part for outputting action information including adjustment information on the set of coefficients included in the state information to the servo control apparatus, a reward output part for outputting a reward value in the reinforcement learning on the basis of the position deviation included in the state information, and a value function updating part for updating an action-value function on the basis of the reward value output by the reward output part, the state information and the action information.
