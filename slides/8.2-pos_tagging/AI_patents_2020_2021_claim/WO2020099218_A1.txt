<abstract>
The invention relates to a device, a system for the device and a set of methods used to extract pulse wave features and select an optimal combination of these features for calculating and determining the blood glucose level and discriminating between different sources of blood glucose level changes in a subject, wherein said different blood glucose level changes are selected among the type of nutrients, type of sport activities, type of stresses and fatigue or a combination thereof. The device and its methods is meant to be used primarily for personal health care diagnosis and home use but can also be used by therapists, trainers and physicians to help them diagnose their patients and follow their patient's progress. The system is designed as a means of accurately obtaining, measuring, registering and interpreting the pulse to determine the blood glucose level of a subject. By collecting pulse wave features, selecting those that are most significant and developing algorithms, the device and its method calculates the user's blood glucose levels and discriminates between different sources of blood glucose level changes of said subject.
