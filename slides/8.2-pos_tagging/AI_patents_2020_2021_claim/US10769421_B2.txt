Method for performing pedestrian detection with aid of light detection and ranging
</title>

<abstract>
A method for performing pedestrian detection with aid of light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is provided. The method includes: obtaining 3-dimensional (3D) point cloud data through the LIDAR; performing ground separation processing on the 3D point cloud data to remove ground information; performing object extraction processing on the 3D point cloud data to obtain 3D point cloud chart that includes pedestrian candidate point cloud group; performing 2-dimensional (2D) mapping processing on the 3D point cloud chart to obtain 2D chart; and extracting 3D feature and 2D feature from the 3D point cloud chart and the 2D chart, respectively, and utilizing the 3D feature and the 2D feature to determine location of the pedestrian. According to the method, image data obtained by the LIDAR may be enhanced, the method may distinguish between pedestrian far away and environment blocks, and pedestrian recognition in nighttime or in bad weather may be improved.

<claims>
1. A method for performing pedestrian detection with aid of light detection and ranging (LIDAR), comprising: obtaining 3-dimensional (3D) point cloud data through the LIDAR; performing ground separation processing on the 3D point cloud data to remove ground information; after the ground information is removed from the 3D point cloud data, performing object extraction processing on the 3D point cloud data to obtain a 3D point cloud chart that comprises a pedestrian candidate point cloud group; performing 2-dimensional (2D) mapping processing on the 3D point cloud chart to obtain a 2D chart, wherein the 2D mapping processing comprises: applying mapping to the 3D point cloud chart to generate the 2D chart; removing noise of the 2D chart by utilizing binary image processing to dilate the 2D chart; removing noise of the 2D chart by utilizing Gaussian blur filtering to blur the 2D chart; utilizing morphology algorithm to obtain contours of respective objects within the 2D chart; and filling up regions of the respective objects within the 2D chart; and extracting a 3D feature and a 2D feature from the 3D point cloud chart and the 2D chart, respectively, and utilizing the 3D feature and the 2D feature to determine a location of the pedestrian.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the 3D point cloud data comprises normalized X, Y, Z coordinates.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the ground separation processing utilizes a Random Sample Consensus to remove the ground information.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the object extraction processing utilizes differences between points within the 3D point cloud data to perform grouping.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein when a difference between two points is less than 0.2 m, the two points are classified into a same group, and the pedestrian candidate point cloud group is determined according to lengths, widths, and heights of respective point cloud groups.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the 2D feature is a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature, a local binary pattern (LBP) feature, a Haar-like feature, or a combination thereof.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein utilizing the 3D feature and the 2D feature to determine the location of the pedestrian comprises: performing classification by utilizing the 3D feature and the 2D feature concurrently with aid of machine learning; and determining the location of the pedestrian according to a classification result.
