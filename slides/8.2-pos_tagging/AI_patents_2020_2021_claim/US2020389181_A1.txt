<title>
Data Compressor Logic Circuit
</title>

<abstract>
A compressor includes a logic circuit having transistors of a first channel type to receive a plurality of bit signals, and transistors of a second channel type, different from the first channel type, to receive the plurality of bit signals. The transistors of the first channel type are configured to generate an XOR logic output based on the plurality of bit signals, and the transistors of the second channel type are configured to generate, substantially simultaneous with the generation of the XOR logic output, an XNOR logic output based on the plurality of bit signals. The compressor includes NAND gates to receive multiplicand and multiplier bit signals.
