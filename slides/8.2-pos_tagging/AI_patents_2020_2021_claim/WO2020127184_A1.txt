MAPPING FOR SOFTWARE COMPLIANCE
</title>

<abstract>
The invention is directed to a method for the identification of similarities and dissimilarities of mappings between the elements of a first model and the elements of a second model, an element being one of: an object, a link, a node, a class, an attribute, an activity, a flow, etc., wherein the method uses data processing means for performing a model mining of the elements of both models in accordance with pre-defined rules and through at least two of the following analyses: a semantic analysis of the elements; a syntactic and/or structural analysis of the elements; a data-based analysis of the elements; and wherein based on these analyses and potentially also based on pre- performed mappings, similarities and dissimilarities mappings between the elements of the first model and the second model are identified and are provided to a user.

<claims>
1. Method for the identification of similarities and dissimilarities of mappings between the elements of a first model (L) and the elements of a second model (S), an element being one of: an object, a link, a node, a class, an attribute, an activity, a flow, etc.,
wherein the method uses data processing means for performing a model mining of the elements of both models in accordance with pre-defined rules, at least one of the pre-defined rules involving at least two of the following analyses:
- a semantic analysis of the elements;
- a syntactic and/or structural analysis of the elements;
- a data-based analysis of the elements;
and wherein based on these analyses and potentially also based on pre-performed mappings, similarities and dissimilarities mappings between the elements of the first model and the second model are identified and are provided to a user.
2. Method according to claim 1 , wherein upon a change of a similarity into a dissimilarity mapping, the method comprises a step of prompting the user, preferably in real-time, with at least one suggestion of a modification of one of the models to reach the satisfaction of selected criteria, preferably to restore the similarity.
3. Method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the step of model mining is performed further on a support model of the first model, a support model of the second model, and/or a support model that is common to both the first and the second model.
4. Method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein one of the models is a computer-implemented model of a legal model related to at least one of: law, regulations or regulatory documents imposed by regulatory bodies, standards, policies, public or private rules.
5. Method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein one of the models is a software model, representing the data structure, the control flow, or the network structure of a software.
6. A computing device comprising a memory element and data processing means, wherein the data processing means have read/write access to at least one database comprising data of a legal model and of a software model, wherein each model is organized with a data structure, wherein the data processing means are further configured for performing the method according to any of claims 1 to 5.
7. A computer program product comprising a computer-readable medium on which a computer program is stored, wherein the program, when run on a computer, causes the computer to carry out the method according to any of claims 1 to 5.
