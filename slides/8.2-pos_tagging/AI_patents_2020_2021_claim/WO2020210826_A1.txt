LEARNING CLASSIFIER FOR BRAIN IMAGING MODALITY RECOGNITION
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for training a model for identifying an imaging modality. The systems and methods can be performed by a computer system having one or more processors and memory. A plurality of image vectors can be generated from first image data using a convolutional neural network. A loss function can be applied to each of the plurality of image vectors to produce an intermediate dataset. The intermediate dataset can be projected in a space having lower dimensional space that the intermediate dataset. A plurality of clusters can be identified from the intermediate dataset in the space using a clustering technique. Each of the plurality of clusters can be classified into one of a plurality of imaging modalities.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method for training a model for identifying an imaging modality from a limited number of training examples, comprising:
generating, from first image data, a plurality of image vectors using a convolutional neural network;
applying a loss function to each of the plurality of image vectors to produce an intermediate dataset;
projecting the intermediate dataset in a space having lower dimensional space that the intermediate dataset;
identifying a plurality of clusters from the intermediate dataset in the space using a clustering technique; and
classifying each of the plurality of clusters into one of a plurality of imaging modalities.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of generating the plurality of image vectors comprises generating, from the first image data, the plurality of image vectors using a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network trained on ImageNet.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
storing a plurality of image data in a database, each of the plurality of image data associated with a respective imaging modality; and
selecting the first image data of the plurality of image data from the database.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of applying the loss function comprises applying a triplet loss function to each of the plurality of image vectors to produce the intermediate dataset.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of projecting the intermediate dataset in the space comprises projecting the intermediate dataset in the space having lower dimensional space that the intermediate dataset using a principle component analysis by performing linear mapping.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of projecting the intermediate dataset in the space comprises projecting the intermediate dataset in the space having lower dimensional space that the intermediate dataset using non-negative matrix factorization by removing negative signals in the intermediate dataset.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
selecting, prior to projecting the intermediate dataset in the space, a dimension of the space having lower dimensional space than the intermediate dataset based on a validation performance metric; and
projecting, using the dimension selected for the space, the intermediate dataset in the space having lower dimensional space that the intermediate dataset.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of identifying the plurality of clusters comprises identifying the plurality of clusters from the intermediate dataset in the space using at least one of a centroid-based, a density -based, a distribution-based, or a hierarchical clustering technique.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of classifying each of the plurality of clusters comprises classifying each of the plurality of clusters into one of the plurality of imaging modalities using a cluster-to-class mapping to assign each of the plurality of clusters to a respective class.
