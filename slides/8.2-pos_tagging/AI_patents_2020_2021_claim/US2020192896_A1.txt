DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for processing data are disclosed. Methods can include receiving a plurality of data resources from one or more data sources and processing one or more of the plurality of data resources to identify a unique data identifier from one of the plurality of data resources. One or more of the plurality of data resources can be processed to identify one or more data records associated with the unique data identifier. A data sequence can be generated, the data sequence can comprise the unique data identifier and the one or more data records associated with that unique data identifier. A plurality of data sequences can be generated, each of the data sequences can comprise a unique data identifier and the one or more data records associated with that unique data identifier. The plurality of data sequences can be processed to generate a plurality of data parameter values and each of the plurality of data parameter values can be linked to a unique data identifier.

<claims>
1. A method of processing data, the method comprising the steps of a) receiving a plurality of data resources from one or more data sources; b) processing one or more of the plurality of data resources to identify a unique data identifier from one of the plurality of data resources; c) processing one or more of the plurality of data resources to identify one or more data records associated with the unique data identifier identified in step b); d) generating a data sequence comprising the unique data identifier and the one or more data records associated with that unique data identifier; e) iterate steps b), c) and d) one or more times to generate a plurality of data sequences, each of the data sequences comprising a unique data identifier and the one or more data records associated with that unique data identifier; and f) processing the plurality of data sequences to generate a plurality of data parameter values wherein each of the plurality of data parameter values are linked to a unique data identifier.
2. A method according to claim 1, wherein the method comprises the further step of allowing a user terminal to access a subset of one or more data parameter values, wherein the one or more data parameter values are associated with the user's performance.
3. A method according to claim 1, where the method comprises the further step of allowing a user terminal to access a subset of one or more data parameter values, wherein the one or more data parameter values are associated with the performance of a group of users.
4. A method according to claim 1, wherein the method comprises the further step of generating a performance measure based on 1 or more data parameter values.
5. A method according to claim 4, wherein the method comprises the step of generating a performance measure relative to the performance of other users.
6. A method according to claim 1, wherein in the step b) the unique data identifier is generated by combining two or more data identifiers.
7. A method according to claim 1, wherein in the step b) the unique data identifier is inferred from two or more other data identifiers.
8. A data carrier device comprising computer executable code for performing a method according to claim 1.
9. A data processing system comprising a processor, random access memory and non-volatile data storage, the system being arranged, in use, to: i) receive a plurality of data resources from one or more data sources; ii) process one or more of the plurality of data resources to identify a unique data identifier from one of the plurality of data resources; iii) process one or more of the plurality of data resources to identify one or more data records associated with the unique data identifier identified in step b); iv) generating a data sequence comprising the unique data identifier and the one or more data records associated with that unique data identifier; v) iterate steps ii), iii) and iv) one or more times to generate a plurality of data sequences, each of the data sequences comprising a unique data identifier and the one or more data records associated with that unique data identifier; vi) processing the plurality of data sequences to generate a plurality of data parameter values wherein each of the plurality of data parameter values are linked to a unique data identifier.
10. A data processing system according to claim 9, wherein the system further comprises a data access module wherein the plurality of data sequences are stored in the data access module.
11. A data processing system according to claim 10, wherein the system, further comprises a network interface, configured such that a user terminal may access one or more of the plurality of data sequences stored in the data access module.
12. A data processing system according to claim 9, wherein the system is instantiated in a cloud computing platform.
