MEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
Provided is a medical image processing apparatus capable of selecting medical images necessary for diagnosis or the like more quickly and accurately than before, in presenting a display list of a plurality of medical images.A medical image processing apparatus (10) includes: a medical image acquisition unit (11) that acquires a medical image including a subject image; a display unit (13) that displays a plurality of the medical images; an abnormal region determination unit (51) that determines an abnormal region by using the medical images; a malignancy discrimination unit (52) that discriminates a degree of malignancy of an abnormality included in the abnormal region; and a display control unit (15) that emphasizes or suppresses display of at least some medical images among the plurality of medical images by using the degree of malignancy, in displaying the plurality of medical images on the display unit.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A medical image processing apparatus comprising: a medical image acquisition unit that acquires a medical image including a subject image; a display unit that displays a plurality of the medical images; an abnormal region determination unit that determines an abnormal region by using the medical images; a malignancy discrimination unit that discriminates a degree of malignancy of an abnormality included in the abnormal region; and a display control unit that emphasizes or suppresses display of at least some medical images among the plurality of medical images by using the degree of malignancy, in displaying the plurality of medical images on the display unit.
2. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 1,
wherein the malignancy discrimination unit discriminates a type of the abnormality or a degree of progress of the abnormality included in the abnormal region, and determines the degree of malignancy by using the type of the abnormality or the degree of progress of the abnormality.
3. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 2, further comprising: a storage unit that stores a correspondence that associates the type of the abnormality or the degree of progress of the abnormality with the degree of malignancy, wherein the malignancy discrimination unit obtains the degree of malignancy from the type of the abnormality or the degree of progress of the abnormality by using the correspondence stored in the storage unit.
4. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 3,
wherein the correspondence is set for each patient or for each doctor.
5. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 3 or 4,
wherein in a case where the correspondence is changed, the storage unit stores the changed correspondence.
6. The medical image processing apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
wherein the display control unit arranges the plurality of medical images in order of the degree of malignancy.
7. The medical image processing apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
wherein the display control unit emphasizes or suppresses display of at least some medical images among the plurality of medical images by adding an emphasis flag to the medical image, adding a character to the medical image, adjusting a display color of the medical image, or adjusting a display size of the medical image.
8. The medical image processing apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 7, further comprising: a same abnormal region determination unit that determines whether or not the plurality of medical images each have the abnormal region including the same abnormality, wherein in a case where there are two or more medical images each having the abnormal region including the same abnormality, the display control unit emphasizes or suppresses display of at least some medical images among the two or more medical images each having the abnormal region including the same abnormality by using the degree of malignancy and an imaging distance of the medical image.
9. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 8,
wherein the display control unit emphasizes or suppresses display of the medical image having a relatively short imaging distance, among the two or more medical images each having the abnormal region including the same abnormality.
10. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 8,
wherein the display control unit emphasizes or suppresses display of the medical image having a relatively long imaging distance, among the two or more medical images each having the abnormal region including the same abnormality.
11. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 8,
wherein the display control unit emphasizes or suppresses the medical image of which the imaging distance is close to a predetermined imaging distance determined for each imaging region in comparison with the other medical images, among the two or more medical images each having the abnormal region including the same abnormality.
12. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 8,
wherein the display control unit preferentially emphasizes display of one or the plurality of medical images of which the imaging distance is relatively close to a reference imaging distance that differs depending on a procedure or suppresses display of one or the plurality of medical images of which the imaging distance is relatively far from the reference imaging distance, among the plurality of medical images.
