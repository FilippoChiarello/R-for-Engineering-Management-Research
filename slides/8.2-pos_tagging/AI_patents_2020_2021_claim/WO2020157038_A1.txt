ONLINE BATTERY STATE OF HEALTH ESTIMATION DURING CHARGING
</title>

<abstract>
According to an example aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for determining the state of health of a battery by monitoring charging of the battery over multiple charging instances. The method is implemented within charging stations by, recognizing the battery via a unique identifier; charging the battery; monitoring conditions of the battery during charging, storing data related to the current charging instance based at least partially on the monitored conditions; retrieving data related to at least one earlier charging instance of the uniquely identified battery; and making a determination of the uniquely identified battery's state of health based at least partially on a comparison of the data related to the current charging instance and the retrieved data related to at least one earlier charging instance.

<claims>
1. A method for determining the state of health of a battery by monitoring charging of said battery over multiple charging instances, comprising a charging station implementing steps of:
- recognizing the battery via a unique identifier;
- charging the battery;
- monitoring conditions of the battery during charging, said conditions including at least one of: a voltage supplied to the battery, a current supplied to the battery and a temperature of the battery;
- storing data related to the current charging instance based at least partially on the monitored conditions;
- retrieving data related to at least one earlier charging instance of the uniquely identified battery; and
- making a determination of the uniquely identified battery's state of health based at least partially on a comparison of the data related to the current charging instance and the retrieved data related to at least one earlier charging instance. 2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the only data used in the determination of the battery's state of health is data gathered during charging of the battery.
3. The method according to any preceding claim, wherein the determination of the battery's state of health is based on data gathered during constant current charging of the battery.
4. The method according any preceding claim, wherein the determination of the battery's state of health is based at least partially on a change in monitored values between at least two monitored charging sessions.
5. The method according to any preceding claim, wherein only data gathered during a constant-current phase of charging is used to make a determination of the battery's state of health.
6. The method according to any preceding claim wherein, the only information required from the battery in making the determination of state of health is the unique identifying information. 7. The method according to any preceding claim further comprising: controlling the charging such that at least one of the monitored parameters is held within a predetermined range during a predetermined time period.
8. The method according to any preceding claim, wherein the determination of the battery's state of health is based at least partially on a change in charge over a predetermined voltage range.
9. The method according to any preceding claim, wherein the determination of the battery's state of health is based at least partially on a change in a charge of the battery over a change in voltage of the battery [dQ/dV]
10. The method according to claim 9, wherein the determination of the battery's state of health is based at least partially on an instantaneous change in a charge of the battery over a change in voltage compared across a range of voltages.
11. The method according to any preceding claim wherein data regarding a previous charging instance is retrieved from a remote location via wired or wireless communication.
12. A battery charging station (400) for determining the state of health of a battery by monitoring charging of a battery (435) over multiple charging instances, comprising power electronics (410) configured to control delivery of electric energy to the battery, and control circuitry (450) connected to the power electronics to cause:
- recognizing the battery (435) via a unique identifier;
- charging the battery (435);
- monitoring conditions of the battery (435) during charging, said conditions including at least one of: a voltage supplied to the battery (435), a current supplied to the battery (435) and a temperature of the battery (435);
- storing data related to the current charging instance based at least partially on the monitored conditions; - retrieving data related to at least one earlier charging instance of the uniquely identified battery (435); and
- making a determination of the uniquely identified battery's state of health based at least partially on a comparison of the data related to the current charging instance and the retrieved data related to at least one earlier charging instance.
13. The charging station 400 of claim 12, further comprising a communication unit 470 configured to communicate with an electric vehicle 405 containing the battery 435.
14. A battery charger comprising at least one processing core, at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code being configured to, with the at least one processing core, cause the battery charger at least to:
- recognize the battery via a unique identifier;
- charge the battery;
- monitor conditions of the battery during charging, said conditions including at least one of: a voltage supplied to the battery, a current supplied to the battery and a temperature of the battery while charging the battery;
- store data related to the current charging instance based at least partially on the monitored conditions;
- retrieve data related to at least one earlier charging instance of the uniquely identified battery; and
- determine a state of health of the uniquely identified battery based at least partially on a comparison of data related to the current charging instance and the retrieved data related to at least one earlier charging instance.
15. A work machine, comprising means configured to perform the method of any preceding claim 1 to 11.
16. The work machine of claim 15, wherein the work machine is a load and/or haul vehicle or a drilling rig for underground worksites.
