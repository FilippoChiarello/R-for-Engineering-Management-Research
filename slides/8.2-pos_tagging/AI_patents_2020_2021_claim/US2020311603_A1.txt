<title>
UTILIZING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS TO PROCESS RESOURCE USAGE DATA AND TO DETERMINE ANOMALOUS USAGE OF RESOURCES
</title>

<abstract>
A device receives historical data associated with multiple cloud computing environments, trains one or more machine learning models, with the historical data, to generate trained machine learning models that generate outputs, and trains a model with the outputs to generate a trained model. The device receives particular data, associated with a cloud computing environment, that includes data identifying usage of resources associated with the cloud computing environment, and processes the particular data, with the trained machine learning models, to generate anomaly scores indicating anomalous usage of the resources associated with the cloud computing environment. The device processes the one or more anomaly scores, with the trained model, to generate a final anomaly score indicating anomalous usage of at least one of the resources associated with the cloud computing environment, and performs one or more actions based on the final anomaly score.
