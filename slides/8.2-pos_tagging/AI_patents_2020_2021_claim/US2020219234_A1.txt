COLLATING SYSTEM, COLLATING METHOD, AND CAMERA DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A camera device communicably connected to a server device includes an imaging unit that images an outdoor monitoring target area, a detection unit that detects an object appearing in a captured image of the imaged monitoring target area and generates a cut-out image of the object, an image correction unit that generates a sharpened image to be used for collating processing of the object in the server device by using the cut-out image of the object and an image correction model, and a communication unit that sends the cut-out image of the object and the sharpened image to the server device in association with identification information of the object.

<claims>
1. A camera device communicably connected to a server device, the camera device comprising: a capturing unit configured to capture an outdoor monitoring target area; a processor configured to detect an object appearing in a captured image of the outdoor monitoring target area, generate a cut-out image of the object, and generate a sharpened image to be used for collating processing of the object performed by the server device based on the cut-out image of the object and an image correction model; and a communicator configured to send the cut-out image of the object and the sharpened image to the server device in association with identification information of the object.
2. A collating system including a camera device and a server device that are communicably connected to each other, wherein the camera device comprises: a capturing unit configured to capture an outdoor monitoring target area; a first processor configured to detect an object appearing in a captured image of the outdoor monitoring target area, generate a cut-out image of the object, and generate a sharpened image based on the cut-out image of the object and an image correction model; and a communicator configured to send the cut-out image of the object and the sharpened image to the server device in association with identification information of the object; wherein the server device comprises: a receiver configured to receive the cut-out image of the object and the sharpened image sent from the camera device, a second processor configured to perform collating processing of the object corresponding to the sharpened image based on the sharpened image and the image correction model; and a transmitter configured to send a result of the collating processing including identification information of the object to an external device.
3. The collating system according to claim 2, wherein the server device has a storage that stores a first image set including an image related to the object, and wherein the second processor generates a sharpened image improving an image quality degradation factor caused by outdoor capturing of the object based on the image related to the object and the image correction model, and adds the generated sharpened image in a second image set stored in the storage.
4. The collating system according to claim 3, wherein the second processor performs the collating processing based on the first image set, the second image set, and the image correction model.
5. The collating system according to claim 3, wherein the first image set includes k (k: an integer of 2 or more) different images related to the object, and wherein the second image set includes k different sharpened images corresponding to the respective images related to the object stored in the first image set stored in the storage.
6. The collating system according to claim 3, wherein the image quality degradation factor is unevenness occurring in a partial region of the object appearing in the captured image due to sunlight, and wherein the second processor generates a pseudo unevenness in a partial region of the image related to the object read from the first image set, generates a sharpened image corresponding to the image having the pseudo unevenness based on the image correction model, and adds the sharpened image in the second image set stored in the storage.
7. The collating system according to claim 3, wherein the image quality degradation factor is a shadow occurring in a partial region of the object appearing in the captured image due to sunlight, and wherein the second processor generates a pseudo shadow in a partial region of the image related to the object read from the first image set, generates a sharpened image corresponding to the image having the pseudo shadow based on the image correction model, and adds the sharpened image in the second image set stored in the storage.
8. The collating system according to claim 3, wherein the image quality degradation factor is low illuminance noise occurring in the object appearing in the captured image due to night capturing, and wherein the second processor generates a pseudo low illuminance noise in an entire image related to the object read from the first image set, generates a sharpened image corresponding to the image having the pseudo low illuminance noise based on the image correction model, and adds the sharpened image in the second image set stored in the storage.
9. The collating system according to claim 3, wherein the image quality degradation factor is white saturation occurring in the object appearing in the captured image due to IR light emitted from an IR illuminator included in the camera device at night, and wherein the second processor generates a pseudo white saturation in an entire image related to the object read from the first image set, generates a sharpened image corresponding to the image having the pseudo white saturation based on the image correction model, and adds the sharpened image in the second image set stored in the storage.
10. The collating system according to claim 2, wherein the server device has a registration database that stores face images of a plurality of suspicious persons in advance, wherein in a case where the second processor extracts a face image that corresponds with the sharpened image used in the collating processing, the second processor sends, to the external device, the collating processing result in which the extracted face image and the cut-out image of the object are associated with the identification information of the object.
11. The collating system according to claim 5, wherein the server device performs learning processing for generating k different sharpened images corresponding to the respective images related to the object included in the first image set before starting actual operation of the collating system.
12. The collating system according to claim 5, wherein the server device performs learning processing for generating k different sharpened images corresponding to the respective images related to the object included in the first image set during actual operation of the collating system.
13. The collating system according to claim 12, wherein the communicator sends parameters related to capturing processing performed at the time of generating the cut-out image of the object, the sharpened image, and the captured image to the server device in association with identification information of the object, and wherein the second processor stores the parameters sent from the camera device in association with the sharpened image and executes the learning processing based on the parameters.
14. A collating method implemented by a collating system including a camera device and a server device that are communicably connected to each other, the collating method comprising: detecting, by the camera device, an object appearing in a captured image based on capturing of an outdoor monitoring target area and generating a cut-out image of the object, generating, by the camera device, a sharpened image to be used for collating processing of the object performed by the server device based on the cut-out image of the object and an image correction model, and sending, by the camera device, the cut-out image of the object and the sharpened image to the server device in association with identification information of the object, and receiving, by the server device, the cut-out image of the object and the sharpened image sent from the camera device, performing, by the server device, collating processing of the object corresponding to the sharpened image based on the sharpened image and the image correction model, and sending, by the server device, a result of the collating processing including identification information of the object to an external device.
