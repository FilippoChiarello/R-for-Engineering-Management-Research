PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEMS WITH LOCALIZATION-BASED INTENT DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and techniques for a physical access control systems with localization-based intent detection are described herein. In an example, an access control system may regulate access to an asset. The access control system is adapted to receive a credential of a user from a key device associated with the user using a first wireless connection. The access control system may be further adapted to establish a second wireless connection with the key device. The access control system may be further adapted to determine the user intends to access the asset based on a data set generated derived from the second wireless connection. The access control system may be further adapted to use a trained machine learning model to determine the intent of the user to access the asset. The access control system may be further adapted to transmit a command to grant access to the asset.

<claims>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method for regulating access to an asset, comprising: receiving a credential of a user from a key device associated with the user using a first wireless connection;
establishing a second wireless connection with the key device;
determining the user intends to access the asset based on a data set generated derived from the second wireless connection; and
transmitting a command to grant access to the asset.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first wireless connection is Bluetooth Low Energy and the second wireless connection is Ultra-Wideband.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein determining the user intends to access the asset further comprises:
determining a probability the user intends to access the asset using the data set and a trained machine learning model, wherein the trained machine learning model is trained with data sets collected from a plurality of users; and
determining the probability exceeds a predetermined threshold.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the data sets include movement data for the plurality of users within a range of the asset.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the data sets include a time of day timestamp and wherein the data set of the user is timestamped.
6. The method of claim 3, wherein the data sets include movement data from the plurality of users and wherein the key device provides movement data from an accelerometer of the key device.
7. The method of any preceding claim, wherein determining the user intends to access the asset includes using data received from a calendar system.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising:
identifying an event in the calendar system associated with the asset; and identifying an indication of attendance to the event by the user.
9. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the asset is a physical location.
10. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the asset is an electronic device.
11. A system for regulating access to an asset, comprising:
at least one processor; and
memory including instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to:
receive a credential of a user from a key device associated with the user using a first wireless connection;
establish a second wireless connection with the key device;
determine the user intends to access the asset based on a data set generated derived from the second wireless connection; and
transmit a command to grant access to the asset.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the first wireless connection is Bluetooth Low Energy and the second wireless connection is Ultra-Wideband.
13. The system of claim 11 or 12, wherein determining the user intends to access the asset further comprises instructions to:
determine a probability the user intends to access the asset using the data set and a trained machine learning model, wherein the trained machine learning model is trained with data sets collected from a plurality of users; and
determine the probability exceeds a predetermined threshold.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the data sets include movement data for the plurality of users within a range of the asset.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the data sets include a time of day timestamp and wherein the data set of the user is timestamped.
16. The system of claim 13, wherein the data sets include movement data from the plurality of users and wherein the key device provides movement data from an accelerometer of the key device.
17. The system of any of claims 11 to 16, wherein determining the user intends to access the asset includes using data received from a calendar system.
18. The system of claim 17, further comprising instructions to:
identify an event in the calendar system associated with the asset; and identify an indication of attendance to the event by the user.
19. The system of any of claims 11 to 18, wherein the asset is a physical location.
20. The system of any of claims 11 to 19, wherein the asset is an electronic device.
