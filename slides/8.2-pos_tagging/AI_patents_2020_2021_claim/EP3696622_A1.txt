<title>
AI EXTENSIONS AND INTELLIGENT MODEL VALIDATION FOR AN INDUSTRIAL DIGITAL TWIN
</title>

<abstract>
Industrial smart data tags conforming to structured data types serve as the basis for creating a digital twin of an industrial asset. The digital twin can comprise an automation model and a mechanical model or other type of non-automation model, both of which reference the smart tags in connection with digitally modeling the industrial asset. The structured data topology offered by the smart tags allows the digital twin to be readily interfaced with artificial intelligence (AI) systems. AI analysis can leverage the smart tags to discover new relationships between key performance indicators and other variables of the asset and encode these relationships in the smart tags themselves. These enhanced smart tags can also be leveraged to perform Al-based validation the digital twin. Additional contextualization provided by the enhanced smart tags can simplify AI analysis and assist in quickly converging on desired analytic results.
