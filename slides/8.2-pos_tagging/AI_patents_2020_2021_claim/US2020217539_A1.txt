SMART TRANSDUCER PLUG AND PLAY CONTROL SYSTEM AND METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A building management system includes a communications bus, field devices connected to the communications bus, a cloud service including a machine learning engine; and a controller for an HVAC device. The controller communicates with the communications bus and the cloud service and is configured to transmit messages through the communications bus to the field devices, compile a list of connected field devices, receive sample data from the connected field devices, and transmit the sample data from the connected field devices to the cloud service. The controller is further configured to receive identifying characteristics for each of the connected field devices from the cloud service and to select a control logic file for the HVAC device based on the identifying characteristics.

<claims>
1. A controller for an HVAC device of a building management system comprising a communications bus, a plurality of field devices connected to the communications bus; and a cloud service comprising a machine learning engine, the controller comprising: an interface configured to be communicably connected to the communications bus; and a processor configured to: transmit messages through the communications bus to the plurality of field devices connected to the communications bus; compile a list of the field devices connected to the communications bus; receive sample data from the field devices; transmit the sample data from the field devices to the cloud service; and receive at least one identifying characteristic for each of the field devices from the cloud service.
2. The controller of claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to select a control logic file for the HVAC device based at least in part on the identifying characteristic.
3. The controller of claim 1, wherein the plurality of field devices includes at least one temperature sensor, pressure sensor, or humidity sensor and wherein the sample data comprises at least one of temperature data, pressure data, and humidity data.
4. The controller of claim 1, wherein the plurality of field devices communicate with the controller via an IEEE 1451.4 TEDS standard.
5. The controller of claim 1, wherein the identifying characteristic comprises field device location within the building management system.
6. The controller of claim 1, wherein the HVAC device is at least one of a fan coil unit, a roof top unit, and an air handling unit.
7. The controller of claim 1, wherein the controller communicated with the cloud service via wireless communications.
8. The controller of claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to modulate an operation of at least one of a cooling coil and a heating coil in response to a message from the cloud service.
9. The controller of claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to modulate an operation of a fan in response to a message from the cloud service.
10. A method of operating a machine learning engine for a building management system, the method comprising: designing a sequence of operational steps for a plurality of heating ventilating, or air conditioning (HVAC) devices connected to a communications bus of the building management system; designing a description algorithm for data received from a plurality of field devices connected to the communications bus, and classifying location data patterns for the plurality of field devices.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the description algorithm comprises a plurality of primitive data shapes.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the location data patterns comprise at least one operational step and at least one primitive data shape.
13. The method of claim 12 wherein the plurality of field devices includes at least one temperature sensor, pressure sensor, or humidity sensor, and the data includes at least one of temperature data, pressure data, and humidity data.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein the HVAC devices comprise at least one of a fan coil unit, a roof top unit, and an air handling unit.
15. The method of claim 10, wherein the machine learning engine is part of a cloud service.
16. The method of claim 10, wherein the method further comprises: modulating an operation of at least one of a cooling coil and a heating coil; and modulating an operation of a fan.
17. A method of operating a building management system comprising a communications bus and a plurality of field devices connected to the communications bus, the method comprising: providing command data to the field devices from a cloud-based control system; receiving sample data from the field devices at the cloud-based control system; and classifying the field devices based upon the command data and the sample data, wherein the classifying comprises using location data.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the sample data includes at least one of temperature data, pressure data, and humidity data.
19. The method of claim 17, wherein the cloud service comprises a machine learning engine.
20. The method of claim 17, further comprising: modulating an operation of at least one of a cooling coil and a heating coil; and modulating an operation of a fan.
