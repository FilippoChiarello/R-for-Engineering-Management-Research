<title>
Bambam: parallel comparative analysis of high-throughput sequencing data
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to methods for evaluating and/or predicting the outcome of a clinical condition, such as cancer, metastasis, AIDS, autism, Alzheimer's, and/or Parkinson's disorder. The methods can also be used to monitor and track changes in a patient's DNA and/or RNA during and following a clinical treatment regime. The methods may also be used to evaluate protein and/or metabolite levels that correlate with such clinical conditions. The methods are also of use to ascertain the probability outcome for a patient's particular prognosis.

<claims>
1. A computer-based genomic sequence analysis system comprising: a database storing at least two genomic sequence datasets including: a tumor sequence dataset comprising genomic sequence strings of a tumor tissue sample of a patient; and a matched normal dataset comprising genomic sequence strings of a normal tissue sample of the patient; and a sequence analysis engine coupled with the database and configured to: simultaneously and synchronously read, into a device memory, genomic reads of a tumor sequence string from the tumor sequence dataset and genomic reads of a matched normal sequence string from the matched normal dataset; wherein the tumor sequence string is incrementally synchronized with the matched normal sequence string by reading respective sets of genomic reads, into the device memory from both the tumor sequence string and the matched normal sequence string, that overlap a given genomic position, for each of a plurality of genomic positions; identify a genomic alteration associated with the given genomic position according to a probability derived from comparing the genomic reads of the tumor sequence string to the matched normal sequence string that overlap the given genomic position; store the genomic alteration in the device memory; and discard, from the device memory, the respective sets of genomic reads that overlap the given genomic position, and subsequently simultaneously and synchronously read, into the device memory, genomic reads of the tumor sequence string and genomic reads of the matched normal sequence string that overlap another genomic position, wherein the tumor sequence string and the matched normal sequence string represent at least 10% of a genome of the patient.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the genomic alteration comprises a genomic variant of a plurality of genomic variants in the tumor tissue sample.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the genomic variant comprises a somatic variant.
4. The system of claim 2, wherein the genomic variant comprises a germline variant.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the genomic alteration comprises a single nucleotide polymorphism.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the genomic alteration comprises an alteration selected from the group consisting of: an allele-specific copy number, a loss of heterozygosity, a structural rearrangement, a chromosomal fusion, and a breakpoint.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the tumor sequence dataset comprises a tumor BAM file.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the matched normal dataset comprises a normal BAM file.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least two genomic sequence datasets comprise more than two genomic sequence datasets.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the more than two genomic sequence datasets comprise related sequencing datasets.
11. The system of claim 9, wherein the more than two genomic sequence datasets include at least one relapse dataset.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein the sequence analysis engine is further configured to simultaneously read and synchronize a third dataset with the tumor sequence dataset and the matched normal dataset.
13. The system of claim 1, further comprising a genome browser configured to display the genomic alteration in relation to the tumor sequence dataset and the matched normal dataset.
14. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is configured to store the at least two genomic sequence datasets as files within a file system.
15. The system of claim 1 wherein identification of the genomic alteration uses pile-ups of the genomic reads that overlap every common genomic location between the tumor sequence string and the matched normal sequence string.
16. The system of claim 1 wherein the plurality of genomic positions for the tumor sequence string and the matched normal sequence string are based on a reference genome.
17. The system of claim 1 wherein the probability is determined by maximizing a joint likelihood of both tumor and germline genotypes.
18. The system of claim 17 wherein maximizing the joint likelihood includes deriving a probability from patient data as defined by:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?P(Dg,Dt,Gg,Gt|α,r)=P(Dg|Gg)P(Gg|r)P(Dt|Gg,Gt,α)P(Gt|Gg)description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"? where r is an observed reference allele, a is a fraction of normal contamination, where the tumor and germline genotypes are defined by Gt=(t1,t2) and Gg=(g1,g2), where t1, t2, g1,g2 ϵ{A, T, C, G}, and where tumor and germline sequence data are defined as a set of reads Dt={dt1, dt2, . . . , dtm}, and Dg={dg1, dg2, . . . , dgn}, respectively, with observed bases dti,dgiϵ{A,T,C,G}.
19. The system of claim 18 wherein a probability of germline alleles given a germline genotype is modeled as a multinomial over four nucleotides: where n is a total number of germline reads at the given genomic position and nA, nG, nC, nt are reads supporting each observed allele, and a probability of tumor alleles given a tumor genotype is modeled as a multinomial over four nucleotides: where n is a total number of tumor reads at the given genomic position and nA, nG, nC, nt are patient data reads supporting each observed allele.
