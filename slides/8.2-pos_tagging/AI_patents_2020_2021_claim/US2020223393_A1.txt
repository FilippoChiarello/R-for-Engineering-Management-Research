METHOD OF PROCESSING AMBIENT RADIO FREQUENCY DATA FOR ACTIVITY RECOGNITION
</title>

<abstract>
A method of operating an activity recognition system includes capturing ambient radio frequency (RF) data by an RF sniffer. The ambient RF data is then received by a processor. The processor reduces noise content of the ambient RF data. Background is then subtracted from the ambient RF data by the processor. The processed ambient RF data is then converted into an image by the processor. The system generates successive images for each one of a plurality of time intervals. An image processing algorithm, stored in a storage medium and executed by the processor, is applied to the plurality of successive images to determine activity recognition.
