Inter-vehicle communication system, vehicle system, vehicle illumination system and vehicle
</title>

<abstract>
An inter-vehicle communication system includes: a first vehicle including a message generator configured to generate a message and a first wireless communication unit configured to wirelessly transmit the generated message; a second vehicle including a second wireless communication unit configured to receive the message transmitted from the first vehicle; and a display device that is located in the second vehicle and is configured to display the message.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An inter-vehicle communication system, comprising: a first vehicle comprising a message generator configured to generate a message and a first wireless communication unit configured to wirelessly transmit the generated message; a second vehicle comprising a second wireless communication unit configured to receive the message transmitted from the first vehicle; a display device that is located in the second vehicle and is configured to display the message; a first illumination unit of the first vehicle that emits light toward an outside of the first vehicle; and a first illumination controller of the first vehicle that, when the message is wirelessly transmitted, change an illumination feature of the first illumination unit.
2. The inter-vehicle communication system according to claim 1, wherein the display device is provided at a predetermined place in the second vehicle, or is carried or worn by an occupant in the second vehicle.
3. The inter-vehicle communication system according to claim 2, wherein the display device is a head-up display (HUD) provided at the predetermined place in the second vehicle.
4. The inter-vehicle communication system according to claim 1, wherein the first vehicle further comprises: a second illumination unit configured to emit light toward an outside of the first vehicle, thereby forming a predetermined light pattern; and a second illumination controller configured to, when the message is wirelessly transmitted, control the second illumination unit so that the predetermined light pattern is to be presented on a road surface toward the second vehicle.
5. A vehicle system provided for a vehicle capable of traveling in an autonomous driving mode, the vehicle system comprising: a message generator configured to generate a message that is to be displayed on a display device located in another vehicle outside the vehicle; a wireless communication unit configured to wirelessly transmit the generated message; a first illumination unit that emits light toward an outside of the first vehicle; and a first illumination controller that, when the generated message is wirelessly transmitted, change an illumination feature of the first illumination unit.
6. A vehicle illumination system provided for a vehicle capable of traveling in an autonomous driving mode, the vehicle illumination system comprising: a third illumination unit configured to emit laser light toward an outside of the vehicle; and a third illumination controller configured to cause the third illumination unit to irradiate the laser light to a front glass of another vehicle outside the vehicle, thereby displaying a message on the front glass.
7. A vehicle comprising the vehicle illumination system according to claim 6 and capable of traveling in an autonomous driving mode.
