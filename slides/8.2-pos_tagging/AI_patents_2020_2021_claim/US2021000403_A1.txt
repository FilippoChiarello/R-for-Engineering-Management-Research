STRESS DETECTION METHOD AND TERMINAL
</title>

<abstract>
This application provides a stress detection method and a terminal, and relates to the field of terminal technologies, to resolve a problem of relatively low reliability of data collected during stress detection. The method includes: obtaining an event of a terminal, determining a stress measurement time based on the event of the terminal, and detecting stress of a user based on the time. The event is at least one of a schedule, a reminder, and a running application program. This application is applicable to a stress detection process.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A stress detection method, comprising: obtaining an event of a terminal, wherein the event is at least one of a schedule, a reminder, or a running application program; determining a stress measurement time based on the event of the terminal; and detecting stress of a user based on the stress measurement time.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the event is at least one of the schedule or the reminder, and the determining the stress measurement time based on the event of the terminal, and detecting stress of the user based on the stress measurement time comprises: determining, based on the schedule or the reminder, whether stress is caused to the user; and if the schedule or the reminder causes stress to the user, detecting the stress of the user at a time point or in a time period in an occurrence process of an event in the schedule or an event in the reminder.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the event is the running application program, and the determining the stress measurement time based on the event of the terminal, and the detecting stress of the user based on the stress measurement time comprises: determining whether the running application program belongs to a first application list, wherein the first application list comprises a list of application programs that affect the stress of the user; if the running application program belongs to the first application list and a running time of the running application program exceeds a preset time, determining whether a current heart rate of the user exceeds a resting heart rate; and detecting the stress of the user at a time point or in a time period after the current heart rate of the user exceeds the resting heart rate.
4. 4-7 (canceled)
8. A terminal, comprising: a processor configured to obtain an event of the terminal, wherein the event is at least one of a schedule, a reminder, or a running application program, wherein the processor is configured to determine a stress measurement time based on the event of the terminal; and a sensor configured to detect stress of a user based on the stress measurement time.
9. The terminal according to claim 8, wherein the event is at least one of the schedule or the reminder, and the processor is further configured to: determine, based on the schedule or the reminder, whether stress is caused to the user; and if the schedule or the reminder causes stress to the user, control the sensor to detect the stress of the user at a time point or in a time period in an occurrence process of an event in the schedule or an event in the reminder.
10. The terminal according to claim 8, wherein the event is the running application program; and the processor is further configured to: determine whether the running application program belongs to a first application list, wherein the first application list comprises a list of application programs that affect the stress of the user; if the running application program belongs to the first application list and a running time of the running application program exceeds a preset time, determine whether a current heart rate of the user exceeds a resting heart rate; and control the sensor to detect the stress of the user at a time point or in a time period after the current heart rate of the user exceeds the resting heart rate.
11. A terminal, comprising: a sensor configured to detect a status of a user; and a processor configured to determine a stress measurement time based on the status of the user that is detected by the sensor. wherein the sensor is configured to detect stress of the user based on the stress measurement time.
12. The terminal according to claim 11, wherein the sensor comprises at least one of a heart rate sensor or a motion sensor; the heart rate sensor is configured to detect that the user is in a sleep state, and the motion sensor is configured to detect that the user is in the sleep state; the heart rate sensor is further configured to detect a physiological signal of the user; the processor is further configured to determine, based on the physiological signal, whether the user is in a waking state; the heart rate sensor is further configured to: when the user is in the waking state, obtain a heart rate of the user; the processor is further configured to determine, based on the heart rate of the user, whether the user is in a stable state; and the sensor is further configured to detect the stress of the user at a first preset time after the user is in the stable state.
13. The terminal according to claim 11, wherein the sensor comprises at least one of a heart rate sensor or a motion sensor; the heart rate sensor is configured to detect that the user is in a moving state, and the motion sensor is configured to detect that the user is in the moving state; the motion sensor is further configured to detect motion signal information of the user; the processor is further configured to determine, based on the motion signal information, whether the user is in a stable state; the processor is further configured to: when the user is in the stable state for a preset time threshold, determine whether a current heart rate of the user is close to a resting heart rate; and the sensor is further configured to detect the stress of the user at a second preset time after the current heart rate of the user is close to the resting heart rate.
14. The terminal according to claim 11, wherein the sensor comprises a motion sensor; the motion sensor is configured to detect motion signal information of the user; the processor is further configured to: when the motion signal information is less than a preset threshold, determine that the user is in a stable state; the processor is further configured to: when it is determined that the user is in the stable state for a preset time threshold, determine whether a current heart rate of the user is close to a resting heart rate; and the sensor is further configured to detect the stress of the user at a third preset time after the current heart rate of the user is close to the resting heart rate.
