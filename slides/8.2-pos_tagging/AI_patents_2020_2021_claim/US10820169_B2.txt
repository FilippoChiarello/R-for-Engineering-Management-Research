<title>
Methods and systems for social networking with autonomous mobile agents
</title>

<abstract>
Exemplary methods and systems are presented for social networking applications using autonomous mobile agents. Communication links are established based on geographic proximity and distance described as a domain in which resident agents are detected and identified. The communication links thus established allow platform independent communication along communication channels that are dynamically derived. Incorporation of computer machines and feature data sets (including attractiveness data) permit agent classification and inter-agent notification of classification results.

<claims>
1. A method to establish a group of autonomous agents, comprising the steps of: defining a set of proximity parameters which describe a domain; detecting and identifying a group of two or more agents as members of said domain, wherein each such agent is associated with a respective user computational device; notifying one or more of said agents of said detected and identified group; transmitting agent feature data associated with one or more of said agents in said group to one or more of other said agents in said group, and classifying one or more agents in said group depending on said transmitted agent feature data; and communicating said classifications to one or more of said agents in said group, wherein said step of notifying said agents of said detected and identified group comprises a notification of the presence of said one or more of said agents within said domain, wherein said proximity parameters comprise geometric proximity parameters, and wherein one of said agents is designated as a parent agent, wherein said geometric proximity parameters comprise proximity with respect to said parent agent, and wherein said detecting comprises determining whether one or more agents in said group are members of said domain.
2. A method to establish a group of autonomous agents, comprising the steps of: defining a set of proximity parameters which describe a domain; detecting and identifying a group of two or more agents as members of said domain, wherein each such agent is associated with a respective user computational device; notifying one or more of said agents of said detected and identified group; transmitting agent feature data associated with one or more of said agents in said group to one or more of other said agents in said group, and classifying one or more agents in said group depending on said transmitted agent feature data; and communicating said classifications to one or more of said agents in said group, wherein said step of notifying said agents of said detected and identified group comprises a notification of the presence of said one or more of said agents within said domain, wherein said proximity parameters comprise geometric proximity parameters, wherein said detecting comprises point-to-point communication between two of said agents, and wherein one of said agents is designated as a parent agent, wherein said geometric proximity parameters comprise proximity with respect to said parent agent, and wherein said detecting comprises determining whether one or more agents in said group are members of said domain.
3. A method to establish a group of autonomous agents, comprising the steps of: defining a set of proximity parameters which describe a domain; detecting and identifying a group of two or more agents as members of said domain, wherein each such agent is associated with a respective user computational device; notifying one or more of said agents of said detected and identified group; transmitting agent feature data associated with one or more of said agents in said group to one or more of other said agents in said group, and classifying one or more agents in said group depending on said transmitted agent feature data; and communicating said classifications to one or more of said agents in said group, wherein said step of notifying said agents of said detected and identified group comprises a notification of the presence of said one or more of said agents within said domain, wherein said proximity parameters comprise geometric proximity parameters, and wherein one of said agents is designated as a parent agent, wherein said parent agent's location is not fixed, and wherein said detected and identified group consists of a subgroup of said agents that are within a specified geographical proximity to said parent agent's location.
