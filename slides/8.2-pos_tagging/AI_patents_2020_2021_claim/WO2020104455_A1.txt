</title>

<abstract>
The invention provides for a method of training a neural network (322) configured for providing a further processing location (326). The method comprises providing (200) a labeled medical image (100), wherein the labeled medical image comprises multiple labels each indicating a truth processing location (102, 104, 106). The method further comprises inputting (202) the labeled medical image into the neural network to obtain one trial processing location. The one trial processing location comprises a most likely trial processing location (108). The method further comprises determine (204) the closest truth processing location (106) for the most likely trial processing location. The method further comprises calculating (206) an error vector (110) using the closest truth processing location and the most likely trial processing location. The method further comprises training (208) the neural network using the error vector.
