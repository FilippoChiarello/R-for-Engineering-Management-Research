DETECTING, ASSESSING AND MANAGING A RISK OF DEATH IN EPILEPSY
</title>

<abstract>
A method for determining and responding in real-time to an increased risk of death relating to a patient with epilepsy is provided. The method includes receiving cardiac data and determining a cardiac index based upon the cardiac data. The method includes determining an increased risk of death associated with epilepsy if the indices are extreme, issuing a warning of the increased risk of death and logging information related to the increased risk of death. Also presented is a second method for determining and responding in real-time to an increased risk of death relating to a patient with epilepsy comprising receiving at least one of arousal data, responsiveness data or awareness data and determining an arousal index, a responsiveness index or an awareness index, where the indices are based on arousal data, responsiveness data or awareness data respectively. The second method includes determining an increased risk of death related to epilepsy if indices are extreme values, issuing a warning of the increased risk of death and logging information related to the increased risk of death. A computer readable program storage device is also provided. Also provided is a method for receiving body data, determining a cardiac, an arousal, a responsiveness, or a kinetic index, determining an increased or increasing risk of death over a first time window relating to a patient with epilepsy and issuing a warning and logging relevant information.
