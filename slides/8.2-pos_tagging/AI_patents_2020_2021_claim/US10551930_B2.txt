<title>
System and method for executing a process using accelerometer signals
</title>

<abstract>
Apparatus and process for controlling a computer process with gestures and a handheld pointing device. The computer system employing the pointing device to determine what component a user wants to control and what control action is desired.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of controlling an object, the method comprising: receiving orientation signals from one or more accelerometers based on use of a three-dimensional pointing device by a user, wherein the one or more accelerometers are contained in the three-dimensional pointing device; normalizing the received orientation signals based in part on previously determined calibration factors, the previously determined calibration factors being associated with a profile of the user of the three-dimensional pointing device; computing a three dimensional location of the three-dimensional pointing device based on the received orientation signals and the normalized signals; determining an object at which the three-dimensional pointing device is being pointed; and controlling an action of the object based on signals received from the three-dimensional pointing device and based on the profile associated with the user of the three-dimensional pointing device, the profile including at least one user command associated with a respective at least one three-dimensional movement of the three-dimensional pointing device.
2. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: detecting movement of the three-dimensional pointing device; recognizing a gesture associated with the detected movement of the three-dimensional pointing device three-dimensional pointing device; and performing the action based on the recognized gesture.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein the action comprises issuing one or more commands, wherein the issued one or more commands are based on the recognized gesture.
4. The method according to claim 2, wherein performing the action comprises issuing one or more commands controlling one or more application programs running on one or more computers.
5. The method according to claim 4, wherein controlling one or more application programs includes controlling connected devices of the one or more computers on which the one or more applications are running.
6. The method according to claim 4, wherein the recognized gesture comprises one of a set of gestures based on the one or more application programs running on the one or more computers.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein the object is an icon displayed on a computer screen; and controlling the object consists of activating the icon to perform one or more functions.
8. The method according to claim 1, wherein the object is a cursor displayed on a computer screen; and controlling the object comprises moving the cursor on the computer screen.
9. The method according to claim 8, further comprising: detecting activation of a button on the three-dimensional pointing device; wherein the action controlled is further based on the location of the cursor on the computer screen and the button activated.
10. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: detecting activation of a button on the three-dimensional pointing device, wherein the action is initiated upon detecting activation of the button.
11. The method according to claim 1, wherein controlling the action comprises controlling one or more home appliances.
12. The method according to claim 1, wherein controlling one or more appliances is initiated by one or more of: activating a button or switch on the three-dimensional pointing device; pointing the three-dimensional pointing device at the one or more appliances; performing a certain gesture with the three-dimensional pointing device; and rolling the three-dimensional pointing device around the object.
13. The method according to claim 1, wherein controlling the action comprises controlling a video game.
14. The method according to claim 1, wherein the three dimensional location comprises a volume space; and wherein the method further comprises: tracking the object as being either within the volume space or outside the volume space; and controlling the action only if the object is within the volume space.
15. The method according to claim 14, wherein the three-dimensional pointing device is configured to control any device within the volume space.
16. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: selecting one or more referent to be controlled by the action; and initiating control actions on the one or more referent based on movement of the three-dimensional pointing device, wherein the particular referent being controlled is based on the movement of the three-dimensional pointing device.
17. A system comprising: a processor and a memory communicatively coupled to the process, the memory storing thereon computer-executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the system to perform operations comprising: receiving orientation signals from one or more accelerometers based on use of a three-dimensional pointing device by a user, wherein the one or more accelerometers are contained in the three-dimensional pointing device; normalizing the received orientation signals based in part on previously determined calibration factors, the previously determined calibration factors being associated with a profile of the user of the three-dimensional pointing device; computing a three dimensional location of the three-dimensional pointing device based on the received orientation signals and the normalized signals; determining an object at which the three-dimensional pointing device is being pointed; and controlling an action of the object based on signals received from the three-dimensional pointing device and based on the profile associated with the user of the three-dimensional pointing device, the profile including at least one user command associated with a respective at least one three-dimensional movement of the three-dimensional pointing device.
18. A computer-readable storage device storing thereon computer-executable instructions that, when executed by a processor of a computing device, cause the computing device to perform operations comprising: receiving orientation signals from one or more accelerometers based on use of a three-dimensional pointing device by a user, wherein the one or more accelerometers are contained in the three-dimensional pointing device; normalizing the received orientation signals based in part on previously determined calibration factors, the previously determined calibration factors being associated with a profile of the user of the three-dimensional pointing device; computing a three dimensional location of the three-dimensional pointing device based on the received orientation signals and the normalized signals; determining an object at which the three-dimensional pointing device is being pointed; and controlling an action of the object based on signals received from the three-dimensional pointing device and based on the profile associated with the user of the three-dimensional pointing device, the profile including at least one user command associated with a respective at least one three-dimensional movement of the three-dimensional pointing device.
