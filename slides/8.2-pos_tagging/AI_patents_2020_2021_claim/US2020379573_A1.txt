INFORMATION PROCESSING APPARATUS, INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided an information processing apparatus including a signal generation unit, a first determination unit, and a second determination unit. The signal generation unit processes an output of a sensor unit attached to a detection target, and generates a trigger signal at a time when a state change of the detection target is detected. The first determination unit is brought out of hibernation and activated when receiving the trigger signal, determines the state change of the detection target from the output of the sensor unit by a first determination criterion, and outputs a determination impossibility signal in a case where the determination is impossible. The second determination unit is brought out of hibernation and activated when receiving the determination impossibility signal, and determines the state change of the detection target from the output of the sensor unit by a second determination criterion different from the first determination criterion.

<claims>
1. An information processing apparatus, comprising: a signal generation unit that processes an output of a sensor unit attached to a detection target, and generates a trigger signal at a time when a state change of the detection target is detected; a first determination unit that is brought out of hibernation and activated when receiving the trigger signal, determines the state change of the detection target from the output of the sensor unit by a first determination criterion, and outputs a determination impossibility signal in a case where the determination is impossible; and a second determination unit that is brought out of hibernation and activated when receiving the determination impossibility signal, and determines the state change of the detection target from the output of the sensor unit by a second determination criterion different from the first determination criterion.
2. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the signal generation unit detects a motion of a user who wears the detection target from the state change of the detection target, and the first determination unit and the second determination unit determine, on a basis of a mode of the motion of the user, whether a corresponding gesture candidate exists or not from among a plurality of gesture candidates set in advance.
3. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the first determination unit executes a first determination process of specifying a gesture candidate corresponding to the mode of the motion of the user from among the plurality of gesture candidates, and outputs the determination impossibility signal in a case where specifying the gesture candidate is impossible.
4. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the second determination unit executes a second determination process of specifying a gesture candidate having a highest correlation with the mode of the motion of the user from among the plurality of gesture candidates.
5. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, further comprising: a setting unit that sets the plurality of gesture candidates, wherein the signal generation unit changes a standard by which the trigger signal is generated in accordance with a kind of the plurality of gesture candidates set.
6. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the signal generation unit detects a motion of an arm of the user who wears the detection target, and the first determination unit and the second determination unit each specify any one of a raising operation, a lowering operation, a twisting operation, and a shaking operation of the arm of the user.
7. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the first determination unit and the second determination unit are brought into hibernation again after the state change of the detection target is determined.
8. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a buffer memory capable of chronologically storing the output of the sensor unit.
9. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the signal generation unit generates the trigger signal at a time when a state change relating to a posture of the detection target.
10. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the second determination unit involves power consumption higher than that of the first determination unit.
11. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a casing for storing the signal generation unit, the first determination unit, and the second determination unit, wherein the casing is capable of being attached to the detection target.
12. An information processing method, comprising: bringing out of hibernation and activating a first determination unit which determines a state change of a detection target by a first determination criterion, when the state change of the detection target is detected on a basis of an output of a sensor unit attached to the detection target; and bringing out of hibernation and activating a second determination unit which determines the state change of the detection target by a second determination criterion different from the first determination criterion, when the first determination unit is incapable of performing determination.
13. A program causing a computer to execute the steps of: bringing out of hibernation and activating a first determination unit which determines a state change of a detection target by a first determination criterion, when the state change of the detection target is detected on a basis of an output of a sensor unit attached to the detection target; and bringing out of hibernation and activating a second determination unit which determines the state change of the detection target by a second determination criterion different from the first determination criterion, when the first determination unit is incapable of performing determination.
