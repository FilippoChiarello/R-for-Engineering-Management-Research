</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a kit for detecting and implementing rice blight resistance based on variation in SWEET promoters, comprising (1) (i) PCR primers for amplifying SWEET11a, SWEET13, and SWEET14 cDNA; and/or (ii) rice promoter reporter lines for SWEET11 a, SWEET13, and SWEET14 accumulation; (2) rice knock out lines for SWEET11 a, SWEET13, and SWEET14 genes; and (3) tester rice lines genome-edited in the SWEET11 a, SWEET13, and/or SWEET14 promoter region for evaluating the efficacy of the respective mutation for resistance. Furthermore, the invention relates to a method for detecting and implementing rice blight resistance and to specific rice lines, which comprise at least one genome-edited SWEET promoter sequence.
