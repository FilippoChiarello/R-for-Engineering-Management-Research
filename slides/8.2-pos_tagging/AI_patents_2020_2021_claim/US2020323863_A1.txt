<title>
ANTICANCER TREATMENT FOR UVEAL MELANOMA
</title>

<abstract>
Provided herein are methods for treating uveal melanoma in a subject in need thereof by administering an effective amount of an agent that inhibits expression of FAK protein to the subject. In one aspect, the agent that inhibits expression of FAK protein comprises, or alternatively consists essentially of, or yet further consists of a gene editing agent, such as for example one or more of: RNA interference (RNAi), CRISPR/Cas, ZFN, and/or TALEN. In another aspect, the agent is VS-4718. Also described herein are kits comprising, or alternatively consisting essentially of, or yet further consisting of one or more of: agents that inhibit expression of FAK protein, siRNAs, shRNAs, miRNAs, nucleases and/or guide RNA sequences for carrying out the methods of this disclosure, and optional instructions for use.

<claims>
1. A method for treating primary or metastatic uveal melanoma in a subject in need thereof comprising administering an effective amount of an agent that inhibits expression of FAK protein to the subject.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the agent that inhibits expression of FAK protein comprises a gene editing agent.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the agent is VS-4718.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the agent is one or more of: VS-4718, GSK2256098, NVP-TAC544, PF 573,228, TAE226, VS-6062, VS-6063, 1H-Pyrrolo(2,3-b)pyridine, Y15, chloropyramine hydrochloride or R2 Y11.
5. The method of claim Error! Reference source not found., wherein gene editing agent comprises using one or more of: RNA interference (RNAi), CRISPR/Cas, ZFN, or TALEN.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject is a mammal.
7. The method of claim Error! Reference source not found., wherein the subject is a human.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the administration is one or more of: oral, topical, transdermal, intranasal, vaginal, rectal, subcutaneous intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intraosseous, intraperitoneal, epidural and intrathecal.
9. A kit comprising one or more of: agents that inhibit expression of FAK protein, siRNAs, shRNAs, miRNAs, nucleases and guide RNA sequences for carrying out the method of claim 1, and optional instructions for use.
10. A method for treating primary or metastatic uveal melanoma (UM) in a subject in need thereof comprising administering an effective amount of a first agent that inhibits focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and a second agent that inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) to the subject.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the first agent is one or more of: PF-562271, VS-4718, GSK2256098, NVP-TAC544, PF 573,228, TAE226, VS-6062, VS-6063, 1H-Pyrrolo(2,3-b)pyridine, Y15 (1,2,4,5-benzenetetraamine tetrahydrochloride), chloropyramine hydrochloride, R2 Y11, PF-562,271, NVP-226, PND-1186, or GSK2256098.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein the UM of the subject has one or more of: a deficient GTPase, a constitutively active Gαq protein, an increased expression of Yes-Associated Protein (YAP), a nuclear-localized YAP, an increased phosphorylation of YAP at Y357, a decreased phosphorylation of YAP at S127, a reduced expression of BAP1, or an increased expression of FAK protein.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein the second agent is one or more of: selumetinib, trametinib, cobimetinib, CH5126766, Binimetinib, AZD-8330, PD-325901, CI-1040, PD035901 or TAK-733.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein the first agent is VS-4718 and the second agent is trametinib or CH5126766.
15. The method of claim 10, wherein the first agent is VS-6063 and the second agent is CH5126766.
16. The method of claim 10, wherein the first agent is neither VS-6063 nor GSK2256098.
17. A method for selecting a subject having primary or metastatic uveal melanoma (UM) or suspected of having uveal melanoma for therapy, comprising detecting a biological sample from the subject having one or more of the following: a deficient GTPase, a constitutively active Gαq protein, an increased expression of Yes-Associated Protein (YAP), a nuclear-localized YAP, an increased phosphorylation of YAP at Y357, a decreased phosphorylation of YAP at S127 and an increased expression of FAK protein.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the therapy comprises administration of an effective amount of a first agent that inhibits focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the subject and a second agent that inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK).
19. The method of claim 17, further comprising administering an effective amount of a first agent that inhibits focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the subject and a second agent that inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK).
20. The method of claim 19, wherein the first agent is VS-4718 and the second agent is trametinib or CH5126766.
21. A composition for treating primary or metastatic uveal melanoma (UM) in a subject comprising a first agent that inhibits focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and a second agent that inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK).
22. The composition of claim 21, wherein the first agent is one or more of: PF-562271, VS-4718, GSK2256098, NVP-TAC544, PF 573,228, TAE226, VS-6062, VS-6063, 1H-Pyrrolo(2,3-b)pyridine, Y15 (1,2,4,5-benzenetetraamine tetrahydrochloride), chloropyramine hydrochloride, R2 Y11, PF-562,271, NVP-226, PND-1186, or GSK2256098.
23. The composition of claim 21, wherein the second agent is one or more of: selumetinib, trametinib, cobimetinib, CH5126766, Binimetinib, AZD-8330, PD-325901, CI-1040, PD035901 or TAK-733.
