System, Method, and Computer Program for Analyzing Operation of Fluid Control Device
</title>

<abstract>
A fluid control device 8 and a server 72 are configured to be able to communicate with each other through networks NW1 and 2. The fluid control device 8 includes an operation information acquisition mechanism that acquires a plurality of types of operation information about the fluid control device 8. The server 72 includes a determination processing unit 721 that determines whether the fluid control device 8 has an abnormality, an information collection unit 724 that collects the operation information and an abnormality determination result for the fluid control device 1, an information storage unit 725 that stores the operation information and the determination result collected, an information extraction unit 726 that refers to the information storage unit 725, and extracts, analysis target including same predetermined operation information and another of the operation information as well as information related to the determination result, selectively for each of a plurality of the fluid control devices 1, and a correlation analysis unit 727 that analyzes correlation between a predetermined operation of the fluid control device 8 and occurrence of abnormality through comparison using the information extracted.
