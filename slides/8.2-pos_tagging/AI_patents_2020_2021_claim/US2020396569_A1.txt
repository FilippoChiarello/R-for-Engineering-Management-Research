APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR SHARING CONTENT
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides an apparatus and method for sharing content. A method provided in the present disclosure comprises receiving a message to request to join a content sharing group from a second device while a third device included in the content sharing group transmits first content shared in the content sharing group to a fourth device included in the content sharing group, adding the second device to the content sharing group, and permitting the second device to access the first content.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for sharing content in a first device, the method comprising: receiving a message to request to join a content sharing group from a second device while a third device included in the content sharing group transmits first content shared in the content sharing group to a fourth device included in the content sharing group; adding the second device to the content sharing group; and permitting the second device to access the first content.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the third device receives a content download request from a fifth device included in the content sharing group, and wherein the third device permits the fifth device to download the first content while the fourth device downloads the first content.
3. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the third devices receives, from one of devices included in the content sharing group except for the third device, a message indicating selection of second content desired to be shared in the content sharing group, determines whether the second content is permitted to be shared in the content sharing group, and wherein the third device provides a notification indicating the determined result to the one of devices included in the content sharing group except for the third device.
4. The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the second content is shared between the third device and the one of devices included in the content sharing group except for the third device.
5. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein a bandwidth of an ongoing content transmission session is upscaled based on one or more factors, wherein the ongoing content transmission session is used for transmitting the first content from the third device to the fourth device, and wherein the one or more factors comprises at least one of: a current ampere factor; a battery factor; a device temperature factor; a file size factor; a device core count factor; a priority request sending factor; a minimum factor; a storage factor; or a file transfer speed feedback.
6. The method as claimed in claim 5, wherein the upscaling of the bandwidth is performed according to request of at least one of the third device and the fourth device.
7. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein an access to network data is provided from the third device to the fourth device while the third device transmits the first content to the fourth device based on at least one of: an application requesting the access to the network data; device information associated with the fourth device seeking the access to the network data; a user-input; or a predefined data limit.
8. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein content history is displayed on the third device, and the content history includes information about content transmitted by the third device, wherein a selection of content to be transmitted to the fourth device is detected by the third device, and the selection is performed based on the content history, and wherein the selected content is transmitted from the third device to the fourth device.
9. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising: detecting a message to request to change a host from the first device to the third device; and transferring one or more control rights of the content sharing group to the third device.
10. A method for sharing content in a third device, the method comprising: detecting a selection of first content desired to be shared in the content sharing group from a user of a third computing device while a first device included in the content sharing group transmits first content shared in the content sharing group to a second device included in the content sharing group; determining whether to share the first content in the content sharing group; and sharing the first content in the content sharing group upon determining to share the first content in the content sharing group.
11. The method as claimed in claim 10, further comprising: providing a notification indicating the determined result, wherein the determining whether to share the first content in the content sharing group comprising: determining whether the first content is permitted to be shared in the content shared group.
12. The method as claimed in claim 10, further comprising: receiving information associated with second content to be downloaded; updating a list of contents based on the information; and receiving a notification indicating presence of the second content in the list of contents associated with one or more devices included in the content sharing group except for the third device.
13. The method as claimed in claim 12, further comprising: downloading a segment of the second content; and sharing the segment of the second content with the one or more devices included in the content sharing group except for the third device.
14. The method as claimed in claim 12, further comprising: receiving one or more segments of the second content from the one or more devices included in the content sharing group except for the third device; and merging the one or more segments of the second content.
15. A device for sharing content configured to perform one of the methods of claim 1.
