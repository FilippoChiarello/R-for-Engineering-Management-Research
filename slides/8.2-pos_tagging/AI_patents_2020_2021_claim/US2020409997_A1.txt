METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING SAME CONTENTS ON THE BASIS OF COMMENTS BY TIME
</title>

<abstract>
A method of determining equality between contents according to an embodiment of the present invention includes: reading, by a comment information management unit, comment information on a first video content from a database; reading, by the comment information management unit, comment information on a second video content from the database; and determining, by a comment information comparison unit, equality between the first video content and the second video content by comparing the comment information on the first video content and the comment information on the second video content.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of determining equality between contents, the method comprising: reading, by a comment information management unit, comment information on a first video content from a database; reading, by the comment information management unit, comment information on a second video content from the database; and determining, by a comment information comparison unit, equality between the first video content and the second video content by comparing the comment information on the first video content and the comment information on the second video content.
2. The method according to claim 1, further comprising reflecting, by the comment information management unit, the comment information on the first video content in the comment information on the second video content and recording the comment information on the second video content in the database, when it is determined that the first video content and the second video content are equal to each other.
3. The method according to claim 2, further comprising: reading, by the comment information management unit, comment information on a third video content from the database, and determining, by the comment information comparison unit, equality between the second video content and the third video content by comparing the comment information on the second video content and the comment information on the third video content, before reflecting the comment information on the first video content in the comment information on the second video content; and determining again, by the comment information comparison unit, when it is determined that the second video content and the third video content are inequal, equality between the second video content and the third video content by comparing again the comment information on the second video content and the comment information on the third video content, after reflecting the comment information on the first video content in the comment information on the second video content.
4. The method according to claim 2, wherein the comment information management unit reflects only information on comments having high frequency or reliability among the comment information on the first video content in the comment information on the second video content and records the comment information on the second video content in the database.
5. The method according to claim 1, further comprising automatically creating and recording, by a comment information creation unit, the comment information on the second video content in the database on the basis of the second video content, when the comment information on the second video content is not in the database.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein determining equality includes determining equality between a time section of the first video content and a time section of the second video content.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein determining equality includes determining equality on the basis of similarity between contents of comments and similarity between mapping times of the comments.
8. The method according to claim 7, wherein determining equality includes determining similarity between contents of the comments considering different languages.
9. The method according to claim 7, wherein determining equality includes determining similarity between mapping times of the comments considering movement on a time axis.
10. The method according to claim 7, wherein determining equality includes determining similarity between mapping times of the comments considering expansion/contraction on a time axis.
11. The method according to claim 7, wherein determining equality includes determining equality on the basis of frequencies of the comments.
12. The method according to claim 7, wherein determining equality includes determining equality on the basis of reliability of the comments.
13. The method according to claim 7, wherein determining equality includes determining equality on the basis of information on users who inputted the comments.
14. The method according to claim 7, wherein determining equality includes determining equality on the basis of information on input situations of the comments.
15. The method according to claim 1, wherein determining equality includes: visualizing and outputting the comment information on the first video content and the comment information on the second video content according to mapping times of comments; and receiving information on the equality between the first video content and the second video content from a user.
16. The method according to claim 15, wherein visualizing and outputting the comment information includes visualizing and outputting the comment information in different methods according to at least one criterion among types of the comment, frequencies of the comments, reliability of the comments, information on users who inputted the comments, and information on input situations of the comments.
17. A system for determining equality between contents, the system comprising: a comment information management unit for reading comment information on a first video content and comment information on a second video content from a database; and a comment information comparison unit for determining equality between the first video content and the second video content by comparing the comment information on the first video content and the comment information on the second video content.
18. A computer-readable recording medium for storing a program which executes the method according to claim 1.
