<title>
System and a method for assessing patient risk using open data and clinician input
</title>

<abstract>
A system for assessing patient risk using open data and input of knowledge data, the system including a healthcare knowledge data input to receive open data and a knowledge input to accept input of knowledge data relating to risk; a healthcare risk engine to provide a healthcare risk knowledge graph from the open data and knowledge data by using input of risk-related terms to retrieve documents from the open data and by extracting the healthcare risk knowledge graph as entities from the documents corresponding to risk-related terms, as well as links between the entities. A patient risk graph prediction module predicts risks for a patient by combining information in a Patient Clinical Object (PCO) with entities in the healthcare risk knowledge graph to produce a patient risk graph.

<claims>
1. A system, comprising: a healthcare knowledge data input interface to interface with databases of open data and a databases of knowledge data in form of risk-related terms relating to a risk; at least one processor to cause the system to implement: a healthcare risk engine to generate a healthcare risk knowledge graph represented in form of linked data nodes in at least one memory from the databases of open data by retrieving documents from the databases of open data using the risk-related terms, and extracting data nodes from the linked data nodes that store entities from the documents corresponding to the risk-related terms and forming links between the extracted data nodes to link the entities; and a patient risk graph prediction module to combine information in a Patient Clinical Object (PCO) graph obtained from a historical clinical data graph represented in the at least one memory in form of linked data nodes centered on a specific patient, with the entities in the healthcare risk knowledge graph to generate a specific patient risk graph to represent a predicted risk for the specific patient in form of linked data nodes in the at least one memory by, matching an item of information from the linked data nodes in the PCO graph with a corresponding entity in the linked data nodes in the healthcare risk knowledge graph, and forming a data node corresponding to the matched item from the PCO graph to be linked around a data node storing the corresponding entity in the healthcare risk knowledge graph, to form the specific patient risk graph; and a graphical user interface to display a visual graph representation of the data nodes of the specific patient risk graph to display information indicating the specific patient risks and links between the specific patient risks.
2. A system according to claim 1, wherein the PCO graph is an aggregation of clinical entities that encapsulates items of information about the specific patient, and wherein the PCO graph contains the historical clinical information with information about the specific patient linked to the specific patient by categories including any one or combination of categories of diagnosis, symptom, treatment, hospital visit and prescription.
3. A system according to claim 1, wherein the risk-related terms include terms related to risks in form of potential diseases, terms related to risk factors that increase the likelihood of disease and terms related to treatments of a medical condition.
4. A system according to claim 1, wherein the healthcare risk engine comprises: a risk related terms collector to accept input of the risk-related terms; a medical entity reconciliator, to standardise and expand the risk-related terms to include synonyms and equivalent terms using a standardised vocabulary of terms; a topic detector and tagger, to retrieve a set of documents linked to the expanded terms from a medical document database; a named entity recognition, resolution and disambiguation (NERD) module to extract entities from the documents, each document among the documents with a score and each aligned to the standardised vocabulary; and a relation extractor to score relations between the entities based on co-occurrence of two entities in the documents in the retrieved documents; wherein the healthcare risks extraction system is arranged to generate a risk knowledge graph storing the entities and the scored relations of the entities.
5. A system according to claim 1, wherein the patient risk graph prediction module is a meta-predictor to perform the matching and which is arranged to use the PCO graph in two or more of predictors to produce corresponding respective specific patient risk subgraphs from the healthcare risk knowledge graph, the two or more predictors including: a diagnosis-based predictor to provide a specific patient risk subgraph based on previous diagnoses, a drug-based predictor to provide a specific patient risk subgraph based on previous drugs taken by the patient, a symptom-based predictor to provide a specific patient risk subgraph based on previous symptoms of the patient, and a treatment-based predictor to provide a specific patient risk subgraph based on treatments the patient is receiving; and wherein meta predictor is to indicate predictions by organizing and processing the corresponding respective specific patient risk subgraphs produced by the two or more predictors into the specific patient risk graph.
6. A system according to claim 5, wherein each patient risk subgraph among the patient risk subgraphs constructed by a predictor among the predictors includes any entities in the healthcare risk knowledge graph which match an item of information, one or more entities which neighbor the matching entities and the entities on a shortest path between the matching entities.
7. A system according to claim 6, wherein each predictor among the predictors is given a weighting based on an accuracy of performance measure, and wherein the weighting is used to determine a maximum number of entities in a corresponding patient risk subgraph which is retained in the specific patient risk graph.
8. A system according to claim 1, wherein each entity in the healthcare risk knowledge graph and the specific patient risk graph includes a score to reflect how closely the entity corresponds to the risk-related term.
9. A system according to claim 5, wherein the meta predictor checks the entities included by the predictors and selects entities which are present in a highest number of predictors and/or has a highest cumulative score as the specific patient risk graph.
10. A system according to claim 1, further comprising a translation module to accept a risk-related term in one language and translate the risk-related term into an equivalent in a language of a standardised vocabulary.
11. A computer-implemented method to display information indicating risks for a specific patient risks and links between the specific patient risks, the method comprising: by at least one processor, generating a healthcare risk knowledge graph represented in form of linked data nodes in at least one memory from databases of open data by retrieving documents from databases of open data using risk-related terms from knowledge databases, and extracting data nodes from the linked data nodes that store entities from the documents corresponding to the risk-related terms and forming links between the extracted data nodes to link the entities; and combining information in a Patient Clinical Object (PCO) graph obtained from a historical clinical data graph represented in the at least one memory in form of linked data nodes centered on a specific patient, with the entities in the healthcare risk knowledge graph to generate a specific patient risk graph to represent a predicted risk for the specific patient in form of linked data nodes in the at least one memory by, matching an item of information from the linked data nodes in the PCO graph with a corresponding entity in the linked data nodes in the healthcare risk knowledge graph, and forming a data node corresponding to the matched item from the PCO graph to be linked nodes around a data node storing the corresponding entity in the healthcare risk knowledge graph, to form the specific patient risk graph; and displaying, through a graphical user interface, a visual graph representation of the data odes of the specific patient risk graph to display information indicating the specific patient risks and links between the specific patient risks.
12.
