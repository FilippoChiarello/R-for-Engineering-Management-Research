MULTI DOMAIN REAL-TIME QUESTION ANSWERING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A system (1000) for automated question answering, including: semantic space (210) generated from a corpus of questions and answers; a user interface (1030) configured to receive a question; and a processor (1100) comprising: (i) a question decomposition engine (1050) configured to decompose the question into a domain, a keyword, and a focus word; (ii) a question similarity generator (1060) configured to identify one or more questions in a semantic space using the decomposed question; (iii) an answer extraction and ranking engine (1080) configured to: extract, from the semantic space, answers associated with the one or more identified questions; and identify one or more of the extracted answers as a best answer; and (iv) an answer tuning engine (1090) configured to fine-tune the identified best answer using one or more of the domain, keyword, and focus word; wherein the fine-tuned answer is provided to the user via the user interface.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system for automated question answering, the system comprising: a semantic space generated from a corpus of questions and answers; a user interface configured to receive a question from a user; and a processor comprising the following: a question decomposition engine configured to decompose the received question into at least one domain, one keyword, and one focus word; a question similarity generator configured to identify one or more questions in the semantic space using the decomposed question, wherein the identified one or more questions are determined to be similar to the received question; an answer extraction and ranking engine configured to: (i) extract, from the semantic space, answers associated with the one or more identified questions; (ii) identify one or more of the extracted answers as a best answer; and an answer tuning engine configured to fine-tune the identified best answer using one or more of the at least one domain, one keyword, and one focus word; wherein the fine-tuned answer is provided to the user via the user interface.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising a corpus of questions and answers, wherein at least some of the questions are associated with a respective answer.
3. The system of claim 1, further comprising a pre-processing engine configured to preprocess the received question, comprising one or more of extracting text from the received question, segmenting a sentence of the received question, and correcting a spelling of the received question.
4. The system of claim 1, further comprising a semantic space database configured to store the semantic space.
5. The system of claim 1, further comprising a syntactic and semantic relatedness engine configured to rank the one or more identified questions based on similarity to the received question.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the questions in the semantic space comprise a vector, and wherein the decomposed question comprises a vector, and further wherein the vectors of the questions in the semantic space are compared to the vector of the decomposed question, and wherein a question in the semantic space is identified as being similar if the vector comparison is above a predetermined threshold.
7. A computerized method for automated question answering, the method comprising the steps of: providing an automated question answering system k4A44 comprising a user interface, a processor, and a generated semantic space; receiving, via the user interface, a question from a user for which is answer is requested; decomposing, by the processor, the received question into at least one domain, one keyword, and one focus word; identifying, by the processor, one or more questions in the generated semantic space using the decomposed question, wherein the identified one or more questions are determined to be similar to the received question; ranking, by the processor, the one or more identified questions based on similarity to the received question; extracting, by the processor from the semantic space, answers associated with the one or more identified questions; identifying, by the processor, one or more of the extracted answers as a best answer; fine-tuning, by the processor, the identified best answer using one or more of the at least one domain, one keyword, and one focus word; and providing, via the user interface, the fine-tuned best answer as an answer to the received question.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising the step of generating a semantic space from a corpus of questions and answers, wherein at least some of the questions are associated with a respective answer.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the generated semantic space is stored in a database.
10. The method of claim 7, wherein the questions in the semantic space comprise a vector, and wherein the decomposed question comprises a vector, and further wherein the vectors of the questions in the semantic space are compared to the vector of the decomposed question, and wherein a question in the semantic space is identified as being similar if the vector comparison is above a predetermined threshold.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the predetermined threshold comprises a cosine value.
12. The method of claim 7, further comprising the step of preprocessing, by the processor, the received question, comprising one or more of extracting text from the received question, segmenting a sentence of the received question, and correcting a spelling of the received question.
13. The method of claim 7, wherein the step of ranking the one or more identified questions based on similarity to the received question comprises a semantic and/or syntactic analysis of the identified questions.
14. The method of claim 7, wherein the step of identifying one or more of the extracted answers as a best answer comprises a ranking of the extracted answers.
15. The method of claim 7, wherein the system further includes a pre-trained question domain classifier 43, and wherein the received question is decomposed based at least in part by the pre-trained question domain classifier.
