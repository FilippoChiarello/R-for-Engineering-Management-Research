AROUSAL STATE ESTIMATION APPARATUS AND AROUSAL STATE ESTIMATION METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An arousal state estimation apparatus includes: a feature value acquisition unit acquiring a plurality of types of feature values regarding an arousal state of a human body from physiological data obtained by measuring the human body; and an estimation unit estimating the arousal state of the human body by using a principal feature value that is some type among the plurality of types of feature values. In a case where the principal feature value is unacquirable due to a defect of the physiological data, the estimation unit estimates the arousal state of the human body by using a different type of feature value than the principal feature value among the plurality of types of feature values acquired by the feature value acquisition unit instead of the unacquirable principal feature value.

<claims>
1. An arousal state estimation apparatus comprising: a feature value acquisition unit acquiring a plurality of types of feature values regarding an arousal state of a human body from physiological data obtained by measuring the human body; and an estimation unit estimating the arousal state of the human body by using a principal feature value that is some type among the plurality of types of feature values, wherein, in a case where the principal feature value is unacquirable due to a defect of the physiological data, the estimation unit estimates the arousal state of the human body by using a different type of feature value than the principal feature value among the plurality of types of feature values acquired by the feature value acquisition unit instead of the unacquirable principal feature value.
2. The arousal state estimation apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the estimation unit uses a type of feature value having a high correlation with the unacquirable principal feature value instead of the unacquirable principal feature value.
3. The arousal state estimation apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the physiological data includes a measurement result of a heart, respiration, a fingertip pulse, a skin resistance, blinking, a pupil, or head movement.
4. The arousal state estimation apparatus according to claim 1, wherein, in a case where there is a defect in the physiological data, the feature amount acquisition unit supplements the physiological data at a timing related to the defect based on the physiological data obtained at another timing.
5. An arousal state estimation method comprising: acquiring a plurality of types of feature values regarding an arousal state of a human body from physiological data obtained by measuring the human body; estimating the arousal state of the human body by using a principal feature value that is some type among the plurality of types of feature values; and estimating, in a case where the principal feature value is unacquirable due to a defect of the physiological data, the arousal state of the human body by using a different type of feature value than the principal feature value among the plurality of types of acquired feature values instead of the unacquirable principal feature value.
6. The arousal state estimation apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the physiological data includes a measurement result of a heart, respiration, a fingertip pulse, a skin resistance, blinking, a pupil, or head movement.
7. The arousal state estimation apparatus according to claim 2, wherein, in a case where there is a defect in the physiological data, the feature amount acquisition unit supplements the physiological data obtained at a timing related to the defect based on the physiological data obtained at another timing.
8. The arousal state estimation apparatus according to claim 6, wherein, in a case where there is a defect in the physiological data, the feature amount acquisition unit supplements the physiological data obtained at a timing related to the defect based on the physiological data obtained at another timing.
