VEHICLE TRAILER WITH SELECTIVELY POWERED WHEELS, ENERGY RECOVERY, AND/OR PARASITIC CHARGING
</title>

<abstract>
A trailer can be configured to selectively provide powered wheels, energy recovery, and/or parasitic power source charging. A trailer-related trigger (drive activation trigger, an energy recovery trigger, or a parasitic charging trigger) can be detected. When a drive activation trigger is detected, one or more motors can be activated to power one or more wheels of the trailer, thereby providing extra pushing power. When an energy recovery trigger is detected, one or more power sources of the trailer can be charged by recovering energy from the trailer. When a parasitic charging trigger is detected, one or more power sources of the trailer can be charged using a portion of the power generated by a main vehicle operatively connected to the trailer.

<claims>
1. A trailer comprising: one or more power sources; one or more motors operatively connected to receive electrical energy from the one or more power sources; one or more wheels, the one or more wheels being operatively connected to the one or more motors for selectively powering the one or more wheels; one or more processors operatively connected to the one or more motors, the one or more processors being configured to: detect a trailer-related trigger, the trailer-related trigger being one of a drive activation trigger, an energy recovery trigger, or a parasitic charging trigger; responsive to detecting a drive activation trigger, activate the one or more motors to power the one or more wheels; responsive to detecting an energy recovery trigger, cause the one or more power sources to be charged by recovering energy from the trailer; or responsive to detecting a parasitic charging trigger, cause the one or more power sources to be charged using power generated by a main vehicle operatively connected to the trailer.
2. The trailer of claim 1, wherein the one or more power sources includes one or more batteries.
3. The trailer of claim 1, wherein the one or more power sources includes one or more supercapacitors.
4. The trailer of claim 1, wherein the one or more wheels includes at least one pair of wheels.
5. The trailer of claim 4, wherein the at least one pair of wheels includes a rearmost pair of wheels.
6. The trailer of claim 1, further including one or more sensors, wherein the one or more sensors are operatively connected to the one or more processors, the one or more processors being configured to detect at least one of a drive activation trigger, an energy recovery trigger, and a parasitic charging trigger based on data acquired by the one or more sensors.
7. The trailer of claim 1, further including one or more input interfaces, wherein the one or more input interfaces are operatively connected to the one or more processors, the one or more processors being configured to detect at least one of a drive activation trigger, an energy recovery trigger, and a parasitic charging trigger based on a user input provided on the one or more input interfaces.
8. The trailer of claim 1, wherein the drive activation trigger is uphill travel of the trailer.
9. The trailer of claim 1, wherein the drive activation trigger is acceleration of the trailer from a stop.
10. The trailer of claim 1, wherein the energy recovery trigger is downhill travel of the trailer.
11. The trailer of claim 1, wherein the energy recovery trigger is deceleration of the trailer.
12. The trailer of claim 1, wherein the parasitic charging trigger is when the trailer is moving on a substantially horizontal surface.
13. The trailer of claim 1, wherein activating the one or more motors to power the one or more wheels includes activating the one or more motors to power the one or more wheels at an amount based on real-time conditions as determined by one or more sensors, and wherein the one or more sensors are operatively connected to the one or more processors.
14. A method for a trailer, the trailer including one or more power sources, one or more motors operatively connected to receive electrical energy from the one or more power sources, and one or more wheels operatively connected to the one or more motors for selectively powering the one or more wheels, the method comprising: detecting a trailer-related trigger, the trailer-related trigger being one of a drive activation trigger, an energy recovery trigger, or a parasitic charging trigger; responsive to detecting a drive activation trigger, activating the one or more motors to power the one or more wheels; responsive to detecting an energy recovery trigger, causing the one or more power sources to be charged by recovering energy from the trailer; and responsive to detecting a parasitic charging trigger, causing the one or more power sources to be charged using power generated by a main vehicle operatively connected to the trailer.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein activating the one or more motors to power the one or more wheels includes activating the one or more motors to power the one or more wheels at an amount based on real-time conditions as determined by one or more sensors.
16. The method of claim 14, wherein detecting a trailer-related trigger, the trailer-related trigger being one of a drive activation trigger, an energy recovery trigger, or a parasitic charging trigger is based on data acquired by one or more sensors.
17. The method of claim 14, wherein detecting a trailer-related trigger, the trailer-related trigger being one of a drive activation trigger, an energy recovery trigger, or a parasitic charging trigger is based on a user input.
18. The method of claim 14, wherein the drive activation trigger is uphill travel of the trailer or acceleration of the trailer from a stop.
19. The method of claim 14, wherein the energy recovery trigger is downhill travel of the trailer or deceleration of the trailer.
20. The method of claim 14, wherein the parasitic charging is when the trailer is moving on a substantially horizontal surface.
