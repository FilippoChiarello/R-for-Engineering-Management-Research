<title>
Board lumber grading using deep learning semantic segmentation techniques
</title>

<abstract>
A method of board lumber grading is performed in an industrial environment on a machine learning framework configured as an interface to a machine learning-based deep convolutional network that is trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels on semantic segmentation. The method uses deep learning techniques that are applied to semantic segmentation to delineate board lumber characteristics, including their sizes and boundaries.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method of detecting defining characteristics of wood material to facilitate one or both of grading and optimizing board lumber by machine learning techniques, comprising: creating a definition of wood characteristics learned from images of multiple wood specimens each of which having a first pair of opposite sides and a second pair of opposite sides, the wood specimen images acquired from multiple wood characteristic channel sensors that provide channel sensor outputs produced by automatic scanning of the multiple wood specimens and identifying the wood characteristics, the wood characteristic channel sensors including a geometric sensor developing profile information taken on the first and second pairs of opposite sides to provide wood specimen thickness measurements, and the wood specimen images represented by layers of input layer pixel data derived from the channel sensor outputs, each layer of the input layer pixel data representing a different one of the channel sensor outputs, the input layer pixel data corresponding to sets of pixels representing regions of each of the wood specimen images, and the input layer pixel data representing classes of the wood characteristics within specified boundaries of the regions at identified locations; receiving, by a machine learning framework, the input layer pixel data, the machine learning framework supporting a training processing unit in which is performed a set of deep learning algorithms developed to train a machine learning-based convolutional neural network on semantic segmentation, the set of deep learning algorithms performing semantic segmentation on the input layer pixel data to determine edges in and network learned weights for collections of pixels in the sets of pixels, the collections of pixels encompassed by the edges and corresponding to the regions of each of the multiple wood specimens; providing, to the machine learning framework, milled board image data representing a milled board of wood, the milled board image data including input layer pixel data produced by multiple sensor channels from each one of which are derived milled board pixels of images defining wood characteristics of the milled board of wood; applying the milled board image data to the convolutional neural network operating on an inference processing unit, the convolutional neural network performing semantic segmentation on the milled board image data to determine, for the milled board pixels, probability values for use in forming a series of probability maps, each probability map in the series corresponding to a different one of the classes of wood characteristics so that each milled board pixel of the milled board pixels has a probability value for each of the classes of wood characteristics; and the inference processing unit deriving, from the probability values determined for the milled board pixels in the series of probability maps, a solution identifying which ones of the milled board pixels belong to classes of the wood characteristics and specifying the classes to which the identified milled board pixels belong.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising providing a rendering of the milled board of wood, the rendering identifying locations and boundaries of the milled board pixels representing the classes of wood characteristics of the milled board of wood.
3. The method of claim 2, in which the rendering provided as an output includes a box encompassing and thereby indicating a region of the milled board of wood identifying one of the wood characteristics.
4. The method of claim 1, in which the inference processing unit includes a graphics processing unit (GPU), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or a field programmable gate array (FPGA) for forming the series of probability maps.
5. The method of claim 1, in which the inference processing unit includes a central processing unit (CPU) for deriving the solution from the series of probability maps formed.
6. The method of claim 1, in which the solution derived by the inference processing unit is developed in constant time for equal area input milled boards of wood, irrespective of how many classes of the wood characteristics are identified on the milled board of wood.
7. The method of claim 1, in which the regions identifying locations of the wood characteristics are labeled by blob overlays placed around the regions on the wood specimen images.
8. The method of claim 1, in which the definition of wood characteristics includes classes of defects.
9. The method of claim 8, in which classes of defects include knot qualities.
10. The method of claim 9, in which the knot qualities include one or more of Red, Dead, Blonde, Decayed, Bark Encasement, and Slough to each of which deep learning is applied.
11. The method of claim 1, in which the solution is derived for grading board lumber that is inspected in an industrial environment.
12. The method of claim 1, in which the automatic scanning of the multiple wood specimens is configured to be carried out with use of the wood characteristic channel sensors to identify and locate an indefinite number of different defects.
