Method, apparatus, and computer program product for predicting web browsing behaviors of consumers
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the present invention provide methods, systems, apparatuses, and computer program products for predicting consumer behavior. In one embodiment a method is provided comprising automatically creating a link graph comprising nodes representing webpages, links representing hyperlinks, and weights for each link representing a number of times a hyperlink associated with the respective link redirected the a user devices from a webpage associated with a first node connected to the link to a webpage associated with a second node connected to the link; and determining based on the link graph a programmatically expected path for a particular user, wherein the programmatically expected path identifies, at least, two or more webpages that the particular user is programmatically expected to visit and specifying a programmatically expected order at which the particular user will visit the webpages.

2. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one memory stores instructions that, with the at least one processor, further cause the system to: determine that a similarity measure between the first node and the second node meets the pre-specified configurable thresholds; and merge the first node and the second node.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the similarity measure is based on in-link and out-link similarities between the first and second nodes, wherein the in-link similarities are indicative of a measure of similarity between nodes associated with webpages that users visited prior to visiting webpages associated with the first and second nodes, and wherein out-link similarities are indicative of a measure of similarity between nodes associated with webpages that users visited after visiting webpages associated with the first and second nodes.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one memory stores instructions that, with the at least one processor, further cause the system to: determine based on the historical data for the particular website user that user visited a webpage associated with a third node at a third time; determine based on the historical data for the particular website user that the particular website user visited a same webpage associated with the third node after the third time, wherein the particular website user visited one or more webpages associated with nodes different from the third node after the third time and before visiting the same webpage after the third time; filtering user visits to a same website associated with the third node after the third time and user visits to the one or more webpages associated with nodes different from the third node such that filtered visits are not available as historical data for the particular website user.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one memory stores instructions that, with the at least one processor, further cause the system to: determine that the particular website user is at webpage associated with a third node; determine based on the link graph and historical data for the particular website user, that the particular website user is likely to be redirected to a fourth webpage associated with a fourth node based on user interactions; in response to determining that the particular website user is likely to be redirected to a fourth webpage based on user interactions, perform a particular action.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the particular action is presenting to a user device of the particular website user an advertisement based on the particular website user's historical user data, wherein interaction with the advertisement redirects the particular website user to a webpage of the website.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one memory stores instructions that, with the at least one processor, further cause the system to: determine based on the link graph that a modification of the website layout increases the programmatically expected traffic to the website; and perform the modification to one or more particular webpages of the website.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the modification comprises providing one or more additional hyperlinks at a particular webpage, wherein the hyperlinks redirect user devices to a different webpage in response to user interactions.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein the modification comprises removing one or more hyperlinks from a particular webpage, wherein the hyperlinks redirect user devices to a different webpage in response to user interactions.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one memory stores instructions that, with the at least one processor, further cause the system to: determine based on the link graph that traffic to a website will meet a pre-specified configurable threshold, and modify the computer server.
