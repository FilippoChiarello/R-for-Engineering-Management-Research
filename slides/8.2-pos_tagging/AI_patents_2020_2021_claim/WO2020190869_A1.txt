MONITORING OF POLISHING PAD TEXTURE IN CHEMICAL MECHANICAL POLISHING
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus for chemical mechanical polishing includes a platen having a surface to support a polishing pad, a carrier head to hold a substrate against a polishing surface of the polishing pad, a pad conditioner to press an abrasive body against the polishing surface, an in-situ polishing pad monitoring system including an imager disposed above the platen to capture an image of the polishing pad, and a controller configured to receive the image from the monitoring system and generate a measure of polishing pad surface roughness based on the image. The controller can use machine-learning based image processing to generate the measure of surface roughness.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. An apparatus for chemical mechanical polishing, comprising:
a platen having a surface to support a polishing pad;
a carrier head to hold a substrate against a polishing surface of the polishing pad;
a pad conditioner to press an abrasive body against the polishing surface; an in-situ polishing pad monitoring system including an imager disposed above the platen to capture an image of the polishing pad; and
a controller configured to receive the image from the monitoring system and generate a measure of polishing pad surface texture based on the image.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to operate as a machine learning based image processing system, and to input the image to the image processing system.
3. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the machine learning based image processing system comprises a supervised learning module.
4. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the machine learning based image processing system comprises a dimensional reduction module to receive the image and output component values, and wherein the controller is configured to input the component values to the image to the supervised learning module.
5. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the controller is configured to input the image directly to the supervised learning module.
6. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the controller is configured to operate the supervised learning module as an artificial neural network.
7. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to receive other data including a value for a parameter and is configured to generate the measure of polishing pad surface texture on the image and the value of the parameter.
8. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein the parameter comprises a polishing control parameter, a state parameter, a measurement from a sensor in the polishing system or a measurement of the polishing pad by a sensor outside the polishing system.
9. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the parameter comprises a platen rotation rate, a slurry dispense rate, a slurry composition, a number of substrates since the polishing pad was changed, or a measurement of the surface roughness of the polishing pad by a stand-alone metrology station before the polishing pad was installed on the platen.
10. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to at least one of halt a conditioning process or adjust a conditioning parameter based on the measure of polishing pad surface texture.
11. A method of polishing, comprising:
bringing a substrate into contact with a polishing pad on a platen;
generating relative motion between the substrate and the polishing pad;
capturing an image of the polishing pad with an optical sensor;
generating a measurement of surface texture of the polishing pad by inputting the image to a machine learning based image processing system.
12. The method of claim 11, comprising receiving training data including a plurality of pairs of training images and training values, and training a supervised learning algorithm in the learning based image processing system using the training data.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the training values comprise surface roughness values.
14. The method of claim 11, comprising halting a conditioning process or adjusting a conditioning parameter based on the measure of polishing pad surface texture. 15. The method of claim 11, comprising moving the optical sensor radially across the polishing pad.
