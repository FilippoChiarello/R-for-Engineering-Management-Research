EVALUATION DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A content evaluation device includes a usage trend storage unit that stores, for each user, trend information indicating a usage trend in each time period and for each content type, a score calculation unit that calculates a recommendation score for each content, a classification unit that clusters a group of users having similar trend information on the basis of the trend information of each user, a derivation unit that derives overall trend information from the trend information of affiliated users belonging to the clustered group of users, a score adjustment unit that adjusts the recommendation score of each content in reflection of the overall trend information in a target time period to a recommendation score for each content, and a determination unit that determines content to recommend to the target user in the target time period on the basis of the adjusted recommendation score of each content.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An evaluation device comprising: a preference trend storage unit configured to store trend information for each of a plurality of users, indicating a trend in a preference for content in each of a plurality of time periods and for each type of content; a score calculation unit configured to calculate a recommendation score for each of a plurality of pieces of content with respect to a recommendation target user; a classification unit configured to cluster a group of users having trend information similar to that of the recommendation target user on the basis of the trend information for each of the plurality of users stored in the preference trend storage unit; a derivation unit configured to derive an overall trend of the trend information of affiliated users belonging to the group of users clustered by the classification unit as overall trend information on the basis of the trend information of the affiliated users; a score adjustment unit configured to adjust the recommendation score for each of the plurality of pieces of content in reflection of the overall trend information of the type of content to which the plurality of pieces of content belong in the target time period in the recommendation score for each of the plurality of pieces of content calculated by the score calculation unit; and a determination unit configured to determine content to recommend to the target user with respect to the target time period on the basis of the recommendation score for each of the plurality of pieces of content adjusted by the score adjustment unit.
2. The evaluation device according to claim 1, wherein the preference trend storage unit stores trend information indicating a usage trend of the content as the trend information indicating the trend in the preference.
3. The evaluation device according to claim 1, wherein the preference trend storage unit stores a numerical value indicating the trends in the preference for the content as the trend information, and the classification unit develops the trend information in each of the plurality of time periods and for each type into a vector, and clusters a group of users having similar vectors.
4. The evaluation device according to claim 1, wherein the preference trend storage unit stores a numerical value indicating the trends in the preference for the content as the trend information, and the derivation unit calculates an average value, a median value, or an addition value with respect to the trend information of the affiliated users belonging to the group of users to derive the overall trend information.
5. The evaluation device according to claim 1, wherein the score adjustment unit adjusts the recommendation score by adding a numerical value based on the overall trend information to the recommendation score or multiplying the recommendation score by the numerical value based on the overall trend information.
