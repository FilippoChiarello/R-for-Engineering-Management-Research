METHODS FOR PRODUCING A MHC MULTIMER
</title>

<abstract>
The current invention relates to a fast, flexible and efficient method to generate MHC multimers loaded with a desired peptide, by using temperature-mediated peptide exchange. The method may be used at the same time in parallel for different desired peptides. In the method conditional peptides are used that form stable peptide-MHC complexes at low temperatures, but dissociated when exposed to a defined elevated temperature. The resulting conditional MHC I complexes and multimers can be loaded with peptides of choice.

<claims>
1. A method for producing a MHC molecule, the method comprising a. Providing at a reduced temperature an MHC molecule having bound thereto in the peptide-binding groove of said MHC molecule a template peptide that dissociates from said MHC molecule at an increased temperature, wherein said MHC molecule is preferably a human leukocyte antigen—A (HLA-A) molecule; b. Changing the temperature to an increased temperature, therewith dissociating the template peptide from said MHC molecule; and c. Contacting the MHC molecule at said increased temperature with a desired peptide for binding to the peptide-binding groove of said MHC molecule, under conditions allowing the desired peptide to bind to the peptide-binding groove of said MHC molecule.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the reduced temperature is a temperature of 10 degrees Celsius or less and/or the increased temperature is a temperature of 15 degrees Celsius or more, preferably wherein the reduced temperature is 4 degrees Celsius or less and/or wherein the increased temperature is between, and including, 20 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees Celsius.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein b) and c) are performed simultaneously.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the desired peptide is provided in excess of the MHC molecule with the template peptide bound thereto, preferably wherein the excess is at least about 5-fold, 10-fold 20-fold, 30-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold, 200-fold molar excess.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the MHC molecule in step a) is provided as a monomer, as a complex comprising at least two MHC molecules, or as a multimer.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the MHC molecule is part of a complex comprising the MHC molecule and at least one other molecule, preferably at least one other protein, preferably at least one other MHC molecule.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the MHC molecule is a human HLA-A molecule, and wherein said HLA-A molecule is preferably selected from HLA-A*02 and HLA-A*02:01.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the template peptide is obtained by substitution of at least one, two or more anchor residues, preferably of one or two anchor residues.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the template peptide is a polypeptide comprising a. the polypeptide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 (IAKEPVHGV), SEQ ID NO:2 (IAKEPVHGA) or SEQ ID NO:3 (FAPGNAPAL); or b. the polypeptide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:3 having 1, 2, 3, or 4 amino acid substitutions, deletions or insertions.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the method is performed in parallel for different desired peptides for binding to the peptide-binding groove of said MHC molecule.
11. The method of claim 1 wherein the MHC molecule provided in step a) is produced and loaded with the template peptide at the reduced temperature.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the MHC molecule having bound thereto in the peptide-binding groove of said MHC molecule a template peptide is provided by refolding of a MHC molecule at a temperature of 10 degrees or less in the presence of the template peptide.
13. The method of claim 1 wherein the method is cell-free.
14. The method of claim 1 further comprising detecting binding of said desired peptide to said MHC-molecule, preferably wherein said binding is detected by detecting a label that is associated with said desired peptide, preferably wherein said desired peptide comprises said label.
15. The method of claim 1, for determining binding of said desired peptide in the presence of a test or reference compound.
16. 16-22. (canceled)
23. A template peptide that binds with a MHC molecule at the reduced temperature but not at the increased temperature, wherein the MHC molecule is preferably a human HLA-A molecule, preferably a human HLA-A molecule selected from HLA-A*02 and HLA-A*02:01.
24. A template peptide of claim 23 wherein the template peptide is a polypeptide comprising a. the polypeptide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 (IAKEPVHGV), SEQ ID NO:2 (IAKEPVHGA) or SEQ ID NO:3 (FAPGNAPAL); or b. the polypeptide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:3 having 1, 2, 3, or 4 amino acid substitutions, deletions or insertions
25. 25-27. (canceled)
28. A composition stored at a temperature of, with increasing preferences, less than 10 degrees Celsius, less than 0 degrees Celsius, less than −20 degrees Celsius wherein the composition comprises an MHC molecule having bound thereto in the peptide-binding groove of said MHC molecule a template peptide that dissociates from said MHC molecule at a temperature of 15 degrees Celsius or more, and preferably further comprises NaCl, preferably 100-600 mM NaCl, more preferably 250-350 mM NaCl and/or glycerol, preferably 1-50% (vol/vol) glycerol, preferably 5-15% (vol/vol) glycerol; preferably wherein the MHC molecule is a multimer, wherein said MHC molecule is preferably a human HLA-A molecule, preferably a human HLA-A molecule selected from HLA-A*02 and HLA-A*02:01.
29. 29-34. (canceled)
35. The composition of claim 28 wherein the template peptide is a polypeptide comprising a. the polypeptide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 (IAKEPVHGV), SEQ ID NO:2 (IAKEPVHGA) or SEQ ID NO:3 (FAPGNAPAL); or b. the polypeptide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:3 having 1, 2, 3, or 4 amino acid substitutions, deletions or insertions.
