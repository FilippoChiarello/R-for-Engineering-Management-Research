<title>
OPTIMIZED TRANSPORTATION SELECTION
</title>

<abstract>
Facilitation of optimized transportation selection relative to user travel objectives and user context is provided. A system can include a memory and a processor that executes computer executable components. The computer executable components can include: an objective component that determines travel objectives of a user; a context component that determines context of the user; an analyzer component that analyzes transportation related data relevant to the travel objectives of the user, wherein the analyzer component performs a utility-based analysis that weighs costs versus benefits associated with respective transportation options relative to the travel objectives of the user; and an optimization component that outputs a travel itinerary to the user that includes an optimized transportation selection relative to the user travel objectives and user context.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system, comprising: a memory that stores computer executable components; a processor that executes computer executable components stored in the memory; an objective component that determines travel objectives of a user; a context component that determines context of the user; an analyzer component that analyzes transportation related data relevant to the travel objectives of the user, wherein the analyzer component performs a utility-based analysis that weighs costs versus benefits associated with respective transportation options relative to the travel objectives of the user; and an optimization component that outputs a travel itinerary to the user that includes an optimized transportation selection relative to the user travel objectives and user context.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising a classification component that classifies the transportation data.
3. The system of claim 2, further comprising a scoring component that dynamically generates for the user a qualitative score of the transportation options from classified subsets of the transportation data.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the optimization component factors financial costs associated with respective transportation options and cost associated with the user being late to a destination.
5. The system of claim 1, further comprising an avatar component that generates an avatar that provides the optimized itinerary to the user through a virtual interface.
6. The system of claim 1, further comprising an integration component that integrates the system with other visualization tools.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the analyzer component employs crowdsourced data to facilitate analysis of the transportation options.
8. The system of claim 3, further comprising an artificial intelligence component that facilitates the determination of the qualitative score.
9. The system of claim 1, further comprising a visualization component that facilitates visualizing output from the optimization component in an augmented realty environment.
10. The system of claim 6, wherein the integration component dynamically transitions and executes the system on a wireless mobile device.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the optimization component dynamically revises the itinerary based on an event.
12. The system of claim 1, further comprising a scheduling component that automatically books respective transportation options output by the optimization component.
13. A computer-implemented method comprising: determining, by a device operatively coupled to a processor, travel objectives of a user; determining, by the device, context of the user; analyzing, by the device, transportation related data relevant to the travel objectives of the user, wherein a utility-based analysis is performed that weighs costs versus benefits associated with respective transportation options relative to the travel objectives of the user; and outputting, by the device, a travel itinerary to the user that includes an optimized transportation selection relative to the user travel objectives and user context.
14. The method of claim 13, further comprising classifying the transportation data.
15. The method of claim 14, further comprising dynamically generating for the user a qualitative score of the transportation options from classified subsets of the transportation data.
16. The method of claim 13, further comprising factoring financial costs associated with respective transportation options and cost associated with the user being late to a destination.
17. The method of claim 13, further comprising employing crowdsourced data to facilitate analysis of the transportation options.
18. The method of claim 15, further comprising using artificial intelligence to facilitate the determination of the qualitative score.
19. A computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions are executable by a processor to cause the processor to: determine, by the processor, travel objectives of a user; determine, by the processor, context of the user; analyze, by the processor, transportation related data relevant to the travel objectives of the user, wherein a utility-based analysis is performed that weighs costs versus benefits associated with respective transportation options relative to the travel objectives of the user; and output, by the processor, a travel itinerary to the user that includes an optimized transportation selection relative to the user travel objectives and user context.
20. The computer program product of claim 19, further comprising: classifying, by the processor, the transportation data; and dynamically generating, by the processor, a qualitative score for the user of the transportation options from classified subsets of the transportation data.
