<abstract>
A method of training an artificial neural network The artificial neural network comprising a plurality of connections connecting nodes arranged in at least an initial and a subsequent layer. The method comprises receiving a training example, the training example having input values, a target, and an associated training salience value indicating an importance of the input values to determining the target. The method further comprises determining salience values for nodes of the initial layer from the training salience value; determining an activation value for at least one node of the subsequent layer by propagating the input values using a subset of the connections selected based on the determined salience values for the nodes of the initial layer; and training the artificial neural network using the activation value, the trained artificial neural network configured to determine a relationship between the input data values and the target.
