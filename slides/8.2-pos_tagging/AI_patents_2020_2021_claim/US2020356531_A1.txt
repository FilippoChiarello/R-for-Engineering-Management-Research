DERIVED RELATIONSHIP FOR COLLABORATION DOCUMENTS
</title>

<abstract>
A method, computer system, and computer program product for collaborative document relations modeling are provided. The embodiment may include parsing, by a processor, a document corpus utilizing topic modeling and distance analysis techniques. The embodiment may also include deriving a collaborative document relational model to combine the results of the parsing into a matrix. The embodiment may further include grouping content of the parsed document corpus through document clustering utilizing the generated collaborative document relational model. The embodiment may also include displaying the grouped content as document clusters in a graphical user interface of a document management application

<claims>
1. A processor-implemented method for collaborative document relations modeling, the method comprising: parsing, by a processor, a document corpus utilizing topic modeling and distance analysis techniques; deriving a collaborative document relational model to combine the results of the parsing into a matrix; grouping content of the parsed document corpus through document clustering utilizing the generated collaborative document relational model; and displaying the grouped content as document clusters in a graphical user interface of a document management application.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: ingesting the document corpus from a document collaboration platform.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: calculating cosine differences of topics found in the document corpus to determine relationships between the topics.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: utilizing topic modeling algorithms to determine key terms in the document corpus.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: crowdsourcing usage patterns of similar collaborative documents; and updating the generated collaborative document relational model.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining the order of documents to be collaborated based on the grouped content and the matrix.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the document clusters are integrated with existing document management applications as a form of a visual overlay.
8. A computer system for collaborative document relations modeling, the computer system comprising: one or more processors, one or more computer-readable memories, one or more computer-readable tangible storage media, and program instructions stored on at least one of the one or more tangible storage media for execution by at least one of the one or more processors via at least one of the one or more memories, wherein the computer system is capable of performing a method comprising: parsing, by a processor, a document corpus utilizing topic modeling and distance analysis techniques; deriving a collaborative document relational model to combine the results of the parsing into a matrix; grouping content of the parsed document corpus through document clustering utilizing the generated collaborative document relational model; and displaying the grouped content as document clusters in a graphical user interface of a document management application.
9. The computer system of claim 8, further comprising: ingesting the document corpus from a document collaboration platform.
10. The computer system of claim 8, further comprising: calculating cosine differences of topics found in the document corpus to determine relationships between the topics.
11. The computer system of claim 8, further comprising: utilizing topic modeling algorithms to determine key terms in the document corpus.
12. The computer system of claim 8, further comprising: crowdsourcing usage patterns of similar collaborative documents; and updating the generated collaborative document relational model.
13. The computer system of claim 8, further comprising: determining the order of documents to be collaborated based on the grouped content and the matrix.
14. The computer system of claim 8, wherein the document clusters are integrated with existing document management applications as a form of a visual overlay.
15. A computer program product for collaborative document relations modeling, the computer program product comprising: one or more computer-readable tangible storage media and program instructions stored on at least one of the one or more tangible storage media, the program instructions executable by a processor of a computer to perform a method, the method comprising: parsing, by a processor, a document corpus utilizing topic modeling and distance analysis techniques; deriving a collaborative document relational model to combine the results of the parsing into a matrix; grouping content of the parsed document corpus through document clustering utilizing the generated collaborative document relational model; and displaying the grouped content as document clusters in a graphical user interface of a document management application.
16. The computer program product of claim 15, further comprising: ingesting the document corpus from a document collaboration platform.
17. The computer program product of claim 15, further comprising: calculating cosine differences of topics found in the document corpus to determine relationships between the topics.
18. The computer program product of claim 15, further comprising: utilizing topic modeling algorithms to determine key terms in the document corpus.
19. The computer program product of claim 15, further comprising: crowdsourcing usage patterns of similar collaborative documents; and updating the generated collaborative document relational model.
20. The computer program product of claim 15, further comprising: determining the order of documents to be collaborated based on the grouped content and the matrix.
