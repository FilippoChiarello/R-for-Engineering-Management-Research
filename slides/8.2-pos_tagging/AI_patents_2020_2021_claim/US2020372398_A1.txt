<claims>
1. A method for utilizing provenance data to improve machine learning, the method comprising: collecting provenance data; identifying model quality improvements based on the collected provenance data; identifying related models based on the collected provenance data; and recommending model quality improvements to a user.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the provenance data is collected from a provenance store.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the provenance data includes data origins, data characteristics, data relationships, data transformations or data movements.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the provenance data related to a machine learning model includes model metrics, training datasets, feature sets, a usage history, reviews, ratings, feedback, machine learning algorithms, model metadata or deployment metadata.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the provenance data relating to a dataset includes a usage history, a forward lineage, a backward lineage, transformations applied for data preparation and data cleaning, column classifications, reviews, ratings, feedback or a data distribution.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying the model quality improvements include analyzing datasets, transformations of data and machine learning algorithms and parameters.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying the related models include analyzing provenance data-based relationships, context-based relationships, access patterns or usage-based relationships and data profile-based relationships.
8. A computer system for utilizing provenance data to improve machine learning, comprising: one or more processors, one or more computer-readable memories, one or more computer-readable tangible storage media, and program instructions stored on at least one of the one or more computer-readable tangible storage media for execution by at least one of the one or more processors via at least one of the one or more computer-readable memories, wherein the computer system is capable of performing a method comprising: collecting provenance data; identifying model quality improvements based on the collected provenance data; identifying related models based on the collected provenance data; and recommending model quality improvements to a user.
9. The computer system of claim 8, wherein the provenance data is collected from a provenance store.
10. The computer system of claim 8, wherein the provenance data includes data origins, data characteristics, data relationships, data transformations or data movements.
