Demand classification based pipeline system for time-series data forecasting
</title>

<abstract>
A pipeline system for time-series data forecasting using a distributed computing environment is disclosed herein. In one example, a pipeline for forecasting time series is generated. The pipeline represents a sequence of operations for processing the time series to produce modeling results such as forecasts of the time series. The pipeline includes a segmentation operation for categorizing the time series into multiple demand classes based on demand characteristics of the time series. The pipeline also includes multiple sub-pipelines corresponding to the multiple demand classes. Each of the sub-pipelines applies a model strategy to the time series in the corresponding demand class. The model strategy is selected from multiple candidate model strategies based on predetermined relationships between the demand classes and the candidate model strategies. The pipeline is executed to determine the modeling results for the time series.
