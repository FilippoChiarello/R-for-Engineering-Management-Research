LOCALIZATION OF MACHINE-READABLE INDICIA IN DIGITAL CAPTURE SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosures relates to finding or localizing machine readable indicia (e.g., a barcode or digital watermark) in imagery. One claim recites an apparatus comprising: memory for buffering blocks of image data, the image data having been captured with a camera and depicting a printed object; one or more processors programmed for: generating an edge orientation sensitive feature set from the image data; using a first trained classifier to determine whether the feature set includes data representing a barcode; and using N additional trained classifiers to determine an orientation angle associated with the barcode, wherein N comprises an integer greater than 3, and wherein the orientation angle is selected based on a probability metric. Of course, other claims and combinations are provided too.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: obtaining data representing optically captured imagery, the optically captured imagery depicting printed or displayed material; using one or more programmed processors: generating an edge orientation sensitive feature set from the data representing the optically captured imagery; using a first trained classifier to determine whether the feature set includes data representing a barcode; and using N additional trained classifiers to determine an orientation angle associated with the barcode, wherein N comprises an integer greater than 3.
2. The method of claim 1 in which at least two orientation angles associated with the barcode are determined using the N additional trained classifiers.
3. The method of claim 1 in which the N additional trained classifiers operate on a feature set centered at or around an image area associated with the barcode, in which the image area is a subset of the data representing optically captured imagery.
4. The method of claim 1 in which the first trained classifier is trained based on a binary decision of present or not.
5. The method of claim 1 in which the first trained classifier is trained based on a linear regressor.
6. An apparatus comprising: memory for buffering blocks of image data, the image data having been captured with a camera and depicting a printed object; one or more processors programmed for: generating an edge orientation sensitive feature set from the image data; using a first trained classifier to determine whether the feature set includes data representing a barcode; and using N additional trained classifiers to determine an orientation angle associated with the barcode, wherein N comprises an integer greater than 3, and wherein the orientation angle is determined based on a probability metric.
7. The apparatus of claim 6 in which at least two orientation angles associated with the barcode are determined using the N additional trained classifiers.
8. The apparatus of claim 6 in which the N additional trained classifiers operate on a feature set centered at or around an image area associated with the barcode, in which the image area is a subset of the image data.
9. The apparatus of claim 6 in which the first trained classifier is trained based on a binary decision of barcode present or not.
10. The apparatus of claim 6 in which the first trained classifier is trained based on a linear regressor.
11. An apparatus comprising: electronic memory for buffering blocks of image data, the image data having been captured with a digital camera and depicting a printed or displayed object; means for generating an edge orientation sensitive feature set from the image data; means for determining whether the feature set includes data representing a barcode, in which said means for determining utilizes a first trained classifier; and means for determining an orientation angle associated with the barcode, in which said means for determining utilizes N additional trained classifiers to, wherein N comprises an integer greater than 3, and wherein the orientation angle is determined based on a probability metric.
12. The apparatus of claim 11 in which at least two orientation angles associated with the barcode are determined using the N additional trained classifiers.
13. The apparatus of claim 11 in which the N additional trained classifiers operate on a feature set centered at or around an image area associated with the barcode, in which the image area is a subset of the image data.
14. The apparatus of claim 11 in which the first trained classifier is trained based on a binary decision of barcode present or not.
15. The apparatus of claim 11 in which the first trained classifier is trained based on a linear regressor.
16. The apparatus of claim 11 further comprising means for generating a 2-dimensional heat-map including different colors corresponding to different probabilities of image areas likely including a barcode, the heat-map including a representation of at least a portion of the depicted printed or displayed object; and means for displaying the heat-map.
