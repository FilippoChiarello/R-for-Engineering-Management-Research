<title>
SENSITIVE DATA DETECTION IN COMMUNICATION DATA
</title>

<abstract>
The described technologies leverage a trained evaluation function to analyze an email message to determine if a password is included in the text of the email message. The text of the email message may be vectorized using a character lookup table including vector values for each ASCII character. The trained evaluation function analyzes the vectorized text to determine if a password is included in the text of the mail message. An email message found to include a password may be placed in a quarantine storage to at least temporality prevent the email message from being disseminated to a recipient.

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method, comprising:
identifying communication data to analyze for sensitive data;
evaluating the communication data to identify at least one data token included in the communication data, the at least one data token including a plurality of characters;
converting each of the plurality of characters included in the at least one data token to a vector comprising vector values obtained from a character lookup table;
generating a vector list including each vector representing each of the plurality of characters included in the at least one data token; and
evaluating the vector list using a trained evaluation function to determine if the at least one data token comprises sensitive data,
when the at least one data token comprises sensitive data, associating the communication data in a quarantine storage,
when the at least one data token is devoid of sensitive data, allowing dissemination of the communication data.
2. The computer implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the communication data is associated with an email, text message, or other electronic message and the evaluating is to determine if the at least one data token comprises password data.
3. The computer implemented method according to claim 1, wherein trained evaluation function is based on a recursive machine learning model trained using a data set including known space delimited passwords and a data set including space delimited non password characters.
4. The computer implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the trained evaluation function is based on a recursive machine learning model trained using vectorized characters generated from the character lookup table.
5. The computer implemented method according to claim 4, wherein the character lookup table comprises a plurality of characters, each character of the plurality of characters including a vector with associated values that represent one or more features or characteristics associated with the character.
6. The computer implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the character lookup table comprises the plurality of characters, each character the plurality of characters including a vector with associated values that represent one or more features or characteristics associated with the character.
7. The computer implemented method according to claim 1, wherein when the evaluating determines that the at least one data token comprises sensitive data, and prior to associating the communication data in a quarantine storage, evaluating a predetermined number of characters preceding and/or following the at least one data token to identify a context associated with the at least one data token, and determining the at least one data token comprises sensitive data when the context supports the determination that the at least one data token comprises sensitive data.
8. A computing device, comprising:
a processor;
a computer-readable storage medium in communication with the processor, the computer-readable storage medium having computer-executable instructions stored thereupon which, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to:
identify communication data to analyze for one or more passwords;
evaluate the communication data to identify at least one data token included in the communication data, the at least one data token including a plurality of characters;
convert each of the plurality of characters included in the at least one data token to a vector comprising vector values obtained from a character lookup table; generate a vector list including each vector representing each of the plurality of characters included in the at least one data token; and
evaluate the vector list using a trained evaluation function to determine if the at least one data token comprises a password,
when the at least one data token comprises a password, inform a user that the communication data includes the password and prevent dissemination of the communication data,
when the at least one data token is devoid of a password, allow dissemination of the communication data.
9. The computing device according to claim 8, wherein the communication data is associated with an email, text message, or other electronic message.
10. The computing device according to claim 8, wherein trained evaluation function is based on a recursive machine learning model trained using a data set including known space delimited passwords and a data set including space delimited non-password characters.
11. The computing device according to claim 8, wherein the trained evaluation function is based on a recursive machine learning model trained using vectorized characters generated from the character lookup table.
12. The computing device according to claim 11, wherein the character lookup table comprises a plurality of characters, each character of the plurality of characters including a vector with associated values that represent one or more characteristics associated with the character.
13. The computing device according to claim 8, wherein the character lookup table comprises the plurality of characters, each character the plurality of characters including a vector with associated values that represent one or more characteristics associated with the character.
14. The computing device according to claim 8, wherein the computer-executable instructions, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to:
evaluate a predetermined number of characters preceding and/or following the at least one data token to identify a context associated with the at least one data token, and determine the at least one data token comprises the password when the context supports the determination that the at least one data token comprises the password.
