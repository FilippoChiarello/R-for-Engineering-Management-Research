</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method to determine patient body temperature, comprising:
measuring, by a first sensor, a first temperature value at a skin surface on a patient body;
measuring, by a second sensor, a second temperature value of a sensor ambient air temperature at the first sensor;
determining a core body thermal exchange at the skin surface on the patient body using the first temperature value and the second temperature value;
determining the patient body temperature by using the core body thermal exchange;
controlling an absolute amplitude level of the core body thermal exchange; and outputting a patient body temperature.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: canceling ambient temperature fluctuations from the skin temperature value by using an adaptive filter.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the core body thermal exchange at the skin surface on the body is determined by subtracting an ambient filter output from the skin temperature value.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the controlling the absolute amplitude level value of the core body thermal exchange includes subtracting an AC offset of the core body thermal exchange and adding a DC calibration value that transforms a time varying change of trend of the core body thermal exchange to an absolute scale comparable to standard patient temp measurement.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the core body thermal exchange includes at least one of:
in a case of the first calibration, the AC offset is the value of the core body thermal exchange at the temperature sensor settling period, or
in a case of a recalibration, the AC offset is the value of the core body thermal exchange at a time of a recalibration request.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
initializing a settling time flag (ts_flag) and a calibration flag (cai_flag) with initial values.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the initial values of the settling time flag and the calibration flag is zero.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein input values of the first temperature value f(n) and a reference second temperature value din) are passed through an adaptive filter to produce an adaptive filter output y(n).
9. The method of claim 8, wherein filter coefficients are updated by minimizing an error according to: e(n)=d(n)-y(n), wherein the d{n) is a desired reference input value of the second temperature value, and
wherein the y(n) is the adaptive filter output.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the core body thermal exchange T_x between the skin body surface and a core body is determined by subtracting the adaptive filter output from the first temperature value according to T_x (n) = f(n)-y(n),
wherein the f(n) is the first temperature value, and
wherein the y(n) is the adaptive filter output.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the patient body temperature output is invalidated with a unique numerical code until a settling flag (ts_flag) and the calibration flag (cal_flag) are onset or changed from 0 to 1.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the patient body temperature output is same as that of input calibration temperature value until the temperature sensor is determined to have settled down to a steady state or until the desired settling time duration is elapsed.
13. The method of claim 6, further comprising, outputting the patient body temperature to a display.
14. A wireless sensor device for temperature monitoring, comprising:
a first sensor that measures a first temperature value at a skin surface on a patient body; a second sensor that measures a second temperature value of a sensor ambient air temperature at the first sensor;
a computing device including a memory and a processor, wherein the computer device receives the first and second temperature values and implements by the processor an application stored in the memory to:
determine a core body thermal exchange at the skin surface on the patient body using the first temperature value and the second temperature value,
determine the patient body temperature by using the core body thermal exchange, and
controlling an absolute amplitude level of the core body thermal exchange; and
a display device that displays the patient body temperature.
15. The wireless sensor device of claim 14, wherein the computing device further implements the application to:
cancel ambient temperature fluctuations from the skin temperature value;
determine a body core thermal exchange at the skin surface on the patient body; and
control an absolute amplitude value of the body core thermal exchange.
16. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing executable instructions that, in response to execution, cause a computing device of a wireless sensor device to perform operations comprising: measuring, by a first sensor, a first temperature value at a skin surface on a patient body;
measuring, by a second sensor, a second temperature value of a sensor ambient air temperature at the first sensor;
determining a core body thermal exchange at the skin surface on the patient body using the first temperature value and the second temperature value;
determining the patient body temperature by using the core body thermal exchange;
controlling an absolute amplitude level of the core body thermal exchange; and outputting a patient body temperature.
17. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 16, further comprising: canceling, ambient temperature fluctuations from the skin temperature value by using an adaptive filter.
18. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 16, wherein the core body thermal exchange at the skin surface on the body is determined by subtracting an ambient filter output from the skin temperature value.
19. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 16, wherein the controlling the absolute amplitude level value of the core body thermal exchange includes subtracting an AC offset of the core body thermal exchange and adding a DC calibration value that transforms a time varying change of trend of the core body thermal exchange to an absolute scale comparable to standard patient temp measurement.
20. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 19, wherein the core body thermal exchange includes at least one of:
