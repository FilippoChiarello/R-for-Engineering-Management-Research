COMPRESSION AND DECOMPRESSION OF DOWNLINK CHANNEL ESTIMATES
</title>

<abstract>
A network node (501) determines parameters (503) indicating a compression function for compressing downlink channel estimates, and a decompression function. The network node transmits the parameters, receives compressed downlink channel estimates (504), and decompresses the compressed downlink channel estimates using the decompression function. A terminal device (502) receives the parameters, forms the compression function, compresses downlink channel estimates using the compression function, and transmits the compressed downlink channel estimates. The compression function comprises a first function formed based on at least some of the parameters, a second function which is non-linear, and a quantizer. The first function is configured to receive input data, and to reduce a dimension of the input data. The decompression function comprises a first function configured to receive input data and provide output data in a higher dimensional space than the input data, and a second function which is non-linear.
