METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PROCESSING DATA PACKAGES
</title>

<abstract>
A method for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package. The method comprises receiving a data package over a data network. The data package comprises a header and payload data. The header of the data package is analysed to determine a plurality of characteristics, the characteristics comprising at least an identifier and a transmission time. The method also comprises generating a risk indicator, wherein the risk indicator indicates a risk associated with the analysis of the header. A handling action is generated based on the risk indicator; and provided along with the payload data to the addressed recipient.

<claims>
1. A method (600) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package (100), the method comprising the steps of: receiving (610) a data package (100) over a data network (230), the data package (100) comprising a header (110) and payload data (120); analysing (620) the header (110) of the data package (100) to determine a plurality of characteristics, the characteristics comprising at least an identifier and a transmission time; generating (630) a risk indicator, the risk indicator indicating a risk associated with the analysis of the header (110); generating (640) a handling action based on the risk indicator; and providing (650) the payload data (120) and the handling action to the addressed recipient.
2. The method (600) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of the data package (100) according to claim 1, wherein the step of analysing (620) the header (110) comprises determining a relationship between the header (110) and at least one criterion.
3. The method (600) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package (100) according to claim 2, wherein the at least one criterion is a data model configured to output one or more probability values, and/or comprises one or more probability values.
4. The method (600) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package (100) according to claim 2, wherein the number of criteria used in the step of analysing (620) the header (110) is dependent on a plurality of data points associated with the identifier, such that the number of criteria used is based on at least one predefined relationship between the data points.
5. The method (600) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package (100) according to claim 4, wherein the predefined relationship is based on any of Monte Carlo data generation algorithm, a k-means clustering algorithm, a machine learning model, an expert system, or a peak finding algorithm.
6. The method (600) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package (100) according to claim 4, wherein if there are no data points associated with the identifier, data points relating to a domain associated with the identifier are used.
7. The method (600) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package (100) according to claim 1, wherein generating (630) the risk indicator comprises obtaining additional information from at least one additional data source and processing the additional information along with the analysis of the header (110).
8. The method (600) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package (100) according to claim 1, wherein generating (630) the risk indicator comprises at least one machine learning function.
9. The method (600) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package according to claim 1, further comprising the steps of: determining whether the payload data (120) of the data package (100) is encrypted; and decrypting the payload data (120) based on the handling action.
10. The method (600) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package (100) according to claim 1, wherein the handling action comprises a flag arranged to indicate at least the risk indicator to the addressed recipient.
11. A system (200) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package (100), the system comprising: storage (220) for storing a data package (100) received via a data network (230), the data package (100) comprising a header (110) and payload data (120); an analysis module (252) for analysing the header (110) of the data package (310) based on a plurality of characteristics, the characteristics comprising at least an identifier and a transmission time; a risk indication module (250) for generating a risk indicator, for indicating a risk associated with the analysis of the header (110); an action generation module (290) for generating a handling action based on the risk indicator; and an output module for providing the payload data (120) and the handling action to the addressed recipient.
12. The system (200) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package (100) according to claim 11, wherein the analysis module (252) determines a relationship between the header and at least one criterion.
13. The system (200) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package (100) according to claim 12, wherein the at least one criterion is a data model configured to output one or more probability values and/or comprises one or more probability values.
14. The system (200) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package (100) according to claim 12, wherein the number of criteria used by the analysis module (252) is dependent on a plurality of data points associated with the sender, such that the number of criteria used is based on at least one predefined relationship between the data points.
15. The system (200) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package (100) according to claim 14, wherein if there are no data points associated with the identifier, data points relating to a domain associated with the identifier are used.
16. The system (200) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package (100) according to claim 11, wherein the risk indication module (250) obtains additional information from at least one additional data source and processes the additional information along with the analysis of the header (110).
17. The system (200) for analysing data received by an addressed recipient of a data package (100) according to claim 11, wherein the analysis module (252) comprises a processor.
