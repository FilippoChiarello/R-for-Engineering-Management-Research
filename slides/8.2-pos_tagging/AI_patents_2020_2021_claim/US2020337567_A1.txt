<claims>
1. 1-3. (canceled)
4. A detection and classification system, the system comprising: a sensor module configured to receive a signal; a feature detection module configured to receive the signal and to analyze the signal for repeating segments; and a signal feature classifier configured to receive the signal and information regarding repeating segments therein from the feature detection module and to classify the signal, wherein the system is configured to automatically notify a predetermined third-party of the occurrence of a predetermined classification.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the signal is an ECG signal, the feature detection module comprises a beat detection module, and the signal feature classifier comprises a beat classifier.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the beat detection module is configured to detect a QRS complex.
7. The system of claim 4, wherein the signal is a biometric signal.
8. The system of claim 4, wherein the feature detection module and the signal feature classifier are configured to receive the signal simultaneously.
9. The system of claim 4, wherein the signal classification is selected from the group consisting of normal, abnormal, and critical.
10. The system of claim 4, further comprising a derived feature detection module configured to further analyze the information generated by the feature detection module.
11. The system of claim 4, further comprising filters disposed between the sensor module and elements configured to receive the signal therefrom, wherein said features are configured to strip irrelevant information from the signal.
12. The system of claim 4, further comprising biometric sensors, wherein information therefrom is analyzed in parallel with information provided by the signal feature classifier to provide a more complete picture of a patient's overall well-being
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the information obtained from the biometric sensors is also taken into account by the feature classifier during signal classification.
14. The system of claim 4, wherein said system is further configured to transmit data upon which the classification was based with said notification.
15. The system of claim 4, wherein the signal is down-sampled before being provided to the feature detection module and the signal feature classifier.
16. The system of claim 4 wherein the signal feature classifier is further configured to establish a baseline characterization of patient response.
17. The system of claim 4 wherein the signal is ergodic.
18. A wearable detection and classification system, the system comprising: a unitary housing configured to be worn by a patient, the unitary housing comprising: an ECG sensor module configured to receive an ECG signal; an ECG signal filter configured to process the received ECG signal; a beat detection module configured to receive the processed ECG signal and to analyze the ECG signal for repeating segments; a plurality of biometric sensors configured to acquire biometric data; and a beat classifier configured to receive the processed ECG signal and information regarding repeating segments therein from the beat detection module, biometric data from at least one of the plurality of biometric sensors, and to classify the ECG signal as normal or abnormal based on this information, wherein the system is configured to create an individualized model of the patient's ECG signal that establishes a baseline for the patient and to use this individualized model to classify an ECG signal as normal or abnormal, wherein the repeating segments are QRS complexes, wherein the system is configured to assign a score to a classification based on how closely it matches a particular model, and wherein the system is configured to automatically notify a predetermined third-party of the occurrence of an abnormal classification and its associated score.
19. The system of claim 18 wherein the individualized model is automatically created by the system using machine learning techniques, including a supervised learning phase requiring human assistance and an unsupervised learning phase wherein at least one machine learning algorithm and/or technique is used to draw inferences from datasets comprising individual sensor data, including raw ECG signal and derived feature information, without labeled responses, and wherein the individualized model comprises personalized alterations to the behavior of the beat detector and beat classifier.
20. The system of claim 18 wherein machine learning comprises the application of non-parametric Bayesian methods that make use of infinite-dimensional mathematical structures.
21. The system of claim 18 wherein processing and analyzing of the ECG signal is performed by a computing resource external to the unitary housing.
22. The system of claim 18 wherein at least two of the unitary housings configured to be worn by a patient are worn by a single patient, wherein said at least two unitary housings are used and configured to gather overlapping information, and wherein the system is further configured to compared data generated by each unitary housing and identify and omit or average erroneous data.
23. The system of claim 18 further comprising a function button disposed on an exterior portion of the unitary housing and configured to cause data to be transmitted to the predetermined third-party upon activation, as if an abnormal classification had been encountered.
