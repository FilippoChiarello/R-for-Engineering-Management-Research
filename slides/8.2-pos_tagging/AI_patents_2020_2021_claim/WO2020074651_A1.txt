<title>
FREE TEXT DE-IDENTIFICATION
</title>

<abstract>
A system or method generates de-identified output from a data set of patient data comprising unstructured text (100) in natural language phrases. A blacklist (105) has word items that are not allowed. The unstructured text is processed to determine a word count (110) comprising a list of low-rate word items that have a number of occurrences (k) in the unstructured text below a threshold (120). Subsequently, the low-rate word items and the blacklist word items are masked (130) in the unstructured text to generate the de-identified output (140).

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for generating de-identified output from a data set of patient data of multiple patients,
the patient data comprising unstructured text (100), the unstructured text comprising word items of words, numbers and symbols arranged in natural language phrases, and
a blacklist (105) comprising blacklist word items that are not allowed in the de-identified output,
the method comprising the steps of:
processing the unstructured text to determine a word count (110) comprising a list of low-rate word items that have a number of occurrences (k) in the unstructured text below a threshold (120), and
removing or masking (130) the low-rate word items and the blacklist word items in the unstructured text to generate the de-identified output (140).
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the processing comprises setting the threshold above a minimum threshold in dependence of a desired percentage of the unstructured text that is allowed in the de-identified output.
3. The method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the method comprises determining, as word items, separate word items for a same word having different syntactic positions in the phrases.
4. The method according to any of the claims 1 to 3, wherein the method comprises determining, as word items, word patterns, a word pattern comprising in a phrase at least one word in combination with an adjacent pattern of numbers or symbols.
5. The method according to any of the claims 1 to 4, wherein the method comprises determining, as word items, word strings, a word string comprising a specific sequence of words.
6. The method according to any of the claims 1 to 5, wherein the method comprises determining, as word items, word stems, a word stem comprising a set of different words having a similar semantic function in different phrases.
7. The method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the processing comprises determining the blacklist using the word items as claimed in any of the claims 3 to 5.
8. The method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the processing comprises determining the word count using the word items as claimed in any of the claims 3 to 6.
9. The method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the processing comprises
determining a whitelist comprising word items that are allowed in the deidentified output, and
preventing said removing or masking the low-rate word items by allowing in the de-identified output low-rate word items that are in the whitelist.
10. The method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the processing comprises
determining a confidence list comprising a confidence score for confidence word items based on word count results in previous de-identification events, and
adapting the word count for the confidence word items by adjusting, in dependence of the confidence score, the number of occurrences (k) or the threshold.
11. The method according to claim 10, wherein the confidence score represents in a percentage how many times the confidence word item was above the threshold in the word count in the previous de-identification events.
12. A computer program product for generating de-identified output from a data set of patient data of multiple patients, the computer program product comprising instructions which when carried out on a computer cause the computer to perform a method as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 11.
13. A system (1100) for generating de-identified output from a data set of patient data of multiple patients, the system comprising:
a data interface (1126) configured to receive patient data of multiple patients, the patient data comprising unstructured text (100), the unstructured text comprising word items of words, numbers and symbols arranged in natural language phrases, and
a blacklist (105) comprising blacklist word items that are not allowed in the de-identified output; and
a processor (1130) arranged to:
process the unstructured text to determine a word count (110) comprising a list of low-rate word items that have a number of occurrences (k) in the unstructured text below a threshold (120), and
remove or mask (130) the low-rate word items and the blacklist word items in the unstructured text to generate the de-identified output (140). 14. Use of the method according to any one of claims 1 to 11, the computer program product according to claim 12 and/or the system according to claim 13 in one selected from the group consisting of genomics, genetics, bioinformatics research, transcriptomics, proteomics and systems biology or diagnosis.
