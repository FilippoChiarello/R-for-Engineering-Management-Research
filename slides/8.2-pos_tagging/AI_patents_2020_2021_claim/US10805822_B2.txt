Method and apparatus for supporting measurement reporting enhancement for aerial device in wireless communication system
</title>

<abstract>
A method and apparatus for supporting a measurement reporting enhancement for an aerial device in a wireless communication system is provided. A prohibit timer can be used in order to prohibit frequent measurement reporting, and the prohibit timer may be stopped when a leaving condition for the measurement reporting is satisfied and/or a handover procedure and/or a radio resource control (RRC) connection re-establishment procedure is performed.

<claims>
1. A method performed by a wireless device in a wireless communication system, the method comprising: triggering an event for measurement reporting upon an entering condition for the measurement reporting being satisfied for at least one cell; performing the measurement reporting for the at least one cell; starting a prohibit timer for the at least one cell upon the wireless device moving above an altitude threshold configured by a network, wherein the measurement reporting for the at least one cell is prohibited while the prohibit timer for the at least one cell is running; stopping the prohibit timer for the at least one cell upon a leaving condition for the measurement reporting being satisfied for the at least one cell; and triggering the event for the measurement reporting and performing the measurement reporting for the at least one cell after stopping the prohibit timer for the at least one cell, wherein the leaving condition includes a condition that the at least one cell, for which the measurement reporting is prohibited while the prohibit timer for the at least one cell is running, is set to have a measurement identity and there is no more measurement reporting entry for a relevant measurement identity for the leaving condition.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the leaving condition includes a prohibited target being set for a measurement event and there is no more measurement reporting entry for a relevant measurement event for the leaving condition.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the wireless device is in communication with at least one of a user equipment, a network, and/or an autonomous vehicle other than the wireless device.
4. A wireless device in a wireless communication system, the wireless device comprising: a memory; a transceiver; and a processor, operably coupled to the memory and the transceiver, and configured to: trigger an event for measurement reporting upon an entering condition for the measurement reporting being satisfied for at least one cell; perform the measurement reporting for the at least one cell; start a prohibit timer for the at least one cell upon the wireless device moving above an altitude threshold configured by a network, wherein the measurement reporting for the at least one cell is prohibited while the prohibit timer for the at least one cell is running; stop the prohibit timer for the at least one cell upon a leaving condition for the measurement reporting being satisfied for the at least one cell; trigger the event for the measurement reporting and performing the measurement reporting for the at least one cell after stopping the prohibit timer for the at least one cell; wherein the leaving condition includes a condition that the at least one cell, for which the measurement reporting is prohibited while the prohibit timer for the at least one cell is running, is set to have a measurement identity and there is no more measurement reporting entry for a relevant measurement identity for the leaving condition.
