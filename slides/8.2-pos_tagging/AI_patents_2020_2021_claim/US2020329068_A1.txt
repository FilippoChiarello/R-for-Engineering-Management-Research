SECURITY THREAT INFORMATION GATHERING AND INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEMS AND METHODS
</title>

<abstract>
A common misconception equates information with intelligence. To transform information into intelligence a number of analytical steps must occur within a framework designed to yield very specific datum associable with other raw or formulated datum, that provides an answer or solution to a sub-problem. Every organization has threats and risks including cyber threats, threats to infrastructure, etc. that can impact the organization on many levels. However, most organizations do not understand how to quantify and assess these risks/threats yet alone assess different preemptive actions for mitigating impact. It would therefore be beneficial to provide organizations with a software based system that provides threat information gathering, incident reporting, and asset identification/valuation as part of its compounded intelligence and supports predictive context specific analysis of risks and countermeasures. Further, distributed countermeasure monitoring provides incident levels of known and unknown, or yet to be categorized threats.
