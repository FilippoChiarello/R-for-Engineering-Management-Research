DOWNHOLE AND NEAR WELLBORE RESERVOIR STATE INFERENCE THROUGH AUTOMATED INVERSE WELLBORE FLOW MODELING
</title>

<abstract>
A method to estimate the likely downhole conditions in the wellbore and reservoir by Inverse modeling well flow simulation history matched with field sensor data. The invention presents a method for automating sensor data processing through cleaning, transformation, and identification of stable states. This process is crucial for the selection of data to be simulated and matched without human review. The matched simulations are subjected to a state-space model in order to assign a probability to a given unknown state. This probability is updated at each time step. As the well undergoes transition over time including decline, the drift of the likely state of operation is orchestrated to allow physically constrained movement to a proximate space. Based on the extent of repetition and overlap between similar states as they transition over several time steps, the confidence of the inverse model increases, thus narrowing down the likely domain and trajectory of operation and boosting the probability of this narrowed zone. The knowledge of downhole and near wellbore reservoir zone is essential for better modeling, understanding of the wells and decision making in the oilfield. This knowledge may be obtained through well testing but involves physical intervention that can involve expense and production loss. It is also less common to have such well tests being performed at a daily, weekly or even monthly basis so timely information is generally not available. This invention provides a mechanism to have a live update of such information without any physical intervention.

<claims>
1. A method of improving performance of a well, comprising: step 1—using sensor data to identify a first period of time during which a value of downhole condition (field data) is stable; step 2—using (a) the stable period and (b) first surface data to generate probabilities for possible values for the downhole condition; step 3—matching at least some of the possible values with historical production data, and using probabilistic inverse modeling to estimate likelihoods of at least some of the matched possible values with historical production data; step 4—repeating steps 1-3 for at least a second period of time, and estimating a drift from at least first and second periods of time; step 5—using the drift and second surface data to predict that implementation of a selected one or more of the possible values will improve performance of the well; and step 6—implementing the at least one or more selected values in operation of the well.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the sensor data is at least partially historical.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the sensor data is at least partially live.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein steps 1-4 of the method are completely automated
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of using sensor data to identify a first period of time further comprises eliminating noise from the field data.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of matching further comprises incorporating a change in at least one of an artificial lift setpoint and a transitionary state.
