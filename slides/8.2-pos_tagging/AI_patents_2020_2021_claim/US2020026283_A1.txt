AUTONOMOUS ROUTE DETERMINATION
</title>

<abstract>
A method (1300) of generating a training dataset for use in autonomous route determination, the method comprising obtaining (1302) data from a data collection vehicle (10) driven through an environment. The data comprises vehicle odometry data detailing a path taken by the vehicle (10) through the environment, obstacle sensing data detailing obstacles detected in the environment; and images (106) of the environment. The method (1300) further comprises using (1304) the obstacle sensing data to label one or more portions of at least some of the images (108) as obstacles and using (1306) the vehicle odometry data to label one or more portions of at least some of the images (108) as the path taken by the vehicle (10) through the environment.

<claims>
1. A method of generating a training dataset for use in autonomous route determination, the method comprising: obtaining data from a data collection vehicle driven through an environment, the data comprising: vehicle odometry data detailing a path taken by the vehicle through the environment, obstacle sensing data detailing obstacles detected in the environment; and images of the environment; using the obstacle sensing data to label one or more portions of at least some of the images as obstacles; using the vehicle odometry data to label one or more portions of at least some of the images as the path taken by the vehicle through the environment; and creating the training data set from the labelled images.
2. The method according to claim 1 wherein the training dataset is used to inform a route planner, typically of an autonomous guided vehicle.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the training dataset is used to train a segmentation framework to predict routes likely to be driven by a driver within an image for use in a route planner.
4. The method according to claim 2 wherein a vehicle is controlled according to a route generated by the route planner.
5. The method of claim 1 further comprising labelling any remainder of each image as an unknown area.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein points of contact between the vehicle and the ground are known with respect to the visual images and used to identify the path along which the vehicle was driven through the environment.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein the images are photographs.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein no manual labelling of the images, nor manual seeding of labels for the images, is required, and optionally wherein no manual labelling, nor manual seeding, is performed.
9. The method of claim 1 wherein the vehicle odometry data is provided by at least one of the following systems, the system being onboard the data collection vehicle: (i) a stereo visual odometry system; (ii) an inertial odometry system; (iii) a wheel odometry system; (iv) LIDAR; and/or (v) a Global Navigation Satellite System, such as GPS.
10. The method of claim 1 wherein the obstacle sensing data is provided by at least one of the following systems, the system being onboard the data collection vehicle: (i) a LIDAR scanner; (ii) automotive radar; and/or (iii) stereo vision.
11. A training dataset for use in autonomous route determination, the training dataset comprising a set of labelled images labelled by the method of claim 1.
12. Use of the training dataset of claim 11 in training a segmentation unit for autonomous route determination, wherein the segmentation unit is taught to identify a path within an image that would be likely to be chosen by a driver, and optionally to identify regions containing obstacles.
13. A segmentation unit trained for autonomous route determination using the training dataset of claim 11, wherein the segmentation unit is taught to identify a path within an image that would be likely to be chosen by a driver, and optionally to identify regions containing obstacles.
14. The segmentation unit of claim 13, wherein the segmentation unit is a semantic segmentation network.
15. Use of the trained segmentation unit of claim 13 for autonomous route determination, optionally including segmentation of regions containing obstacles.
16. An autonomous vehicle comprising: a segmentation unit according to claim 13; and a sensor arranged to capture images of an environment around the autonomous vehicle; wherein a route of the autonomous vehicle through the environment is determined by the segmentation unit using images captured by the sensor.
17. The autonomous vehicle of claim 16 wherein the only sensor used by the autonomous vehicle for route determination is a monocular camera.
18. A non-transitory machine readable medium containing instructions which, when read by a machine, cause that machine to perform segmentation and labelling of images of an environment, including: using vehicle odometry data detailing a path taken by a vehicle through the environment to identify and label one or more portions of at least some of the images as the path taken by the vehicle through the environment; and using obstacle sensing data detailing obstacles detected in the environment to identify and label one or more portions of at least some of the images as obstacles.
19. A method of controlling an autonomous vehicle comprising: training a segmentation framework using a training dataset, wherein the training dataset is generated by processing data comprising: test vehicle odometry data detailing a path taken by a test vehicle through the environment, obstacle sensing data detailing obstacles detected in the environment; and images of the environment; the processing comprising: using the obstacle sensing data to label one or more portions of at least some of the images as obstacles; using the test vehicle odometry data to label one or more portions of at least some of the images as the path taken by the test vehicle through the environment; creating the training dataset from the labelled images; using the training dataset to train the segmentation framework; using the trained segmentation framework to inform a route planner of the autonomous vehicle; and using the route planner to generate routes for the autonomous vehicle to follow.
