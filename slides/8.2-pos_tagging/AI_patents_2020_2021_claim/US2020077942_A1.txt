The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one body sensor further includes a respiration sensor, an electrooculography sensor, a body weight sensor, a movement sensor, an electromyography sensor, a brain wave sensor, a body temperature sensor, an analyte sensor, a pulse oximeter sensor, a blood pressure sensor, an electrodermal activity sensor, and/or a body fat sensor.
3. The system of claim 1, further comprising at least one environmental sensor, wherein the at least one environmental sensor includes a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, a noise sensor, an air quality sensor, a light sensor, a motion sensor, a barometric sensor, and/or a camera.
4. The system of claim 1, further comprising a mattress with adjustable firmness and/or elevation; a mattress pad, a blanket, and/or a mattress with adjustable surface temperature; an alarm clock; a humidifier; a dehumidifier; a pulsed electromagnetic field device; a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation device; a sound generator; an air purifier; a scent generator; red and/or near-infrared lighting; a lighting system; a fan; a sunrise simulator; and/or a sunset simulator.
5. The system of claim 1, further comprising a home automation system, wherein the at least one remote device is operable to transmit commands to the home automation system to adjust environmental conditions.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one remote device is operable to recognize an emotion and/or classify at least one health state or condition based on a voice sample from a user.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein a camera on the at least one remote device is operable to scan a room and/or a sleeping environment, and wherein the at least one remote device is operable to provide feedback to a user and/or suggest at least one intervention or at least one change to the room and/or the sleeping environment to reduce stress and/or promote sleep.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one remote device is further operable to use an image of a user to estimate a gender, an age, a body mass index (BMI) for the user, and/or detect an emotion from a facial expression in the image of the user.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the chronotype is determined by a body temperature sensor or at least one genetic test.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one group relates to the chronotype, a diet, a fitness type, an intervention, an influencer, a coach, a health condition, a predisposition to a health condition, an age, a relationship status, a location, a parental status, a gender, a medication, a supplement, and/or a degree of willingness to accept alternative medicine.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one body sensor and the at least one remote device are in real-time or near-real-time two-way communication.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one remote device is operable to schedule at least one event or task based on the chronotype.
13. A system to reduce stress and promote sleep comprising: at least one remote device; at least one remote server; and at least one body sensor, wherein the at least one body sensor includes a heart rate sensor; wherein the at least one remote device is in network communication with the at least one remote server, and the at least one body sensor; wherein the at least one remote device collects body sensor data from the at least one body sensor; wherein the at least one remote device analyzes the body sensor data, thereby creating analyzed body sensor data; wherein the analyzed body sensor data includes at least a resting heart rate and a heart rate variability; wherein the at least one remote device is operable to estimate sleep stages from the body sensor data and/or the analyzed body sensor data; wherein the at least one remote device stores a chronotype for a user; wherein the at least one remote device classifies a user into at least one group based on a user profile, the body sensor data, and/or user provided information; wherein the at least one remote server is operable to run at least one algorithm to suggest at least one intervention to the user to reduce stress and/or promote sleep based on the user profile, the body sensor data, the analyzed body sensor data, and the user provided information; and wherein the at least one intervention includes automatically adjusting a temperature of a sleeping surface using a mattress, a mattress pad, and/or a blanket.
