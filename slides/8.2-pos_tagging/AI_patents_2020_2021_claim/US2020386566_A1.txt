SELF-POSITION SHARING SYSTEM, VEHICLE, AND TERMINAL
</title>

<abstract>
A terminal in a self-position sharing system that is installed in a vehicle and is capable of communicating with the vehicle includes a measurement device that measures a self-position of the terminal. Further, the vehicle in the self-position sharing system includes: a processor configured to estimate a self-position of the vehicle with measurement accuracy higher than that of the terminal at a predetermined period, determine whether or not measurement accuracy of a self-position by the terminal decreases, set a notification frequency of notifying the terminal of an estimated self-position of the vehicle to a first frequency when the measurement accuracy does not decrease, set the notification frequency to a second frequency higher than the first frequency when the measurement accuracy decreases; and notify the terminal of an estimated self-position of the vehicle with the set notification frequency.

<claims>
1. A self-position sharing system comprising: a vehicle; and a terminal installed in the vehicle and capable of communicating with the vehicle, wherein the terminal includes a measurement device that measures a self-position of the terminal, and the vehicle includes: a processor configured to: estimate the self-position of the vehicle with measurement accuracy higher than measurement accuracy of the terminal at a predetermined period; determine whether or not measurement accuracy of the self-position by the terminal decreases; set a notification frequency of notifying the terminal of an estimated self-position of the vehicle to a first frequency when the measurement accuracy does not decrease; set the notification frequency to a second frequency higher than the first frequency when the measurement accuracy decreases; and notify the terminal of the estimated self-position of the vehicle with the notification frequency being set among the first frequency and the second frequency.
2. The self-position sharing system according to claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to determine whether or not a distance between a point at which a traveling state of the vehicle is changed and the vehicle is equal to or less than a predetermined distance, and set the notification frequency to a third frequency higher than the first frequency when the distance is equal to or less than the predetermined distance and the measurement accuracy decreases.
3. The self-position sharing system according to claim 1, wherein the terminal further includes: a memory that stores map information, a display device, and a controller that displays, on the display device, the estimated self-position of the vehicle notified from the vehicle together with a lane of a road represented in the map information in which the vehicle is traveling.
4. A self-position sharing system comprising: a vehicle; and a terminal installed in the vehicle and capable of communicating with the vehicle, wherein the vehicle includes: a processor configured to estimate a self-position of the vehicle at a predetermined period, and notify the terminal of an estimated self-position of the vehicle, and the terminal includes: a measurement device that measures the self-position of the terminal with measurement accuracy lower than measurement accuracy of the vehicle, and a controller that sets a frequency of measuring the self-position by the measurement device when the estimated self-position of the vehicle is notified from the vehicle to be lower than a frequency of measuring the self-position by the measurement device when the estimated self-position of the vehicle is not notified from the vehicle.
5. The self-position sharing system according to claim 4, wherein the terminal further includes an electric power supply device that supplies electric power to the terminal, and the controller of the terminal sets a frequency of measuring the self-position by the measurement device only when the estimated self-position of the vehicle is notified from the vehicle and an electric power remaining quantity of the electric power supply device is equal to or less than a predetermined remaining quantity threshold value to be lower than a frequency of measuring the self-position by the measurement device when the estimated self-position of the vehicle is not notified from the vehicle.
6. The self-position sharing system according to claim 4, wherein the controller of the terminal sets a frequency of measuring the self-position by the measurement device only when the estimated self-position of the vehicle is notified from the vehicle and a temperature of the terminal is equal to or higher than a predetermined temperature threshold value to be lower than a frequency of measuring the self-position by the measurement device when the estimated self-position of the vehicle is not notified from the vehicle.
7. The self-position sharing system according to claim 4, wherein the terminal further includes: a memory that stores map information, and a display device, wherein the controller displays, on the display device, the estimated self-position of the vehicle notified from the vehicle together with a lane of a road represented in the map information in which the vehicle is traveling.
8. A vehicle in which a terminal capable of measuring a self-position is installed, comprising: a processor configured to: estimate the self-position of the vehicle with measurement accuracy higher than measurement accuracy of the terminal at a predetermined period; determine whether or not measurement accuracy of the self-position by the terminal decreases; set a notification frequency of notifying the terminal of an estimated self-position of the vehicle to a first frequency when the measurement accuracy does not decrease; set the notification frequency to a second frequency higher than the first frequency when the measurement accuracy decreases; and notify the terminal of the estimated self-position of the vehicle with the notification frequency being set among the first frequency and the second frequency.
9. A terminal that is installed in a vehicle capable of estimating a self-position at a predetermined period and is capable of communicating with the vehicle, comprising: a measurement device that measures the self-position of the terminal with measurement accuracy lower than measurement accuracy of the vehicle; and a controller that sets a frequency of measuring the self-position by the measurement device when an estimated self-position of the vehicle is notified from the vehicle to be lower than a frequency of measuring the self-position by the measurement device when the estimated self-position of the vehicle is not notified from the vehicle.
