Method for detecting abnormal game play
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a method for determining an abnormal game play. Operations stored in a computer program for processing the method include: computing a game play scene of a player using an abnormal game play determination model which includes one or more network functions; determining whether an abnormal pattern exists in the game play scene based on an output of the abnormal game play determination model; and determining whether a play of the player is abnormally performed based on whether an abnormal pattern exists in the game play scene.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A non-transitory computer readable medium storing a computer program, wherein when the computer program is executed by one or more processors of a computing device, the computer program performs operations for determining abnormal game play, and the operations include: computing a game play scene of a player using an abnormal game play determination model which includes one or more network functions; determining whether an abnormal pattern exists in the game play scene based on an output of the abnormal game play determination model; and determining whether a play of the player is abnormally performed based on whether an abnormal pattern exists in the game play scene.
2. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 1, wherein the game play scene is at least a part of a game play image obtained with respect to game play of the player, and is generated based on at least one of a predetermined action or a predetermined time unit.
3. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 1, wherein the game play scene includes at least one of an entire game play scene displayed to the player, at least a part of a game play scene determined based on a genre of a game, at least a part of a game play scene determined based on a game data or at least a part excluding a game information from a game play scene.
4. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 1, wherein the abnormal game play determination model is trained with a first training data set composed of a normal game play scene to identify a pattern of a normal game play scene related to a normal game play, and detects whether an untrained pattern exists in the game play scene.
5. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 4, wherein the abnormal game play determination model trains color pattern of a normal game play scene using the first training data set, and detects abnormal game play based on whether the untrained color pattern exists in the game play scene.
6. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 4, wherein the abnormal game play determination model trains edge of an object of a normal game play scene using the first training data set, and detects abnormal game play based on whether the untrained edge pattern of an object exists in the game play scene.
7. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 4, wherein the abnormal game play determination model trains an object of a normal game play scene and a color pattern of the object of the normal game play scene using the first training data set, and detects abnormal game play based on whether the untrained color pattern of the object exists on the game play scene.
8. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 1, wherein the abnormal game play determination model is trained with a second training data set including an abnormal game play scene to identify a pattern of an abnormal game play scene related to an abnormal game play, and detects whether a trained abnormal pattern exists in the game play scene.
9. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 8, wherein the second training data set includes training data labeled as an abnormal object of the abnormal game play scene.
10. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 1, wherein the abnormal game play determination model extracts a positional information of an abnormal pattern on the game play scene, and detects abnormal game play based on a result of comparison between the positional information of the abnormal pattern and a game data.
11. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 1, wherein the abnormal game play determination model includes one or more abnormal game play determination submodels, wherein the one or more abnormal game play determination submodel are trained to detect an abnormal pattern for each object which is identified with a third training data set, based on one or more objects included in a normal game play scene related to a normal game play, the third training data set includes a third training data subset composed of each normal object, detects one or more objects of the game play scene, and detects whether an untrained pattern exists in each of the objects by calculating each of the detected objects through the abnormal game play determination submodel.
12. A method for determining abnormal game play, comprising: computing a game play scene of a player using an abnormal game play determination model which includes one or more network functions; determining whether an abnormal pattern exists in the game play scene based on an output of the abnormal game play determination model; and determining whether a play of the player is abnormally performed based on whether an abnormal pattern exists in the game play scene.
13. A server for determining abnormal game play, comprising: a server including one or more cores; and a memory; wherein the processor is configured to: compute a game play scene of a player using an abnormal game play determination model which includes one or more network functions; determine whether an abnormal pattern exists in the game play scene based on an output of the abnormal game play determination model; and determine whether a play of the player is abnormally performed based on whether an abnormal pattern exists in the game play scene.
