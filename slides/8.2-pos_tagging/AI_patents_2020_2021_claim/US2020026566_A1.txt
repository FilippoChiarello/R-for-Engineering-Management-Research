<title>
Workload identification and display of workload-specific metrics
</title>

<abstract>
An architecture for implementing a mechanism for automatically displaying metrics specific to a type of workload being processed by a computer system is provided. The mechanism predicts a classification of the workload based on attributes that characterize the workload using a set of workload profiles and/or a set of classification rules that correlate different combinations of attributes of workloads with different classifications of workloads. Based on the predicted classification of the workload, one or more templates including one or more metrics specific to the classification of workload are identified. The template(s) including the metric(s) specific to the classification of the workload may be identified using set of rules that associate the metric(s) with the predicted classification of the workload. A user interface including the metric(s) is generated based on the template(s). The user interface may then be displayed to a user of the computer system.
