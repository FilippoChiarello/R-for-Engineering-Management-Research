<title>
METHOD FOR VERIFYING THE PRODUCTION PROCESS OF FIELD DEVICES BY MEANS OF A MACHINE-LEARNING SYSTEM OR OF A PROGNOSIS SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to a method for verifying the production process of field devices, including a step of accessing a service platform on which data from field devices, including identification data, the respective type of field device, configuration data, containing application-specific data, environment information of the field devices or parameter data, data relating to the production date of a respective field device and repair or troubleshooting cases of the field devices are stored. The method also includes steps of detecting anomalies by statistically evaluating the repair or troubleshooting cases stored on service platform and creating a notification in the event of a detected anomaly, supplying the data of the field devices and the notifications to a machine learning or prognosis system, and evaluating the data of the field devices and the notifications by means of the machine learning or prognosis system for forecasting series errors of the field devices.

<claims>
1. A method for verifying the production process of field devices of automation technology, comprising: accessing a service platform on which data from field devices, including identification data, the respective type of field device, configuration data, containing application-specific data, environment information of the field devices or parameter data, data relating to the production date of a respective field device and repair or troubleshooting cases of the field devices are stored in a correlated manner; detecting anomalies by statistically evaluating the repair or troubleshooting cases stored on the service platform and creating a notification in the event of a detected anomaly; supplying the data of the field devices and the notifications to a machine learning or prognosis system; and evaluating the data of the field devices and the notifications by means of the machine learning or prognosis system for forecasting series errors of the field devices.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning or prognosis system additionally predicts a probable point in time of an occurrence of a functional incapacity or a serious error case at the corresponding field devices.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning or prognosis system learns defined types of series errors by means of an expert system.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein, after learning, the machine learning or prognosis system predicts the defined types of series errors and new types of series errors by evaluating the data of the field devices and the notifications.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the machine learning or prognosis system calculates an index for each predicted series error, which index represents a measure of the probability of the predicted series error.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning or prognosis system uses a neural network.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning or prognosis system is integrated on the service platform.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning or prognosis system is integrated on a further service platform.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the service platform or the further service platform are embedded in a cloud architecture and can be contacted via the Internet.
