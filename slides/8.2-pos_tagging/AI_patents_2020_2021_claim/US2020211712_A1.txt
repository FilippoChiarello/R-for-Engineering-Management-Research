COMPUTER-AIDED RECOGNITION SYSTEM FOR TREATMENT RESPONSE OF RECTAL CANCER, AND ITS METHOD AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-aided recognition system for treatment response of rectal cancer is provided to predict the probability of a pathological complete response (pCR) of a rectal cancer patient after preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The system includes a random forest model having several decision trees. Each decision tree has at least a feature node. Each feature node generates two branches according to a feature threshold, wherein each branch connects to another feature node or corresponds to an elementary pCR predicting probability. The random forest model integrates the elementary pCR probability of each decision tree, so as to generate a final pCR probability.
