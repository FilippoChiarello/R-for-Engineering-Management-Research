SYSTEM AND METHOD OF MEASURING BODY FLUIDS
</title>

<abstract>
A method of measuring body fluid content, the method comprising computer executed steps, the steps comprising: receiving a value of a temperature of a body part of a subject, and generating corrective data based on the received measured temperature value and on previously gathered data, the corrective data being usable for correcting a measurement of content of a fluid sample taken from the body part.

<claims>
1. 1.-30. (canceled)
31. A method of measuring body fluid content, the method comprising computer executed steps, the steps comprising: measuring content of a fluid sample taken from a subject; receiving a measured value of a temperature of a body part of the subject; generating corrective data based on the received measured temperature value and on previously gathered data; and correcting a result of said measuring of the content of the fluid sample taken from the subject, using the generated corrective data.
32. The method of claim 31, wherein said correcting comprises replacing the result of said measuring of the content with a range of values based on the corrective data.
33. The method of claim 31, wherein said correcting comprises changing the result of said measuring of the content when the result is not within a range of values based on the corrective data.
34. The method of claim 31, wherein said generating of the corrective data is based on data received from a computer in communication with a device used for said measuring of the content of the fluid sample.
35. The method of claim 34, further comprising forwarding the measured value of the temperature of the body part of the subject to the computer that is in communication with the device, wherein the data received from the computer that is in communication with the device, is data generated on the computer that is in communication with the device, based on the measured temperature value.
36. The method of claim 31, wherein the previously gathered data comprises for each one of a plurality of previously taken test samples, a respective temperature value measured when taking the test sample and a respective content value measured using the test sample.
37. The method of claim 31, wherein the previously gathered data comprises for each one of a plurality of previously taken test samples, a respective temperature value measured when taking the test sample, a respective content value measured using the test sample, and a respective time indication.
38. The method of claim 31, wherein the previously gathered data comprises for each one of a plurality of previously taken test samples, a respective temperature value measured when taking the test sample, a respective content value measured using the test sample, and an at least one other parameter value.
39. The method of claim 31, further comprising taking the fluid sample from the body part of the subject.
40. The method of claim 31, further comprising receiving biometric data taken from the body part of the subject.
41. The method of claim 31, wherein the body part is a finger of the subject, the method further comprising receiving fingerprint data taken from the body part of the subject.
42. The method of claim 31, further comprising generating disease progress data based on the previously gathered data.
43. The method of claim 42, wherein said generating of the disease progress data is based on data received from a computer in communication with a device used for said measuring of the content of the fluid sample.
44. The method of claim 31, further comprising a preliminary step of changing the temperature of the body part into a predetermined value prior to taking the fluid sample from the body part.
45. The method of claim 31, further comprising capturing an image of the body part.
46. The method of claim 31, further comprising using an image of the body part, for guiding a user when taking the fluid sample.
47. The method of claim 31, wherein the body part is a finger, the method further comprising analyzing an image of the finger, and guiding a user when taking the fluid sample from the finger, based on said analyzing.
48. The method of claim 31, wherein the body part is a finger, the method further comprising analyzing an image of the finger, and advising a user to take the fluid sample from another finger, based on said analyzing.
49. A non-transitory computer readable medium storing computer executable instructions for performing steps of measuring body fluid content, the steps comprising: measuring content of a fluid sample taken from a subject; receiving a measured value of a temperature of a body part of the subject; generating corrective data based on the received measured temperature value and on previously gathered data; and correcting a result of said measuring of the content of the fluid sample taken from the subject, using the generated corrective data.
50. A method of assisting body fluid content measurement, the method comprising computer executed steps, the steps comprising: by a computer in communication with a device used to measure content of a fluid sample of a subject, receiving a measured temperature value of a body part of the subject; generating corrective data based on the received measured temperature value and on previously gathered data, the corrective data being usable for correcting a result of measuring of the content of the fluid sample; and sending the corrective data to the device, for the device to use for said correcting.
51. A non-transitory computer readable medium storing computer executable instructions for performing steps of assisting body fluid content measurement, the steps comprising: by a computer in communication with a device used to measure content of a fluid sample of a subject, receiving a measured temperature value of a body part of the subject; generating corrective data based on the received measured temperature value and on previously gathered data, the corrective data being usable for correcting a result of measuring of the content of the fluid sample; and sending the corrective data to the device, for the device to use for said correcting.
