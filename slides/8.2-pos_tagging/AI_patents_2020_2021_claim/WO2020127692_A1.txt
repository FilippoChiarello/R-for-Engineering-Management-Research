<title>
A SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MONITORING BACTERIAL GROWTH OF BACTERIAL COLONIES AND PREDICTING COLONY BIOMASS
</title>

<abstract>
An imaging method for earliest microbial growth detection. The method uses images to determined colony biomass, and the colony biomass determines when the colony can be picked for analysis for identification or antibiotic susceptibility testing. If the sample source is not a pure sample source additional incubation may be required to permit an increase in biomass of the colonies prior to pick.

1. An automated method for evaluating microbial growth on plated media, the method comprising:
providing a culture media inoculated with a biological sample disposed in a container that is substantially optically transparent;
incubating the inoculated culture media in an incubator;
placing the substantially optically transparent container carrying the inoculated culture media in a digital imaging apparatus;
obtaining a first digital image of the inoculated culture media at a first time (t0), the first digital image having a plurality of pixels;
determining coordinates of the pixels in the first digital image relative to the substantially optically transparent container carrying the inoculated culture media;
removing the substantially optically transparent container carrying the inoculated culture media from the digital imaging apparatus and placing the inoculated culture media in the incubator for further incubation;
after further incubation, placing the substantially optically transparent container carrying the inoculated culture media in the digital imaging apparatus;
obtaining a second digital image of the inoculated culture media at a second time (tx), the second digital image having a plurality of pixels;
aligning the first digital image with the second digital image, such that coordinates of the plurality of pixels in the second digital image correspond to the determined coordinates of each corresponding pixel in the plurality of pixels in the first digital image;
comparing the pixels of the second digital image with corresponding pixels of the first digital image;
identifying pixels that changed between the first digital image and the second digital image, wherein the pixels that have not changed between the first digital image and the second digital image are indicative of background;
determining which of the identified pixels in the second digital image have a predetermined level of threshold contrast with pixels indicative of background;
1 identifying one or more objects in the second digital image, each object comprising pixels that possess the predetermined level of threshold contrast with the pixels indicative of background and that are not separated from each other by background pixels;
correlating the identified objects with a biomass;
determining if the biological sample is identified as a pure sample, and, if so, further determining if the biomass is above a first threshold, the first threshold being a predetermined area of the culture media covered by the identified object, and, if an area of the identified object is above the first threshold, picking at least a portion of the biomass for further analysis; and
if the biological sample is not a pure sample, further incubating the inoculated culture media in the substantially optically transparent container.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein, if no objects are identified after a predetermined period of time, flagging the substantially optically transparent container with the inoculated culture media as a no growth plate.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein, after the step of further incubating, a third digital image comprising pixels is obtained, the method further comprising:
identifying additional pixels that changed from the second digital image to the third digital image;
determining which of the identified pixels and the additional identified pixels in the third digital image have a predetermined level of threshold contrast with the pixels indicative of background; identifying one or more objects in the third digital image, each object comprising pixels that possess said predetermined level of threshold contrast with the pixels indicative of background and that are not separated from each other by background pixels;
correlating the identified objects with a biomass; and
determining if the biomass if above a second threshold, wherein the second threshold is one of: i) a threshold area covered by the biomass if the object is from a pure sample; or ii) a diameter of the biomass if the object is from a sample that is not pure; and
if the biomass is above the second threshold, picking at least a portion of the biomass for analysis, wherein the second threshold biomass is greater than the first threshold.
4. The method of claim 1 further comprising aligning the second digital image with the first digital image, wherein said alignment is based on a location of a fiducial mark on the substantially optically transparent container. 2
5. The method of claim 3 further comprising aligning the third digital image with the second digital image, wherein said alignment is based on a location of a fiducial mark on the
substantially optically transparent container.
6. The method of claims 4 and 5 wherein the fiducial mark is selected from the group consisting of an off-center optically detectable mark dot on a bottom of the substantially optically transparent container, an end of an optically detectable label disposed on a side of the substantially optically transparent container and a center of an optically detectable label on the substantially optically transparent container.
7. The method of claim 1 further comprising obtaining a plurality of first digital images at the first time according to a predetermined series of illumination conditions, wherein each of the first digital images is obtained under a different illumination condition, each illumination condition comprising a specified orientation of the substantially optically transparent container carrying the inoculated culture media relative to an illumination source, and a specified background color on which the substantially optically transparent container is placed in the digital imaging apparatus.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein the digital imaging apparatus comprises:
an illumination source directed downward toward a top of the substantially optically transparent container carrying the inoculated culture media;
an illumination source directed upward toward a bottom of the substantially optically transparent container carrying the inoculated culture media; and
an illumination source directed toward a side of the substantially optically transparent container carrying the inoculated culture media.
9. The method of claim 8 wherein for the specified orientation of the substantially optically transparent container relative to the top illumination source and the specified orientation of the substantially optically transparent container relative to the side illumination source, the specified background color is black; and for the specified orientation of the substantially optically transparent container relative to the bottom illumination source, the specified background color is white.
10. The method of claim 8 wherein the illumination sources comprise an illumination source emitting red wavelengths; an illumination source emitting green wavelengths; and an
illumination source emitting blue wavelengths.
11. The method of claim 1 wherein the objects are colonies of microorganisms. 3
