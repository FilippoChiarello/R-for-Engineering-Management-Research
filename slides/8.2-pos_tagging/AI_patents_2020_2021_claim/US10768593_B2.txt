<abstract>
The system generally includes a crosspoint switch in a local data collection system having multiple inputs and multiple outputs including a first input connected to a first sensor and a second input connected to a second sensor. The multiple outputs include a first output and a second output configured to be switchable between a condition in which the first output is configured to switch between delivery of a first sensor signal and a second sensor signal and a condition in which there is simultaneous delivery of the first sensor signal and the second sensor signal. Each of multiple inputs is configured to be individually assigned to any of the multiple outputs. The local data collection system includes multiple data acquisition units each having an onboard card set configured to store calibration information and maintenance history. The local data collection system is configured to manage data collection bands.
