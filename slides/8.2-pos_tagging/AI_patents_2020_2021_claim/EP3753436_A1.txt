APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DETECTING INTERNAL DEFECT IN PROTECTIVE HEADGEAR
</title>

<abstract>
Apparatus (100) and method for detecting internal defects of a protective headgear (101) are provided. The apparatus includes a protective headgear (101), an actuator element (107) integrated within the protective headgear (101), a sensor element (109A, 109B, 109C, 109D) integrated within the protective headgear (101), and a processor element (111) electronically coupled to the actuator element (107) and the sensor element (109A, 109B, 109C, 1009D). The processor element (111) is configured to cause the actuator element (107) to generate a first ultrasonic wave, wherein the first ultrasonic wave is propagated in the protective headgear (101), and receive a first output from the sensor element (109A, 109B, 109C, 109D) in response to the first ultrasonic wave.

<claims>
1. An apparatus, comprising: a protective headgear; an actuator element integrated within the protective headgear; a sensor element integrated within the protective headgear; and a processor element electronically coupled to the actuator element and the sensor element, wherein the processor element is configured to: cause the actuator element to generate a first ultrasonic wave, wherein the first ultrasonic wave is propagated in the protective headgear; and receive a first output from the sensor element in response to the first ultrasonic wave.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processor element is further configured to: cause the actuator element to generate a second ultrasonic wave, wherein the second ultrasonic wave is propagated in the protective headgear; receive a second output from the sensor element in response to the second ultrasonic wave; and determine whether the protective headgear comprises an internal defect based on the first output and the second output.
3. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein, when determining whether the protective headgear comprises the internal defect, the processor element is further configured to: calculate an output difference between the second output and the first output; and determine whether the output difference satisfies a pre-determined threshold.
4. The apparatus of claim 3, further comprising a speaker element disposed on an outer surface of the protective headgear and electronically coupled to the processor element, wherein the processor element is further configured to: determine that the output difference does not satisfy the pre-determined threshold; and in response to determining that the output difference does not satisfy the pre-determined threshold, cause the speaker element to output an audio alert.
5. The apparatus of claim 3, further comprising a light-emitting diode (LED) element disposed on an outer surface the protective headgear and electronically coupled to the processor element, wherein the processor element is further configured to: determine that the output difference does not satisfy the pre-determined threshold; and in response to determining that the output difference does not satisfy the pre-determined threshold, cause the LED element to generate a visual alert.
6.
