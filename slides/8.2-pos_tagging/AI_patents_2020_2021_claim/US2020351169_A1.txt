INFERRING RADIO TYPE FROM CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS
</title>

<abstract>
Described embodiments provide systems and methods for inferring a network type and network conditions. The system includes a packet capturing engine configured to capture a plurality of network packets from a plurality of TCP network connections. The system includes a packet analyzer configured to analyze the plurality of network packets to generate a plurality of metrics. The system includes a network classifier configured to infer network types of the plurality of TCP connections based on the plurality of metrics and at least one classification model. The system also includes a conditions ranking engine configured to estimate a level of network congestion for each TCP connection based on the plurality of metrics and the network types.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method comprising: using, by a device, inter-arrival intervals of network packets to distinguish between a plurality of types of networks; determining, by the device, inter-arrival intervals of one or more packets of a transport layer connection; and identifying, by the device, a type of network for the transport layer connection based at least on at least the inter-arrival intervals of one or more packets.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising using, by the device, a percentage of inter-arrival intervals of the network packets within one or more thresholds to distinguish between the plurality of types of networks.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising using, by the device, a probability of a network packet having an inter-arrival interval within the one or more thresholds to distinguish between the plurality of types of networks.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of types of networks comprises one of a mobile network or a fixed network.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of types of networks comprise one of a 2G, 3G, 4G or 5G network.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising using, by the device, a classification model to distinguish between different types of networks based at least on using the inter-arrival intervals of one or more network packets as input to the classification model.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving the one or more packets of the transport layer connection and determining the inter-arrival intervals from receipt of the one or more packets.
8. A system comprising: one or more processors, coupled to memory and configured to: use inter-arrival intervals of network packets to distinguish between a plurality of types of networks; determine inter-arrival intervals of one or more packets of a transport layer connection; and identify a type of network for the transport layer connection based at least on at least the inter-arrival intervals of one or more packets.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to use a percentage of inter-arrival intervals of the network packets within one or more thresholds to distinguish between the plurality of types of networks.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to use a probability of a network packet having an inter-arrival interval within the one or more thresholds to distinguish between the plurality of types of networks.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the plurality of types of networks comprise one of a 2G, 3G, 4G or 5G network.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to establish a classification model to distinguish between different types of networks based on using at least on the inter-arrival intervals of one or more network packets as input to the classification model.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the one or more processors are configured to receive the one or more packets of the transport layer connection and determine the inter-arrival intervals from receipt of the one or more packets.
14. A system comprising: one or more processors, coupled to memory and configured to: use round trip times of network packets to distinguish between a plurality of types of networks; determine round trip times of one or more packets of a transport layer connection; and identify a type of network for the transport layer connection based at least on at least the round trip times of one or more packets.
15. The system of claim 15, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to use an average of round trip times of the network packets within one or more thresholds to distinguish between the plurality of types of networks.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to use one of a maximum round trip or a minimum round trip time to distinguish between the plurality of types of networks.
17. The system of claim 15, wherein the plurality of types of networks comprises one of a mobile network or a fixed network.
18. The system of claim 15, wherein the plurality of types of networks comprises one of a 2G, 3G, 4G or 5G network.
19. The system of claim 15, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to establish a classification model to distinguish between different types of networks based on using at least on the round trip times of one or more network packets as input to the classification model.
