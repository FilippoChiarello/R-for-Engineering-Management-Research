<title>
Driver performance measurement and monitoring with path analysis
</title>

<abstract>
A method for performing driver performance comparisons is enabled, e.g., via in-vehicle capture of performance data from multiple vehicles or drivers. The performance comparisons are enabled via a geohash-based path analysis.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: for each of a set of vehicles, receiving one or more performance metrics; for each of the one or more routes, receiving geospatial data, the geospatial data comprising a hierarchical spatial data structure that subdivides space into buckets of grid shape; for each of the set of vehicles, associating the received performance metrics with buckets of the geospatial data; responsive to receipt of a query, and with respect to a particular route associated with the geospatial data, performing a comparative analysis of the performance metrics associated with at least first and second vehicles; and based at least in part on a result of the comparative analysis, providing control signaling for an in-vehicle system.
2. The method as described in claim 1 wherein a bucket in hierarchical spatial data structure is associated with a geohash.
3. The method as described in claim 2 wherein the grid shape is defined by one of: an MGRS grid, and any grid defined by an encoding of arbitrary location data into a string mapping.
4. The method as described in claim 1 wherein performing the comparative analysis comprises: for the particular route, identifying the buckets through which the particular route passes, and identifying a subset of the identified buckets that are common to routes over which the first and second vehicles both passed; retrieving the performance metrics for each of the subset of the identified buckets; and performing a given function over the retrieved performance metrics for at least one of the identified buckets in the subset.
5. The method as described in claim 4 further including providing an output of the comparative analysis.
6. The method as described in claim 5 wherein the output is one of: a visualization, a notification, a machine learning training model, and an alert.
7. The method as described in claim 1 wherein the query is received programmatically.
8. The method as described in claim 1 wherein the geospatial data is received via an application programming interface (API).
9. The method as described in claim 1 wherein the performance metrics are one of: vehicle speed, engine load, engine speed, fuel rate, transmission gear value, mass air flow, cruise control use, braking data, and acceleration data.
10. The method as described in claim 9 wherein one or more of the performance metrics are associated with a particular time-of-day.
11. The method as described in claim 1 wherein the comparative analysis is carried out periodically, or in response to occurrence of an event.
12. Apparatus, comprising: a hardware processor, and a computer memory holding computer program code executed by the hardware processor, computer program code configured to: for each of a set of vehicles, receive one or more performance metrics; for each of the one or more routes, receive geospatial data, the geospatial data comprising a hierarchical spatial data structure that subdivides space into buckets of grid shape; for each of the set of vehicles, associate the collected performance metrics with buckets of the geospatial data; responsive to receipt of a query, and with respect to a particular route associated with the geospatial data, perform a comparative analysis of the performance metrics associated with at least first and second vehicles; and based at least in part on a result of the comparative analysis, provide control signaling for an in-vehicle system.
13. The apparatus as described in claim 12 wherein a bucket in hierarchical spatial data structure is associated with a geohash.
14. The apparatus as described in claim 13 wherein the grid shape is defined by one of: an MGRS grid, and any grid defined by an encoding of arbitrary location data into a string mapping.
15. The apparatus as described in claim 12 wherein the computer code to perform the comparative analysis comprises program code further configured to: for the particular route, identify the buckets through which the particular route passes, and identify a subset of the identified buckets that are common to routes over which the first and second vehicles both passed; retrieve the performance metrics for each of the subset of the identified buckets; and perform a given function over the retrieved performance metrics for at least one of the identified buckets in the subset.
16. The apparatus as described in claim 15 wherein the program code is further configured to provide an additional output of the comparative analysis, the additional output being one of: a visualization, a notification, a machine learning training model, and an alert.
17. A computing system, comprising: a network-accessible computing platform, the computing platform configured to: for each of a set of vehicles, receive activity data; for each of the one or more routes, receive geospatial data, the geospatial data comprising a hierarchical spatial data structure that subdivides space into buckets of grid shape; for each of the set of vehicles, associate the received activity data with buckets of the geospatial data; responsive to receipt of a query, and with respect a particular route associated with the geospatial data, perform a comparative analysis of the activity data collected at least first and second vehicles; and based at least in part on a result of the comparative analysis, provide control signaling for an in-vehicle system.
18. The computing system as described in claim 17 wherein the activity data includes performance metrics obtained from one of: driving of actual vehicles, and driving of simulated vehicles.
19. The method as described in claim 1 wherein the performance metrics for the set of vehicles are obtained from a third party data source.
20. The method as described in claim 1 wherein the performance metrics received are metrics captured as a particular vehicle is driven over or otherwise idled with respect to a route within at least one geospatial bucket.
