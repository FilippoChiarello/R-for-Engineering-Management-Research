Method and system for measuring viewership of people for displayed object
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention is a method and system for measuring viewership of people for a displayed object. The displayed object can be specific in-store marketing elements, such as static signage, POP displays, and other forms of digital media, including retail TV networks and kiosks. In the present invention, the viewership comprises impression level, impression count of the viewers, such as how many people actually viewed said displayed object, average length of impression, distribution of impressions by time of day, and rating of media effectiveness based on audience response. The viewership of people is performed automatically based on the 3-dimensional face pose estimation of the people, using a plurality of means for capturing images and a plurality of computer vision technologies on the captured visual information. The present invention distinguishes viewers from passers-by among the plurality of persons in the vicinity of the displayed object, by counting the number of viewers who actually viewed the displayed object vs. passers-by who may appear in the vicinity of the displayed object but do not actually view the displayed object, using the 3-dimensional face pose estimation and a novel usage of a plurality of computer vision technologies.
