<title>
Cognitive digital video filtering based on user preferences
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for digital video content filtering is provided and includes receiving a request to filter instances of recorded digital video content, based on user preferences from a user profile. The instances are segmented based on a cognitive analysis using content tags in the instances. The computer accesses a relationship map and tags from the user profile. The relationship map describes how the segments from the instances of recorded digital video content are related to each other. The computer performs a cognitive analysis of the user profile data utilizing the accessed relationship map and tags. A relevance score is assigned to the instances of recorded digital video content, which indicates a strength of the relationship between the identified instances and the user viewing preferences and/or keywords. Relevant segments are identified based on the relevance score exceeding a predetermined threshold value. The relevant segments are stored on the computer.

<claims>
1. A method for digital video content filtering, comprising: receiving a request to filter instances of recorded digital video content, stored on a computer readable medium, based on user preferences included in a user profile; extracting segments from the instances of recorded digital video content based on content tags in the instances, the content tags having been generated by a computer using cognitive analysis, each segment having an intro and an outro, and storing the segments on the computer readable medium; accessing, by the computer, a relationship map and tags from the user profile, wherein the relationship map describes how the segments from the instances of recorded digital video content are related to each other, and the tags are used to describe digital video content; performing, by the computer, a cognitive analysis of the user profile utilizing the accessed relationship map and tags; assigning a relevance score to the extracted segments from the instances of recorded digital video content, wherein the relevance score indicates a strength of a relationship between the extracted segments and the user viewing preferences or keywords; identifying relevant segments based on the relevance score exceeding a predetermined threshold value; and storing on the computer the identified relevant segments.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: ranking the extracted segments in order of descending relevance.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising assigning a high degree of relevance between the relevant segments based on the relevant segments having relevance scores within a same range; and linking one or more relevant segments together based on a degree of relevance to form a segment having a similar characteristic, including content, sentiment, subject, and type.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: performing cognitive analysis to detect context clues in the one or more segments, the context clues being information that describe the one or more segments.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the user profile data includes a stored user viewing history, a stored list of computer-generated content tags, a stored list of user entered tags, and a plurality of user preferences, and wherein the cognitive analysis continuously updates the user profile based on a parsing of the user history of viewed digital video content and based on the user viewing one or more relevant segments extracted from the instances of recorded digital video content.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the performing, by the computer, the cognitive analysis of the user profile data comprises deciding a type and subject matter of interest to the user.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the cognitive analysis is performed on previously viewed digital video content, relevant segments extracted from the instances of recorded digital video content, and stored but unviewed recorded digital video content.
