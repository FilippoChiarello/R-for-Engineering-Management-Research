INJECTION LOCATION AND/OR DOSAGE DETERMINATION DEVICE AND SYSTEM FOR A LIQUID DRUG ADMINISTRATION DEVICE OR SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a position determination device (100) (and system) for determining and registering an injection location of a liquid drug administered on a body part of a user, wherein the position determination device (100) (and system) comprises a position determination element (110) configured to provide a position signal representing a current location of the position determination device (100), and one or more processing units (150) configured to derive data representing an actual injection location based on the user in response to a current location being determined by the position determination unit (110). The position determination device may be further configured for determining a dosage activity performed by a liquid drug administration device (200) based on obtaining at least one vibration signal from a vibration determination element (110).

1. 1-29. (canceled)
30. A dosage determination device for determining a dosage activity performed by a liquid drug administration device, the dosage determination device being configured to obtain at least one vibration signal from a vibration determination element, the vibration determination element being configured to obtain the at least one vibration signal in response to registering vibration of the liquid drug administration device, wherein the dosage determination device further comprises one or more processing units configured to provide a first processed signal by deriving a derivative or a second order derivative on the basis of at least a part of the at least one vibration signal, determine a number of local extrema in the first processed signal resulting in a number of determined local extrema, and processing the number of determined local extrema by matching against predetermined patterns of groups of local extrema, each group of predetermined local extrema representing a particular associated dosage activity, thereby determining whether at least one dosage activity is indicated to be present in the at least one vibration signal, and wherein the at least one vibration signal comprises a plurality of gyrometer vibration signals and a plurality of accelerometer vibration signals and wherein the one or more processing units are configured to derive a first combined signal on the basis of the plurality of gyrometer vibration signals, and derive a second combined signal on the basis of the plurality of accelerometer vibration signals.
31. The dosage determination device according to claim 30, wherein the vibration determination element comprises at least one gyrometer and/or at least one accelerometer and wherein the at least one vibration signal obtained by the dosage determination device comprises at least one gyrometer vibration signal and/or at least one accelerometer vibration signal.
32. The dosage determination device according to claim 31, wherein the vibration determination element is a six degree of freedom inertial measurement unit providing six signals respectively indicative of translational movement along three predetermined perpendicular axes and of rotational movement about the three predetermined perpendicular axes, whereby the least one vibration signal comprises three orthogonal gyrometer vibration signals and three orthogonal accelerometer vibration signals.
33. The dosage determination device according to claim, wherein the at least one vibration signal comprises a plurality of vibration signals and wherein the one or more processing units are further configured to derive a combined signal on the basis of at least some, e.g. all, of the plurality of vibration signals, and provide the first processed signal by deriving a derivative or a second order derivative of the combined signal instead of on the basis of at least a part of the at least one vibration signal.
34. The dosage determination device according to claim 33, wherein the one or more processing units are configured to derive the combined signal by subtracting an amplitude of one of the plurality of vibration signals by an amplitude of at least one other of the plurality of vibration signals.
35. (canceled)
36. The dosage determination device according to claim 30, wherein the one or more processing units are configured to derive a third combined signal on the basis of the first combined signal and the second combined signal.
37. The dosage determination device according to claim 36, wherein the one or more processing units are configured to derive the third combined signal by subtracting the second combined signal from the first combined signal.
38. The dosage determination device according to claim 30, wherein the dosage determination device is configured to obtain at least one sound signal from at least one sound sensor configured to register one or more distinct sounds caused by the drug administration device when operated by a user to perform the dosage activity, and provide the first processed signal on the basis of at least a part of the at least one sound signal instead or in addition to at least a part of the at least one vibration signal.
39. The dosage determination device according to claim 38, wherein the dosage determination device is configured to determine whether at least one dosage activity is indicated to be present in the at least one vibration signal, determine whether at least one dosage activity is indicated to be present in the least one sound signal, and deciding that at least one dosage activity is determined only if the at least one dosage activity is determined to be present in both the at least one vibration signal and the least one sound signal.
