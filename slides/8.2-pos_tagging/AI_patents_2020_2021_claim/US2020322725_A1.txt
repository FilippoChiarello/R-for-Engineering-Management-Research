DYNAMIC DEVICE SPEAKER TUNING FOR ECHO CONTROL
</title>

<abstract>
Dynamic device speaker tuning for echo control includes detecting audio rendering from a speaker on a device; based at least on detecting the audio rendering, capturing, with a microphone on the device, an echo of the rendered audio; performing a Fourier Transform on the echo and the rendered audio; determining a real-time transfer function for at least one signature band; determining a difference between the real-time transfer function and a reference transfer function; and tuning the speaker for audio rendering, based at least on the difference between the real-time transfer function and the reference transfer function, by adjusting an audio amplifier equalization. For some examples, the signature band represents a wall echo or an alternative mounting option. For some examples, the echo is collected during intervals while the audio rendering is ongoing.

<claims>
1. A system for dynamic device speaker tuning for echo control, the system comprising: a speaker located on a device; a processor; and a computer-readable medium storing instructions that are operative when executed by the processor to: determine, based at least on an echo of rendered audio, a real-time transfer function, wherein the real-time transfer function includes at least one signature band; determine a difference between the real-time transfer function and a reference transfer function; tune a speaker for audio rendering, based at least on the difference between the real-time transfer function and the reference transfer function, by adjusting an audio amplifier equalization.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions are further operative to: determine whether a portion, above a threshold, of captured audio comprises the echo of the rendered audio.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions are further operative to: capture the echo of the rendered audio.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions are further operative to: align the echo with a copy of the rendered audio.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the signature band comprises a signature band for a mount echo.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions are further operative to: determine whether the difference between the real-time transfer function and the reference transfer function, within a band, exceeds a threshold; and wherein tuning the speaker for audio rendering comprises: tuning the speaker for audio rendering within the band, based at least on the difference between the real-time transfer function and the reference transfer function exceeding the threshold.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein determining the real-time transfer function comprises dividing a magnitude of the FT of the echo by a magnitude of the FT of the rendered audio.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions are further operative to: render audio data as an audio stream over the speaker, using the audio amplifier, to generate the rendered audio.
9. A method of dynamic device speaker tuning for echo control, the method comprising: determining, based at least on an echo of rendered audio, a real-time transfer function, wherein the real-time transfer function includes at least one signature band; determining a difference between the real-time transfer function and a reference transfer function; tuning a speaker for audio rendering, based at least on the difference between the real-time transfer function and the reference transfer function, by adjusting an audio amplifier equalization.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising: determining whether a portion, above a threshold, of captured audio comprises the echo of the rendered audio.
11. The method of claim 9, further comprising: capturing the echo of the rendered audio.
12. The method of claim 9, further comprising: aligning the echo with a copy of the rendered audio.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein the signature band comprises a signature band for a mount echo.
14. The method of claim 9, further comprising: determining whether the difference between the real-time transfer function and the reference transfer function, within a band, exceeds a threshold; and wherein tuning the speaker for audio rendering comprises: tuning the speaker for audio rendering within the band, based at least on the difference between the real-time transfer function and the reference transfer function exceeding the threshold.
15. The method of claim 9, wherein determining the real-time transfer function comprises dividing a magnitude of the FT of the echo by a magnitude of the FT of the rendered audio.
16. One or more computer storage devices having computer-executable instructions stored thereon for dynamic device speaker tuning for echo control, which, on execution by a computer, cause the computer to perform operations comprising: determining, based at least on an echo of rendered audio, a real-time transfer function, wherein the real-time transfer function includes at least one signature band; determining a difference between the real-time transfer function and a reference transfer function; tuning a speaker for audio rendering, based at least on the difference between the real-time transfer function and the reference transfer function, by adjusting an audio amplifier equalization.
17. The one or more computer storage devices of claim 16, wherein the operations further comprise: determining whether a portion, above a threshold, of captured audio comprises the echo of the rendered audio.
18. The one or more computer storage devices of claim 16, wherein the operations further comprise: capturing the echo of the rendered audio.
19. The one or more computer storage devices of claim 16, wherein the signature band comprises a signature band for a mount echo.
20. The one or more computer storage devices of claim 16, wherein the operations further comprise: determining whether the difference between the real-time transfer function and the reference transfer function, within a band, exceeds a threshold; and wherein tuning the speaker for audio rendering comprises: tuning the speaker for audio rendering within the band, based at least on the difference between the real-time transfer function and the reference transfer function exceeding the threshold.
