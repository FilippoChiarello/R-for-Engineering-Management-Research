<title>
Data Processing System with Machine Learning Engine to Provide Output Generation Functions
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, computer-readable media, systems, and/or apparatuses for providing offer and insight generation functions are provided. For instance, user input may be received requesting generation of an offer. In response to receiving the request, an application may be transmitted to a device, such as a mobile device of a user. In some examples, the application may be executed by the device and may facilitate establishing a communication session with a third party system, identifying and extracting data from the third party system, and transmitting the extracted data to an entity for evaluation. In some examples, evaluation by the entity may include generating one or more insights, outputs and the like. In some arrangements, the evaluation may be performed using machine learning and, in some examples, may be performed in real-time or near real-time.

<claims>
1. A computing platform, comprising: a processing unit comprising a processor; and a memory unit storing computer-executable instructions, which when executed by the processing unit, cause the computing platform to: receive a request to generate an offer; transmit an application to a mobile device of a user; execute the application on the mobile device of the user to identify and extract data from a third party system; receive, from the third party system and via the mobile device of the user, the data; analyze the data to evaluate the user; and generate an output based on the analyzed data.
2. The computing platform of claim 1, wherein the data is analyzed using machine learning.
3. The computing platform of claim 1, wherein the data received from the third party system is location data corresponding to locations of the mobile device at a plurality of days and times.
4. The computing platform of claim 3, wherein the data is captured by a global positioning system of the mobile device and stored by the third party system.
5. The computing platform of claim 4, wherein the data is captured and stored prior to receiving the request to generate the offer.
6. The computing platform of claim 3, wherein the data includes a plurality of location entries corresponding to each location of the mobile device at a particular day and time.
7. The computing platform of claim 6, wherein each location entry includes longitude and latitude coordinates of the location and a time and data stamp.
8. The computing platform of claim 1, further including instructions that, when executed, cause the computing platform to generate one or more insights related to the user including at least one of: frequently visited locations, time spent driving within predefined distance of a home location, and distances travelled.
9. A computing device, comprising: a processing unit comprising a processor; and a memory unit storing computer-executable instructions, which when executed by the processing unit, cause the computing device to: generate, based on user input from a user, a request for an offer; transmit the generated request to a computing platform; responsive to transmitting the request, receiving, from the computing platform, an application for execution on the computing device; executing the application on the computing device to: initiate a communication session with a third party computing system; extract user data associated with the user and stored on the third party computing system; receive, from the third party computing system, the extracted user data; transmit the received, extracted user data to the computing platform; and receive, from the computing platform, a generated output based on the extracted user data.
10. The computing device of claim 9, wherein the extracted user data is location data corresponding to locations of the computing device at a plurality of days and times.
11. The computing device of claim 10, wherein the extracted user data is captured by a global positioning system of the computing device and stored by the third party computing system.
12. The computing device of claim 11, wherein the extracted user data is captured and stored prior to generating the request to generate the offer.
13. The computing device of claim 11, wherein the extracted user data includes a plurality of location entries corresponding to each location of the computing device at a particular day and time.
14. The computing device of claim 13, wherein each location entry includes longitude and latitude coordinates of the location and a time and data stamp.
15. One or more non-transitory computer-readable media storing computer-executable instructions that, when executed by a computing device, cause the computing device to: generate, based on user input from a user, a request for an offer; transmit the generated request to a computing platform; responsive to transmitting the request, receiving, from the computing platform, an application for execution on the computing device; executing the application on the computing device, including: initiate a communication session with a third party computing system; extract user data associated with the user and stored on the third party computing system; receive, from the third party computing system, the extracted user data; transmit the received, extracted user data to the computing platform; and receive, from the computing platform, a generated output based on the extracted user data.
16. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 15, wherein the extracted user data is location data corresponding to locations of the computing device at a plurality of days and times.
17. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 16, wherein the extracted user data is captured by a global positioning system of the computing device and stored by the third party computing system.
18. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 17, wherein the extracted user data is captured and stored prior to generating the request to generate the offer.
19. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 17, wherein the extracted user data includes a plurality of location entries corresponding to each location of the computing device at a particular day and time.
20. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 19, wherein each location entry includes longitude and latitude coordinates of the location and a time and data stamp.
