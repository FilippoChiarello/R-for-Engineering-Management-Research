EMBEDDED FIBER OPTIC SENSOR SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A method, apparatus, and system for monitoring a vehicle. Optical signals are sent into a fiber optic mesh covering a region of the vehicle. Response optical signals occurring in response to optical signals sent into the fiber optic mesh are detected. Sensor data is generated from the response optical signals detected. A determination is made as to whether a group of nonconformances is present in the vehicle using the sensor data. A group of actions is performed when the group of nonconformances is present.
