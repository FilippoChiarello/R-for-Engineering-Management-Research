METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATICALLY ENRICHING COLLECTED SEEDS WITH INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM ONE OR MORE WEBSITES
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems are provided for automatically enriching collected seeds. Each website that is associated with each collected seed is processed via a web crawler that crawls a home webpage for the company associated with that collected seed to verify, based on similarity between company name and website name, that a website associated with that home page belongs to that company. When verification is successful, other webpages on the website are processed to fetch information using different extractor algorithms each being designed to fetch a specific attribute for that company. Search engine(s) and third-party APIs can also be used to collect additional company information that can be added to each collected seed. Each collected seed is then enriched by adding all of the additional company information to the original seed data.
