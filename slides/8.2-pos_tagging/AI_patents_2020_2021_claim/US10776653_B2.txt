</title>

<abstract>
A System and a method for processing at least two M-dimensional data-measurements (DMs) of a physical-property for detecting one or more new-objects and/or a transition of one or more known-objects, in complex constant-background DMs, using at least one processor and at least one memory element, the method comprising: generating a filtered-new-DM by match-filtering a new-DM, respective to impulse response of a reference-DM; generating a filtered-reference-DM by match-filtering the reference-DM, respective to impulse response of the new-DM; generating an M-dimensional object-indicator (OI) by subtracting the filtered-reference-DM from the filtered-new-DM, or vice versa; and generating an M-dimensional data score (DS) from the M-dimensional OI, where each of the scores is a probe for existence of an object at a specific M-dimensional location.
