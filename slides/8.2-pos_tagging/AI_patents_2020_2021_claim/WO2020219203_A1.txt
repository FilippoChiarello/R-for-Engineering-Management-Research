INSIGHTS INTO PERFORMANCE OF A BOT SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates generally to techniques for analyzing and improving a bot system, and more particularly to an analytic system integrated with a bot system for monitoring, analyzing, visualizing, diagnosing, and improving the performance of the bot system. For example, an analytic system is integrated with a bot system for monitoring, analyzing, visualizing, and improving the performance of the bot system. The analytic system monitors events occurred in conversations between end users and the bot system, aggregates and analyzes the collected events, and provides information regarding the conversations graphically on a graphic user interface as insights reports at different generalization levels. The insights reports offer developer-oriented analytics to pinpoint issues with skills so a user can address them before they cause problems. The insights let a user track conversation trends over time, identify execution paths, determine the accuracy of their intent resolutions, and access entire conversation transcripts.
