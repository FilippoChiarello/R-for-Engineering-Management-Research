BIOMETRIC FREQUENCY
</title>

<abstract>
A plurality of frequency orthogonal signals are transmitted into a person. At least one of the plurality of frequency orthogonal signals is received at a receiving antenna or conductor. The received signal is measured. Characteristics of the received signal are used to establish a result related to that person.
