Identifying user content
</title>

<abstract>
This disclosure describes, in part, techniques for identifying user-specific content items and/or time-based content items, as well as techniques for providing the content items to the user. For instance, a remote system may receive first audio data from an electronic device, where the first audio data represents a request to identify content related to a topic. The remote system can then store the topic in a database and use the topic to identify the content. Later, the remote system can then receive second audio data from the electronic device, where the second audio data represents a request for the content. The remote system can then send third audio data to the electronic device that represents at least a portion of the content.
