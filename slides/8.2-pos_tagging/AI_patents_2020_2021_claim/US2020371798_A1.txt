Method and Apparatus for Vector Based Matrix Multiplication
</title>

<abstract>
A method is provided that includes performing, by a processor in response to a vector matrix multiply instruction, multiplying an m×n matrix (A matrix) and a n×p matrix (B matrix) to generate elements of an m×p matrix (R matrix), and storing the elements of the R matrix in a storage location specified by the vector matrix multiply instruction.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: performing, by a processor in response to a vector matrix multiply instruction, multiplying an m×n matrix (A matrix) and a n×p matrix (B matrix) to generate elements of an m×p matrix (R matrix); and storing the elements of the R matrix in a storage location specified by the vector matrix multiply instruction.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein m=4, n=8, and p=4.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein multiplying further comprises generating the elements of the R matrix using vector multiplication units comprised in a vector data path of the processor and configured to perform vector multiply operations, wherein each vector multiplication unit comprises a slice multiply component for each slice of the vector data path, and wherein each slice multiply component generates a respective element of the R matrix.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising: mapping elements of rows of the A matrix and elements of columns of the B matrix to each slice multiplication component based on the respective element of the R matrix to be generated by the slice multiplication component.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the elements of the rows the A matrix and the elements of columns of the B matrix are provided by a streaming engine, and wherein the mapping is performed by a permute network coupled between the streaming engine and the vector multiplication components.
6. A processor comprising: an instruction decoder configured to decode a vector matrix multiply instruction; and vector matrix multiplication logic configured to multiply, responsive to the vector matrix multiply instruction, an m×n matrix (A matrix) and a n×p matrix (B matrix) to generate elements of an m×p matrix (R matrix).
7. The processor of claim 6, wherein m=4, n=8, and p=4.
8. The processor of claim 6, wherein the vector matrix multiplication logic comprises vector multiplication units comprised in a vector data path of the processor and configured to perform vector multiply operations, wherein each vector multiplication unit comprises a slice multiply component for each slice of the vector data path, and wherein each slice multiply component is configured to generate a respective element of the R matrix.
9. The processor of claim 8, wherein elements of rows of the A matrix and elements of columns of the B matrix are mapped to each slice multiplication component based on the respective element of the R matrix to be generated by the slice multiplication component.
10. The processor of claim 9, wherein the elements of the rows the A matrix and the elements of columns of the B matrix are provided by a streaming engine, and wherein the elements of the rows of the A matrix and the elements of the columns of the B matrix are mapped by a permute network coupled between the streaming engine and the vector multiplication units.
11. The processor of claim 6, wherein the processor is a digital signal processor (DSP).
