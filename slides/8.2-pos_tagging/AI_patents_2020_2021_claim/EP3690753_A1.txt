DETERMINATION OF THE DRIVING CONTEXT OF A VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention is related to a method, a computer program, and an apparatus for determining a driving context of a vehicle. In a first step, sensor data of one or more sensors of the vehicle are received (10). Then an occupancy grid is determined (11) based on the sensor data. Finally, the occupancy grid is parsed (12) with a convolutional neural network for determining the driving context.
