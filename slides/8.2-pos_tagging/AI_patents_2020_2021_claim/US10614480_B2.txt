Method and apparatus for return on investment impact reporting
</title>

<abstract>
The method, apparatus and computer program product described herein is configured to train and deploy a predictive model that is configured to generate a predicted ROI value for a provider with respect to a current promotion or a future promotion. An example embodiment may comprise receiving input indicative of one or more attributes of a provider or a promotion. The example embodiment may further comprise generating at least one of a predicted return on investment (ROI) value or a predicted ROI component value based at least in part on the one or more attributes of the provider or the promotion and a ROI prediction model. The method may further still comprise generating a merchant impact report including the at least one of the predicted ROI value or the predicted ROI component value for the promotion.
