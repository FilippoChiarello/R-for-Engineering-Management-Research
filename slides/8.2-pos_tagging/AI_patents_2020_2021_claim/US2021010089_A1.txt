TUMOR MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE STRATIFICATION
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to the field of tumor disease stratification, in particular melanoma disease stratification. In particular it relates to the methods for tumor analysis, such as for determining tumor cell heterogeneity during treatment. These methods are helpful in selecting or optimizing tumor therapy, or in predicting responses to tumor therapy. The invention further relates to methods for screening for cytotoxic or cytostatic compounds targeting one or more of the heterogeneous tumor cell populations occurring such as during therapy, such as during the minimal residual disease phase.
