</title>

<abstract>
A system and a method are provided for facilitating a transaction. The method may include: obtaining information that relates to a user's intention with respect to a desired experience; determining user benefits that apply to proposed transactions that relate to the desired experience with merchants; providing information that relates to the proposed user benefits to the user; and providing, to the user, an instrument that is configured to facilitate a performance of the proposed transactions.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for facilitating a transaction, the method being implemented by at least one processor comprising: obtaining, from a user by the at least one processor, first information that relates to a proposed experience that is based on an expressed intention of the user; using, by the at least one processor, the first information to determine at least one proposed user benefit that relates to at least one proposed transaction with a merchant; providing, to the user by the at least one processor, second information that relates to the at least one proposed user benefit; and providing, to the user by the at least one processor, an instrument that is configured to facilitate a performance of the at least one transaction.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the instrument includes at least one from among a physical card and a digital token.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the providing the instrument includes dynamically connecting the instrument to an account that is associated with the user, such that when the user uses the instrument for conducting a transaction, the at least one proposed user benefit is automatically applied.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising preloading, by the at least one processor, the instrument with the second information, such that the providing the instrument further includes providing the instrument together with the preloaded second information.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising enriching the first information comprises using historical transaction information that relates to prior transactions that have been executed by the user.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising enriching the first information comprises using historical search engine information that relates to prior Internet searches that have been executed by the user.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising enriching the first information comprises using social media information that relates to prior postings that have been executed by the user.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the providing the second information includes transmitting at least one from among a text message and an email message to a mobile device associated with the user.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the proposed experience relates to at least one from among traveling to a destination, attending an event, and purchasing consumer goods.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein when the proposed experience relates to traveling to a destination, the first information includes at least one from among a purchase of a ticket for an airline flight to the destination, a making of a reservation for a hotel room at the destination, and a purchase of a ticket to an event at the destination.
11. A computing apparatus for facilitating a transaction, the computing apparatus comprising: a processor; a memory; and a communication interface coupled to each of the processor and the memory, wherein the processor is configured to: obtain, from a user via the communication interface, first information that relates to a proposed experience that is based on an expressed intention of the user; use the first information to determine at least one proposed user benefit that relates to at least one proposed transaction with a merchant; provide, to the user via the communication interface, second information that relates to the at least one proposed user benefit; and provide, to the user via the communication interface, an instrument that is configured to facilitate a performance of the at least one transaction.
12. The computing apparatus of claim 11, wherein the instrument includes at least one from among a physical card and a digital token.
13. The computing apparatus of claim 12, wherein the processor is further configured to dynamically connect the instrument to an account that is associated with the user, such that when the user uses the instrument for conducting a transaction, the at least one proposed user benefit is automatically applied.
14. The computing apparatus of claim 13, wherein the processor is further configured to preload the instrument with the second information, such that the instrument is provided to the user together with the preloaded second information.
15. The computing apparatus of claim 11, wherein the processor is further configured to enrich the first information by using historical transaction information that relates to prior transactions that have been executed by the user.
16. The computing apparatus of claim 11, wherein the processor is further configured to enrich the first information by using historical search engine information that relates to prior Internet searches that have been executed by the user.
17. The computing apparatus of claim 11, wherein the processor is further configured to enrich the first information by using social media information that relates to prior postings that have been executed by the user.
18. The computing apparatus of claim 11, wherein the processor is further configured to provide the second information to the user by transmitting at least one from among a text message and an email message via the communication interface to a mobile device associated with the user.
19. The computing apparatus of claim 11, wherein the proposed experience relates to at least one from among traveling to a destination, attending an event, and purchasing consumer goods.
20. The computing apparatus of claim 19, wherein when the proposed experience relates to traveling to a destination, the first information includes at least one from among a purchase of a ticket for an airline flight to the destination, a making of a reservation for a hotel room at the destination, and a purchase of a ticket to an event at the destination.
