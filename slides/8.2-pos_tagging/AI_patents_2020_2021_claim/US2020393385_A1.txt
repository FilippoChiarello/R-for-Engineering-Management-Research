COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED METHODS FOR DETERMINING COMPRESSOR OPERABILITY
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method comprising: controlling input of data quantifying damage received by a compressor of a gas turbine engine into a first machine learning algorithm; receiving data quantifying a first operating parameter of the compressor as an output of the first machine learning algorithm; and determining operability of the compressor by comparing the received data quantifying the first operating parameter of the compressor with a threshold.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: controlling input of data quantifying damage received by a compressor of a gas turbine engine into a first machine learning algorithm; receiving data quantifying a first operating parameter of the compressor as an output of the first machine learning algorithm; and determining operability of the compressor by comparing the received data quantifying the first operating parameter of the compressor with a threshold.
2. A computer-implemented method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising: receiving data quantifying damage received by one or more compressor blades of the compressor; and generating the data quantifying damage received by the compressor using the received data quantifying damage received by one or more compressor blades, and a damage parameter.
3. A computer-implemented method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the step of receiving data quantifying damage received by one or more compressor blades of the compressor comprises: receiving image data of the compressor; and determining damage received by one or more compressor blades of the compressor using the received image data.
4. A computer-implemented method as claimed in claim 2, wherein generating the data quantifying damage received by the compressor comprises convoluting the received data quantifying damage received by one or more compressor blades of the compressor with the damage parameter.
5. A computer-implemented method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the damage parameter is an amount of damage to a portion of the first compressor.
6. A computer-implemented method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the damage parameter is one or more separations between portions of the first compressor.
7. A computer-implemented method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the damage parameter is a gradient of damage across at least a portion of the first compressor.
8. A computer-implemented method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the damage parameter is a number of damaged portions of the first compressor.
9. A computer-implemented method as claimed in claim 2, wherein generating the data quantifying damage received by the compressor comprises using the received data quantifying damage received by one or more compressor blades, and a plurality of damage parameters.
10. A computer-implemented method as claimed in claim 9, wherein generating the data quantifying damage received by the compressor comprises convoluting the received data quantifying damage received by one or more compressor blades of the compressor with each damage parameter of the plurality of damage parameters.
11. A computer-implemented method as claimed in claim 1, wherein generating the data quantifying damage received by the compressor comprises providing the received data quantifying damage received by one or more compressor blades of the compressor as an input to an algorithm.
12. A computer-implemented method as claimed in claim 11, wherein the algorithm comprises one or more Fourier-related transforms.
13. A computer-implemented method as claimed in claim 12, wherein the one or more Fourier-related transforms comprise a Hadamard transform.
14. A computer-implemented method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising: controlling input of data quantifying damage received by a compressor of a gas turbine engine into a second machine learning algorithm; receiving data quantifying a second operating parameter of the compressor as an output of the second machine learning algorithm; and determining operability of the compressor by comparing the received data quantifying the second operating parameter of the compressor with a threshold.
15. A computer-implemented method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the first operating parameter is stalling throttle coefficient and the second operating parameter is pressure rise characteristic.
16. A non-transitory computer readable storage medium comprising computer readable instructions that, when read by a computer, cause performance of the computer-implemented method as claimed in claim 1.
