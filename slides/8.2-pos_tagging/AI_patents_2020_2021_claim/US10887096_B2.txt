<title>
Methods and apparatus for a distributed database including anonymous entries
</title>

<abstract>
In some embodiments, an apparatus having at least a portion of a first instance of a distributed database at a first compute device is configured to be included within a group of compute devices that implement via a network operatively coupled to the group of compute devices the distributed database. The distributed database enables anonymous transfers of digital assets between compute devices via a transfer protocol such that an identity of a compute device associated with a private key corresponding to a public key logically related to a destination record is concealed among a set of compute devices including the first compute device and at least one second compute device.
