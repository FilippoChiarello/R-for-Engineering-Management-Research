COMPUTING DEVICE, MACHINE LEARNING METHOD, AND STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A computing device performs computation for controlling operations of a mobile manipulator configured to hold a plurality of target objects with a manipulator and move the target objects to predetermined positions. The computing device includes a storage and a calculator. The storage stores a trained machine learning model trained by inputting a plurality of training data sets, which are combinations of state variables and pieces of determination data associated with the state variables. The training data sets are acquired in advance. The calculator outputs a movement-target object to be moved to a predetermined position at current time by inputting the state variable to the trained machine learning model read from the storage. The state variable contains relative positions of the target objects to a specific portion of the mobile manipulator. The determination data associated with the state variable represents the movement-target object.

<claims>
1. A computing device configured to perform computation for controlling operations of a mobile manipulator configured to hold a plurality of target objects with a manipulator and move the target objects to predetermined positions, the computing device comprising: a storage configured to store a trained machine learning model trained by inputting a plurality of training data sets, which are combinations of state variables and pieces of determination data associated with the state variables, the training data sets being acquired in advance; and a calculator configured to output a movement-target object to be moved to a predetermined position at current time by inputting a state variable to the trained machine learning model read from the storage, wherein the state variable contains relative positions of the target objects to a specific portion of the mobile manipulator, and the determination data associated with the state variable represents the movement-target object.
2. The computing device according to claim 1, wherein the state variable contains a relative position of an obstacle to the specific portion of the mobile manipulator.
3. The computing device according to claim 2, wherein the relative positions of the target objects to the specific portion of the mobile manipulator and the relative position of the obstacle to the specific portion of the mobile manipulator are represented by data on a map or on a bitmap image.
4. The computing device according to claim 3, wherein an output of the movement-target object is data representing a relative position of the movement-target object to the specific portion of the mobile manipulator on the map or on the bitmap image.
5. The computing device according to claim 1, wherein the state variable contains route lengths of routes from the mobile manipulator to the target objects, the route lengths being obtained based on a route plan.
6. The computing device according to claim 5, wherein the state variable contains route lengths of routes from the target objects to predetermined positions associated with the target objects.
7. The computing device according to claim 2, wherein relative positions of the target objects and the obstacle to the specific portion of the mobile manipulator contain information on a gravity direction.
8. The computing device according to claim 1, wherein the relative positions of the target objects to the specific portion of the mobile manipulator contain information on holdable areas for the target objects.
9. A machine learning method for a machine learning model configured such that a computer performs a function of outputting a movement-target object to be moved to a predetermined position at current time in an operation of holding a plurality of target objects with a manipulator of a mobile manipulator and moving the target objects to predetermined positions, the machine learning method comprising training the machine learning model by inputting a plurality of training data sets, which are combinations of state variables and movement-target objects to be moved to predetermined positions at current time, the state variables each containing relative positions of the target objects to a specific portion of the mobile manipulator, the movement-target objects being represented by pieces of determination data and associated with the state variables.
10. A non-transitory storage medium storing instructions that are executable by one or more processors and that cause the one or more processors to perform functions comprising: training a machine learning model by inputting a plurality of training data sets acquired in advance, the training data sets being combinations of state variables and movement-target objects to be moved to predetermined positions at current time, the state variables each containing relative positions of a plurality of target objects to a specific portion of a mobile manipulator configured to hold the target objects with a manipulator and move the target objects to predetermined positions, the movement-target objects being represented by pieces of determination data and associated with the state variables; and outputting a movement-target object by inputting a state variable to the trained machine learning model.
