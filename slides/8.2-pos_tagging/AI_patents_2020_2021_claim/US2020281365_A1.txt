SPORT CHAIR WITH GAME INTEGRATION
</title>

<abstract>
A sport chair includes a seating surface operative to support a user and a processor. The processor is configured to detect the presence of a user on the seating surface, establish communication with an article of apparel on the body of the user, receive an indication of a physiological parameter of the user from a biometric sensor provided with the article of apparel, and output the physiological parameter to a display.

<claims>
1. A sport chair comprising: a seating surface operative to support a user; a processor configured to: detect the presence of a user on the seating surface; establish communication with an article of apparel on the body of the user; receive an indication of a physiological parameter of the user from a biometric sensor provided with the article of apparel; and output the physiological parameter to a display.
2. The sport chair of claim 1, wherein the physiological parameter includes a magnitude of an impact force experienced by the user prior to the user being present on the seating surface.
3. The sport chair of claim 2, wherein the physiological parameter includes an indication of a location where the impact force was experienced on the user.
4. The sport chair of claim 1, further comprising the display, and wherein the display is integral to the chair.
5. The sport chair of claim 4, wherein the display includes a portion that is transparent such that the user can see through the display.
6. The sport chair of claim 1, further comprising an inductive charging transmitter; and wherein the processor is operative to charge a battery associated with the article of apparel on the body of the user by transmitting a magnetic field via the inductive charging transmitter.
7. The sport chair of claim 1, wherein the physiological parameter includes at least one of hydration, weight, heart rate, respiration rate, or galvanic skin response.
8. The sport chair of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to control the article of apparel to alter a tension applied throughout the article of apparel.
9. The sport chair of claim 8, wherein the processor is further configured to receive a tension feedback signal from the article of apparel indicative of an amount of pressure exerted by the article of apparel against the user; and wherein the processor is operative to use the tension feedback signal to control the tension applied throughout the article of apparel.
10. The sport chair of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: determine an identity of the user; and store the sensed physiological parameter to a database in connection with the identity of the user.
11. The sport chair of claim 10, wherein the processor is further configured to: retrieve historical physiological parameters for the user from the database; and output a comparison of the sensed physiological parameter to the historical physiological parameters via the display.
12. A method comprising: detecting the presence of a user on a seating surface of a chair; establishing communication between a processor associated with the chair and an article of apparel on the body of the user; receiving, via the processor, an indication of a physiological parameter of the user from the article of apparel, the physiological parameter being sensed by a biometric sensor provided with the article of apparel; and outputting the physiological parameter to a display.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the physiological parameter includes a magnitude of an impact force experienced by the user prior to the user being present on the seating surface; and wherein outputting the physiological parameter to the display includes outputting the magnitude of the impact force to the display.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the physiological parameter includes an indication of a location where the impact force was experienced on the user; and wherein outputting the physiological parameter to the display further includes outputting the location to the display.
15. The method of claim 12, further comprising inductively charging a battery associated with the article of apparel on the body of the user by transmitting a magnetic field from an inductive charging transmitter on the chair.
16. The method of claim 12, further comprising controlling the article of apparel, via the processor, to alter a tension applied throughout the article of apparel.
17. The method of claim 16, further comprising receiving a tension feedback signal from the article of apparel, the tension feedback signal indicative of an amount of pressure exerted by the article of apparel against the user; and wherein controlling the article of apparel to alter a tension applied throughout the article of apparel is in response to the received tension feedback signal.
18. The method of claim 12, further comprising: determining an identity of the user, via the processor; and storing the sensed physiological parameter to a database in connection with the identity of the user.
19. The method of claim 18, further comprising: retrieving historical physiological parameters for the user from the database; and outputting a comparison of the sensed physiological parameter to the historical physiological parameters via the display.
20. A method comprising: detecting the presence of a user on the seating surface of a chair; establishing communication between a processor associated with the chair and an article of apparel on the body of the user; and controlling the article of apparel, via the processor, to reduce a tension applied throughout the article of apparel.
