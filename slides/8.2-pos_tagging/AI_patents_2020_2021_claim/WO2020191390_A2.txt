ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED QUALITY SCORING
</title>

<abstract>
The technology disclosed assigns quality scores to bases called by a neural network-based base caller by (i) quantizing classification scores of predicted base calls produced by the neural network-based base caller in response to processing training data during training, (ii) selecting a set of quantized classification scores, (iii) for each quantized classification score in the set, determining a base calling error rate by comparing its predicted base calls to corresponding ground truth base calls, (iv) determining a fit between the quantized classification scores and their base calling error rates, and (v) correlating the quality scores to the quantized classification scores based on the fit.
