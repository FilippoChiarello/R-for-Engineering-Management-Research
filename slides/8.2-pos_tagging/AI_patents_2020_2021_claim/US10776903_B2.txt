<title>
Systems and methods for image modification and image based content capture and extraction in neural networks
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for image modification to increase contrast between text and non-text pixels within the image. In one embodiment, an original document image is scaled to a predetermined size for processing by a convolutional neural network. The convolutional neural network identifies a probability that each pixel in the scaled is text and generates a heat map of these probabilities. The heat map is then scaled back to the size of the original document image, and the probabilities in the heat map are used to adjust the intensities of the text and non-text pixels. For positive text, intensities of text pixels are reduced and intensities of non-text pixels are increased in order to increase the contrast of the text against the background of the image. Optical character recognition may then be performed on the contrast-adjusted image.
