UNSUPERVISED ENTITY AND INTENT IDENTIFICATION FOR IMPROVED SEARCH QUERY RELEVANCE
</title>

<abstract>
Technologies are described here for, among other things, improving search query relevance by executing a query on a search engine, retrieving search-page-data generated from executing the query, the search-page-data including document-titles and universal resource locators (URLs), each document-title being a title of a document associated with a URL, determining relevant-entity-words in the query from an entity relevance score for matching search terms in the query, Domain-URLs, and Domain-Titles, determining relevant-intent-words in the query from an intent-word relevance score based on a number of times a search term appears in the query and the URLs relative to other search terms in the query and the URLs, comparing each of the determined relevant-entity-words and each of the determined relevant-intent-words with a plurality of stored past-user queries, retrieving the plurality of stored past-user search queries including the relevant-entity-words and the relevant-intent-words, and transmitting a set of query suggestions to a client device.
</abstract>

<claims>
