<title>
Product analysis platform to perform a facial recognition analysis to provide information associated with a product to a user
</title>

<abstract>
A device may determine that a user has a threshold level of interest in a type of product. The device may receive an image of a face of the user, may perform a facial recognition analysis of the image, and may determine identification information of the user based on the facial recognition analysis. The device may identify account information associated with the user based on the identification information and may identify a product in an inventory that is associated with the type of product. The device may perform a preauthorization process associated with a transaction involving the product and the user based on the account information, and may perform an action associated with the transaction based on the preauthorization process.

8. A device, comprising: one or more memories; and one or more processors, communicatively coupled to the one or more memories, configured to: obtain an indication that a user may engage in a transaction involving a type of product; determine, based on the indication, that the user has a threshold level of interest in the type of product; obtain an image of a face of the user; perform, using one or more artificial intelligence techniques, a facial recognition analysis of the image; determine an identity of the user based on the facial recognition analysis; identify a profile associated with the identity using the determined identity; obtain, from a data structure, one or more characteristics of the user based on the profile; identify, based on the one or more characteristics of the user, a product in an inventory, the product being associated with the type of product; perform a preauthorization process associated with the transaction and the user based on the one or more characteristics of the user, the preauthorization process being performed after determining the identity of the user based on the facial recognition analysis and without receiving input from the user after performing the facial recognition analysis, and wherein the preauthorization process includes: providing at least one preauthorization parameter as input to a preauthorization model, the preauthorization model having been trained, using historical data associated with preauthorizing at least one of the user or one or more other users, to use the at least one preauthorization parameter to determine whether transactions are preauthorized, and the at least one preauthorization parameter being associated with at least one of: one or more characteristics of the transaction, one or more characteristics of the product, or the one or more characteristics of the user; determine, from the preauthorization process, that the user is preauthorized to engage in the transaction; and provide information associated with the product to a device associated with the user, the information: permitting the user to engage in the transaction, and specifying that the user is preauthorized to purchase the product.
9. The device of claim 8, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to: based on obtaining the indication, request that the user provide the image, wherein the user, by providing the image, provides an authorization to receive the information associated with the product.
10. The device of claim 8, wherein the one or more characteristics of the user comprises at least one of: a location associated with the user, a physical trait of the user, a number of authorized users associated with the user, a determined tendency to engage in the transaction, a determined tendency to rent the product, or a score indicating that the user is eligible to purchase the product.
