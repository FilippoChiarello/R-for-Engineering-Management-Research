<title>
Image processing using a convolutional neural network
</title>

<abstract>
According to one implementation, an image processing system includes a computing platform having a hardware processor and a system memory storing a software code including a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained using one or more semantic map(s). The hardware processor executes the software code to receive an original image including multiple object images each identified with one of multiple object classes, and to generate replications of the original image, each replication corresponding respectively to one of the object classes. The hardware processor further executes the software code to, for each replication, selectively modify one or more object image(s) identified with the object class corresponding to the replication, using the CNN, to produce partially modified images each corresponding respectively to an object class, and to merge the partially modified images, using the CNN, to generate a modified image corresponding to the original image.

<claims>
1. An image processing system comprising: a computing platform including a hardware processor and a system memory; a software code stored in the system memory, the software code including a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained using at least one semantic map; the hardware processor configured to execute the software code to: receive an original image including a plurality of object images each identified with one of a plurality of object classes; generate a plurality of replications of the original image, each replication corresponding respectively to one of the plurality of object classes; for each replication, selectively modify at least one object image identified with the respective one corresponding object class, using the CNN, to produce a plurality of partially modified images corresponding respectively to the plurality of object classes; and merge the plurality of partially modified images, using the CNN, to generate a modified image corresponding to the original image.
2. The image processing system of claim 1, wherein the CNN is configured to produce the plurality of partially modified images, and to merge the plurality of partially modified images to generate the modified image, without using a semantic map of the original image.
3. The image processing system of claim 1, wherein the CNN comprises a multi-stream semantic network (MSN) including a semantic streaming stage followed in series by a fusion stage.
4. The image processing system of claim 3, wherein the semantic streaming stage and the fusion stage are trained independently of one another, using the at least one semantic map.
5. The image processing system of claim 3, wherein the semantic streaming stage includes a plurality of parallel semantic streams, and wherein the plurality of parallel semantic streams are trained independently of one another.
6. The image processing system of claim 5, wherein each of the plurality of parallel semantic streams corresponds to a respective one of the plurality of object classes.
7. The image processing system of claim 1, wherein the modified image comprises a super-resolution image corresponding to the original image.
8. The image processing system of claim 1, wherein the original image corresponds to a ground-truth image, and wherein the modified image is a restored image more similar to the ground-truth image than the original image is.
9. The image processing system of claim 1, wherein the modified image comprises an image that is at least one of deblurred and denoised relative to the original image.
10. The image processing system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of partially modified images comprises up to one hundred partially modified images.
11. A method for use by an image processing system including a computing platform having a hardware processor and a system memory storing a software code including a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained using at least one semantic map, the method comprising: receiving, using the hardware processor, an original image including a plurality of object images each identified with one of a plurality of object classes; generating, using the hardware processor, a plurality of replications of the original image, each replication corresponding respectively to one of the plurality of object classes; for each replication, selectively enhancing, using the hardware processor and the CNN, at least one object image identified with the respective one corresponding object class, to produce a plurality of partially modified images corresponding respectively to the plurality of object classes; and merging, using the hardware processor and the CNN, the plurality of partially modified images to generate a modified image corresponding to the original image.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the CNN is configured to produce the plurality of partially modified images, and to merge the plurality of partially modified images to generate the modified image, without using a semantic map of the original image.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the CNN comprises a multi-stream semantic network (MSN) including a semantic streaming stage followed in series by a fusion stage.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the semantic streaming stage and the fusion stage are trained independently of one another, using the at least one semantic map.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein the semantic streaming stage includes a plurality of parallel semantic streams, and wherein the plurality of parallel semantic streams are trained independently of one another.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein each of the plurality of parallel semantic streams corresponds to a respective one of the plurality of object classes.
17. The method of claim 11, wherein the modified image comprises a super-resolution image corresponding to the original image.
18. The method of claim 11, wherein the original image corresponds to a ground-truth image, and wherein the modified image is a restored image more similar to the ground-truth image than the original image is.
19. The method of claim 11, wherein the modified image comprises an image that is at least one of deblurred and denoised relative to the original image.
20. The method of claim 11, wherein the plurality of partially modified images comprises up to one hundred partially modified images.
