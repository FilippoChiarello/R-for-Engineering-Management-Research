<title>
SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DRIVEN SMART TEMPLATE
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure describes systems and methods for using a template for a simulated phishing campaign, A database includes a plurality of templates for simulated phishing campaigns, each template of the plurality of templates identifying a list of a plurality of types of simulated phishing communications and at least a portion of content for the simulated phishing communications. A campaign controller selects a template from the plurality of templates for a simulated phishing campaign directed to a user of a plurality of users; and communicates, to one or more devices of the user a first type of simulated phishing communication of the plurality of types of simulated phishing communications with at least the portion of content identified by the template.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising: identifying, by one or more processors, a plurality of templates to use for communicating a plurality of simulated phishing communications, each template of the plurality of templates identifying an ordered list of a plurality of types of simulated phishing communications to be communicated in accordance with one or more time intervals; selecting, by the one or more processors, a template from the plurality of templates; and communicating, by the one or more processors, to one or more devices of the user each of the types of simulated phishing communications in accordance with the ordered list and the one or more time intervals.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising communicating, by the one or more processors, each of the types of simulated phishing communications until the user falls for a simulated phishing communication of the plurality of simulated phishing communications.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising communicating, by the one or more processors, each of the types of simulated phishing communications until a simulated phishing communication of the plurality of simulated phishing communications causes the user to take an action.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising communicating, by the one or more processors, each of the types of simulated phishing communications in turn based on the one or time intervals, the one or more time intervals varying between at least a first type of simulated phishing communication and a second type of simulated phishing communication of the types of simulated phishing communications.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein each template of the plurality of templates identifies a different ordered list of the plurality of types of simulated phishing communications different from another template.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the each of the types of simulated phishing communications comprise one or more of the following: an email, a text or short message service (SMS) message, a phone call or an Internet based communication.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising selecting, by the one or more processors, the template based on at least the user.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising selecting, by the one or more processors, the template on at least one of attributes of or a profile of the user.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising selecting, by the one or more processors, the template based at least on one of the following: an industry of a company of the user, a geographic region of the user, a demographic of the user or an organizational level within the company of the user.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising selecting, by the one or more processors, the template using a model applied to results of previous simulated phishing communications.
11. A system comprising: one or more processors, coupled to memory and configured to: identify a plurality of templates to use for communicating a plurality of simulated phishing communications, each template of the plurality of templates identifying an ordered list of a plurality of types of simulated phishing communications to be communicated in accordance with one or more time intervals; select a template from the plurality of templates; and communicate to one or more devices of the user each of the types of simulated phishing communications in accordance with the ordered list and the one or more time intervals.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to communicate each of the types of simulated phishing communications until the user falls for a simulated phishing communication of the plurality of simulated phishing communications.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to communicate each of the types of simulated phishing communications until a simulated phishing communication of the plurality of simulated phishing communications causes the user to take an action.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to communicate each of the types of simulated phishing communications in turn based on the one or tine intervals, wherein the one or more time intervals vary between at least a first type of simulated phishing communication and a second type of simulated phishing communication of the types of simulated phishing communications.
15. The system of claim 11, wherein each template of the plurality of templates identifies a different ordered list of the plurality of types of simulated phishing communications different from another template.
16. The system of claim 11, wherein the each of the types of simulated phishing communications comprise one or more of the following: an email, a text or short message service (SMS) message, a phone call or an Internet based communication.
17. The system of claim 11, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to select the template based on at least the user.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to select the template on at least one of attributes of or a profile of the user.
19. The system of claim 11, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to select the template based at least on one of the following: an industry of a company of the user, a geographic region of the user, a demographic of the user or an organizational level within the company of the user.
20. The system of claim 11, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to select the template using a model applied to results of previous simulated phishing communications.
