TRAVEL CONTROL APPARATUS, TRAVEL CONTROL METHOD AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT
</title>

<abstract>
A travel control apparatus D is an apparatus having an avoidance steering function for controlling steering so as to avoid contact and/or abnormal approach of a host vehicle with respect to another vehicle traveling in a lane that is a destination of change when the host vehicle changes lanes. The travel control apparatus D includes: a radar apparatus 1 and a detection processing unit 52 serving as one example of an other-vehicle detecting unit configured to detect whether the other vehicle is present and further detect a movement of the other vehicle when the other vehicle is present; and a function stopping unit 54 configured to stop the avoidance steering function when one of a case where a position of the other vehicle after an elapse of a predetermined period acquired based on a detection result of the radar apparatus 1 and the detection processing unit 52 is in a determination region that is a region extending in an extending direction of a host lane, on a vehicle-width-direction outer side of the host vehicle, and in the host lane, and a case where the position of the other vehicle has passed the determination region occurs, the host lane being a lane in which the host vehicle travels.

<claims>
1. A travel control apparatus (D) having an avoidance steering function for controlling steering, when a host vehicle (VCs) changes lanes, so as to avoid contact and/or abnormal approach of the host vehicle (VCs) with respect to another vehicle traveling in a lane that is a destination of change for the host vehicle (VCs), the travel control apparatus (D) comprising: an other-vehicle detecting unit (1, 52) configured to detect whether the other vehicle is present and further detect a movement of the other vehicle when the other vehicle is present; and a function stopping unit (54) configured to stop the avoidance steering function in one of the following cases: a position of the other vehicle after an elapse of a specified time period is in a determination region, the specified time period being acquired based on a detection result of the other-vehicle detecting unit (1, 52), the determination region being a region that is in a host lane on an outer side of the host vehicle (VCs) in a vehicle-width-direction and that extends in an extending direction of the host lane, the host lane being a lane in which the host vehicle (VCs) travels; or the position of the other vehicle has passed the determination region.
2. The travel control apparatus (D) according to claim 1, wherein the determination region is set ahead of the host vehicle (VCs) and/or behind the host vehicle (VCs).
3. The travel control apparatus (D) according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the function stopping unit (54) is further configured to stop the avoidance steering function when, based on the detection result of the other-vehicle detecting unit (1, 52), the other vehicle is present on a side of the host vehicle (VCs) in a direction opposite from a direction of lane change of the host vehicle (VCs).
4. The travel control apparatus (D) according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein: the movement of the other vehicle is expressed by a relative speed vector; and the function stopping unit (54) is further configured not to stop the avoidance steering function when, based on the detection result of the other-vehicle detecting unit (1, 52), a distance between the host vehicle (VCs) and the other vehicle continues to be equal to or more than a predetermined threshold for a predetermined time period.
5. A travel control method having an avoidance steering function for controlling steering, when a host vehicle (VCs) changes lanes, so as to avoid contact and/or abnormal approach of a host vehicle with respect to another vehicle traveling in a lane that is a destination of change for the host vehicle, the travel control method comprising: an other-vehicle detecting step of detecting whether the other vehicle is present and further detecting a movement of the other vehicle when the other vehicle is present; and a function stopping step of stopping the avoidance steering function in one of the following cases: a position of the other vehicle after an elapse of a specified time period is in a determination region, the specified time period being acquired based on a detection result of the other-vehicle detecting step, the determination region being a region that is in a host lane on an outer side of the host vehicle (VCs) in a vehicle-width-direction and that extends in an extending direction of the host lane, the host lane being a lane in which the host vehicle (VCs) travels; or the position of the other vehicle has passed the determination region.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the determination region is set ahead of the host vehicle (VCs) and/or behind the host vehicle (VCs).
7. The method according to claim 5 or claim 6, wherein the function stopping step further includes:
stopping the avoidance steering function when, based on the detection result of the other-vehicle detecting unit (1, 52), the other vehicle is present on a side of the host vehicle (VCs) in a direction opposite from a direction of lane change of the host vehicle (VCs).
8. The method according to any one of claims 5 to 7, wherein: the movement of the other vehicle is expressed by a relative speed vector; and in the function stopping step, the avoidance steering function is not stopped when, based on the detection result of the other-vehicle detecting unit (1, 52), a distance between the host vehicle (VCs) and the other vehicle continues to be equal to or more than a predetermined threshold for a predetermined time period.
9. A computer program product comprising computer-readable instructions that, when loaded and run on a computer, cause the computer to perform the method according to any one of claims 5 to 8.
