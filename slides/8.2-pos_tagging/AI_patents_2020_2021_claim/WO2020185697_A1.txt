SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SUPERVISED LEARNING OF PERMEABILITY OF EARTH FORMATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments herein include a method for characterizing a rock formation sample. The method for characterizing a rock formation sample includes obtaining a plurality of data sets characterizing the rock formation sample. The method further includes training a neural network to generate a computational model. Moreover, the method additionally includes using the plurality of data sets as input to the computational model, wherein the computational model may be implemented by a processor that derives an estimate of permeability of the rock formation sample.
