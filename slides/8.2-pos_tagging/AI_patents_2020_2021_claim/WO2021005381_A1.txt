ANONYMISING ROBOTIC DATA
</title>

<abstract>
A method is provided of anonymising data in a surgical robotic system. The surgical robotic system comprises a robot having a base and an arm extending from the base to an attachment for an instrument, the arm comprising a plurality of joints whereby the configuration of the arm can be altered. The method comprises receiving a data stream captured by the surgical robotic system, the data stream comprising data relating to a surgical procedure and comprising personally-identifiable data; determining one or more personally-identifiable feature in the received data stream; and generating, in dependence on the determined personally-identifiable feature and the received data stream, an anonymised data stream omitting the personally-identifiable data.
