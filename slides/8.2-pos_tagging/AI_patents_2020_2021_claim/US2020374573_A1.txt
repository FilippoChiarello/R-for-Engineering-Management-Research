<title>
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) BASED ENHANCED RESOLUTION CONTENT DELIVERY
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosure relates to a method, that can be executed by an edge delivery node, a set-top-box or a user device, for providing to a user a higher resolution media segment by enhancing a low-resolution media segment. The method comprises obtaining the low-resolution media segment; using a neural network operative to enhance media segments to enhance the low-resolution media segment into the higher resolution media segment; and providing the higher resolution media segment to the user.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for providing to a user a higher resolution media segment by enhancing a low-resolution media segment, comprising: obtaining the low-resolution media segment; using a neural network operative to enhance media segments to enhance the low-resolution media segment into the higher resolution media segment; and providing the higher resolution media segment to the user.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the low-resolution media segment is obtained from a network node.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the network node is an origin server.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the network node is a core or region delivery node of a content delivery network.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein the network node is an edge delivery node of a content delivery network.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the neural network is a deep neural network.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the neural network is a general neural network operative to enhance a broad spectrum of medias.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the neural network is a specialized neural network operative to enhance a category of medias having specific characteristics.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the neural network is a dedicated neural network operative to enhance a specific media or a specific subset of medias.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising obtaining the neural network operative to enhance media segments from a network service.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the method is executed in an edge delivery node of a content delivery network and wherein providing the higher resolution media segment to the user comprises providing the higher resolution media segment to a set-top-box or to a user device ready for playback of the higher resolution media segment.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the method is executed in a set-top-box or in a user equipment, and wherein providing the higher resolution media segment to the user comprises obtaining the higher resolution media segment and playing the higher resolution media segment for the user.
13. (canceled)
14. A set-top-box for providing to a user a higher resolution media segment by enhancing a low-resolution media segment, the set-top-box comprising processing circuits and a memory, the memory containing instructions executable by the processing circuits whereby the set-top-box is operative to: obtain the low-resolution media segment; use a neural network operative to enhance media segments to enhance the low-resolution media segment into the higher resolution media segment; and provide the higher resolution media segment to the user.
15. A user device for providing to a user a higher resolution media segment by enhancing a low-resolution media segment, the user device comprising processing circuits and a memory, the memory containing instructions executable by the processing circuits whereby the user device is operative to: obtain the low-resolution media segment; use a neural network operative to enhance media segments to enhance the low-resolution media segment into the higher resolution media segment; and provide the higher resolution media segment to the user.
16. The user device of claim 15, wherein the low-resolution media segment is obtained from a network node.
17. The user device of claim 15, wherein the network node is an origin server.
18. (canceled)
