<title>
TECHNIQUES FOR CONGESTION MANAGEMENT IN A NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
A switch or network interface can detect congestion caused by a flow of packets. The switch or network interface can generate a congestion hint packet and send the congestion hint packet directly to a source transmitter of the flow of packets that caused the congestion. The congestion hint packet can include information that the source transmitter can use to determine a remedial action to attempt to alleviate or stop congestion at the switch or network interface. For example, the transmitter can reduce a transmit rate of the flow of packets and/or select another route for the flow of packets. Some or all switches or network interfaces between the source transmitter and a destination endpoint can employ flow differentiation whereby a queue is selected to accommodate for a flow's sensitivity to latency.

<claims>
1. A network device comprising: a congestion manager to detect congestion caused by a flow, form a congestion hint message that identifies the congestion causing flow, and cause transmission of the congestion hint message to a transmitter of the flow, the congestion hint message comprising an indication of congestion level and a transmission device to transmit the congestion hint message to the transmitter of the flow independent of transmission to an endpoint destination of the flow.
2. The network device of claim 1, wherein the congestion hint message includes a number of times congestion was detected for the flow.
3. The network device of one of the previous claims, wherein the congestion manager is to determine a latency sensitivity of the flow and select a queue for the flow based on the latency sensitivity of the flow and wherein the latency sensitivity is based on an indication in a header of a packet, the indication comprising a traffic class (TC) associated with the flow.
4. The network device of claim 3, wherein the latency sensitivity is based on a receive rate of the flow, wherein the congestion manager is to identify the flow as a mouse flow and latency sensitive if its receive rate is lower than a threshold or the congestion manager is to identify the flow as an elephant flow and latency insensitive if its receive rate is higher than a second threshold.
5. The network device of one of the previous claims, wherein to transmit the congestion hint message to the transmitter of the flow, the transmission device is to form a packet with a payload that includes the congestion hint message.
6. The network device of claim 5, wherein the payload that includes the congestion hint message comprises one or more of: identification of the network device that detected congestion, an encoded version of an identifier of the flow, an identification of encoding used to encode the identifier, or a requested reduction in transmit rate for the flow.
7. The network device of one of the previous claims, wherein the congestion hint message comprises one or more of: identification of the network device that detected congestion, truncated identifier of the flow, or error protection code.
8. The network device of one of the previous claims, wherein the congestion hint message is to assist the transmitter of the flow to determine whether to reduce a transmit rate of the flow, select another route for the flow to its destination endpoint, or not change a transmit rate or route of the flow.
9. The network device of any of claims 1-8, wherein to transmit the congestion hint message to the transmitter of the flow, the transmission device is to form a packet with a preamble and the preamble includes the congestion hint message.
10. A computer-implemented method comprising: receiving one or more packets associated with a flow; determining whether to queue one or more packets based on whether the flow is latency sensitive or latency insensitive; and based on detection of congestion of the flow, forming a congestion hint message for transmission to a transmitter of the flow, wherein the congestion hint message comprises identification of a network device that detected congestion of the flow and one or more of: number of times the flow has been congested over a period of time, identifier of the flow, or a requested reduction in transmit rate for the flow.
11. The computer-implemented method of claim 10, wherein determining whether to queue one or more packets based on whether the flow is latency sensitive or latency insensitive comprises processing an indication in a header of a packet, the indication comprising a traffic class (TC) associated with the flow.
12. The computer-implemented method of claim 10 or 11, comprising:
transmitting the congestion hint message in a payload of a packet to the transmitter of the flow, wherein the payload comprises one or more of: identification of the network device that detected congestion, an encoded version of an identifier of the flow, an identification of encoding used to encode the identifier, or a requested reduction in transmit rate for the flow.
13. The computer-implemented method of any of claims 10-12, comprising:
transmitting the congestion hint message in a preamble of a packet to the transmitter of the flow, wherein the preamble that includes the congestion hint message comprises one or more of: identification of the network device that detected congestion, truncated identifier of the flow, or error protection code.
14. An endpoint transceiver comprising: a memory and a network interface communicatively coupled to the memory, the network interface to: transmit a flow of packets to a destination endpoint receiver via zero or more network devices and based on receipt of a congestion hint message identifying the flow as a cause of congestion at a network device, applying rate limiting and/or selection of another route based on a congested network device identified in the congestion hint message, wherein the congestion hint message includes at least an indication of congestion level and a number of times congestion was detected for the flow.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the network interface is to receive a packet comprising the congestion hint message, wherein a preamble of the packet includes the congestion hint message and the preamble comprises one or more of: identification of the network device that detected congestion, truncated identifier of the flow, or error protection code.
