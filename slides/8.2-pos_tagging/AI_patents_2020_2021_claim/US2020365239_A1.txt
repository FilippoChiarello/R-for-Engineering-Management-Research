SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL DESIGN DOCUMENT WITH SELECTION OF PATIENT AND INVESTIGATOR
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a system for generating Clinical trial protocol design document with selection of a Patient and an Investigator for a clinical trial process. The system inputs meaningful information derived from the raw data, a pre-Drafted protocol, a regulatory authorities' protocol curated by regulatory authorities, and a pre-stored dataset, present in a repository. A Clinical trial protocol design document is drafted by generating a case frame upon extracting data in form of a key value into a standard document. Each key value is validated and a prediction score is computed based on overlapping of the interim Clinical trial protocol design template with the pre-Drafted protocol and the regulatory authorities' protocol to determine whether the interim Clinical trial protocol design document is approved or rejected. A Clinical trial protocol design document is generated when the interim Clinical trial protocol design document is approved.
