METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING WHEEL LOADER
</title>

<abstract>
In a method of controlling a wheel loader, the wheel loader is moved forwards such that a bucket penetrates into an aggregate to perform an excavation work. Signals able to be used to determine tire slip of the wheel loader are obtained during the excavation work. Prediction algorithms obtained through training are performed to determine whether or not the tire slip occurs. In case of the tire slip, an engine speed is decreased and the bucket is lifted to remove the tire slip. The bucket is moved along a predetermined autonomous excavation trajectory when the tire slip is removed.
