METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RECORDING, PROCESSING, VISUALISATION AND APPLICATION OF AGRONOMICAL DATA
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to methods and devices for a systemic approach to plant-based ecosystem management, including for juxtaposing, processing, organising, and visualizing data relevant to plant-based ecosystems, such as agricultural ecosystems, and delineating external interventions into such systems, such as human interventions, including those with automated machines. Recognizing the time-based—for example, seasonal—nature of plant-based ecosystems, this invention) juxtaposes relevant—but often previously dispersed—data types, 2) organizes them in tensors of customizable dimensions so as to facilitate modeling and in particular deep neural network and other deep machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches that take into account time-based, or other variable-based, changes to identify areas of interest within given land parcels, and 3) visualizes the data so as to highlight time-based, or other variable-based, relationships and trends. Such steps facilitate the development of individual plant or sub-land-parcel prescriptions for human intervention aimed at optimizing ecosystem output traits in the current season while considering their impact on subsequent seasons, thereby enabling the systematic management of plant-based ecosystems.

<claims>
1. A method for creating a plant-based ecosystem for at least a parcel of land, the method comprising collecting data of a plurality of measured variables pertinent to the plant-based ecosystem; normalizing the collected data; organizing the data in a tensor to enable facilitation of an analysis of the data, by unit of time and in multiple layers; storing the data; using the data in an ecosystem model; and storing the output of the ecosystem model.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein for a determined unit of time, the tensor comprises corresponding multiple layers.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the multiple layers are organized in a nested structure, and comprise at a highest level at least one of the list comprising a parcel-level data submatrix; and identified sub-parcels data submatrix, each one of the sub-parcels being a part of the parcel.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the nested structure further comprises linked to the parcel-level data submatrix, a parcel-level specific submatrix including at least one of the list comprising, an abiotic parcel-level observations submatrix; a biotic and climatic parcel-level observations submatrix; an external intervention data submatrix; and a parcel metadata submatrix.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the nested structure further comprises linked to the identified sub-parcels data submatrix, a sub-parcel-level specific submatrix having an individual sub-parcel submatrix.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the nested structure further comprises linked to the individual sub-parcel submatrix, an individual sub-parcel specific submatrix including one of the list comprising an abiotic sub-parcel-level observation submatrix; a biotic sub-parcel-level observations submatrix; a sub-parcel-level reflectance observations submatrix; a sub-parcel-level metadata submatrix; and a sub-parcel-level external interventions observations submatrix; wherein the number of submatrices comprised in the individual sub-parcel specific submatrix is determined by the number of the plurality of variables for which data are measured.
7. The method of claim 1 further comprising the steps of: processing of the data collected and further data gathered, based on the ecosystem model, and outputting desired ecosystem output parameters.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the parcel or sub-parcel data are displayed graphically in a combined way that pivots a stack of juxtaposed graphs, each representing parcel or sub-parcel data, about a center so as to create a circle; the degrees of the circle and corresponding concentric circles of various data types to be represented by one of the list comprising: the time unit; an abiotic observation; a biotic observation; an external intervention; and a reflectance.
9. An apparatus for creating an agricultural plant-based ecosystem for at least a parcel of land, comprising a computational device; a distributed computing infrastructure; a data storage device; and a data collection device configured to make a collection of data of a plurality of measured variables pertinent to the plant-based ecosystem; wherein the computational device is configured to gather further data from an intended plurality of data sources comprising at least one of the list comprising a satellite imaging system, an airborne imaging system, and a terrestrial sensor network; wherein the distributed computing infrastructure is configured to connect the computational device to at least the data storage device; and wherein the computation device is further configured to process the data collected and the further data gathered, based on an ecosystem model, and to output desired ecosystem output parameters.
10. The apparatus of claim 9, comprising a circular representation of graphical data collected such that one variable is rotated and the other variables form concentric circles leading out from the center and the values of the rotated variable form radii of the circle.
