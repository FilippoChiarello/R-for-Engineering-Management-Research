Implants using ultrasonic waves for stimulating tissue
</title>

<abstract>
Described herein are implantable devices configured to emit an electrical pulse. An exemplary implantable device includes an ultrasonic transducer configured to receive ultrasonic waves that power the implantable device and encode a trigger signal; a first electrode and a second electrode configured to be in electrical communication with a tissue and emit an electrical pulse to the tissue in response to the trigger signal; and an integrated circuit comprising an energy storage circuit. Also described are systems that include one or more implantable device and an interrogator configured to operate the one or more implantable devices. Further described is a closed loop system that includes a first device configured to detect a signal, an interrogator configured to emit a trigger signal in response to the detected signal, and an implantable device configured to emit an electrical pulse in response to receiving the trigger signal. Further described are computer systems useful for operating one or more implantable devices, as well as methods of electrically stimulating a tissue.

<claims>
1. An interrogator, comprising: one or more ultrasonic transducers; one or more processors; a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing one or more programs configured to be executed by the one or more processors, the one or more programs comprising instructions for: (i) configuring the interrogator to receive, at the one or more ultrasonic transducers, ultrasonic backscatter encoding a physiological signal emitted from an implantable device; (ii) configuring the one or more processors to detect the physiological signal from the ultrasonic backscatter received at the one or more ultrasonic transducers; and (iii) causing the one or more ultrasonic transducers to emit ultrasonic waves encoding a trigger signal that signals the implantable device to emit an electrical pulse to a tissue, wherein the one or more ultrasonic transducers emit the ultrasonic waves encoding the trigger signal in response to the physiological signal.
2. The interrogator of claim 1, wherein the physiological signal comprises an electrophysiological signal.
3. The interrogator of claim 1, wherein the physiological signal comprises a temperature.
4. The interrogator of claim 1, wherein the physiological signal comprises an amount of an analyte.
5. The interrogator of claim 1, wherein the physiological signal comprises pH.
6. The interrogator of claim 1, wherein the physiological signal comprises pressure, strain, or bioimpedance.
7. The interrogator of claim 1, wherein the one or more programs comprise instructions for determining a location of the implantable device relative to the one or more ultrasonic transducers of the interrogator.
8. The interrogator of claim 1, wherein the one or more programs comprise instructions for determining movement of the implantable device relative to the one or more ultrasonic transducers of the interrogator.
9. The interrogator of claim 1, wherein the interrogator is implantable.
10. The interrogator of claim 9, wherein the interrogator is configured to communicate with an external device using electromagnetic waves or radiofrequency waves.
11. The interrogator of claim 1, wherein the interrogator is wearable by a subject.
12. The interrogator of claim 11, wherein the interrogator comprises a strap or an adhesive.
13. The interrogator of claim 1, wherein the one or more programs comprises instructions for beam steering the ultrasonic waves emitted by the one or more transducers.
14. The interrogator of claim 1, wherein the one or more programs comprises instructions for deconvoluting ultrasonic backscatter form a plurality of implantable devices.
15. The interrogator of claim 1, wherein the trigger signal comprises information relating to the electrical pulse to be emitted by the implantable device.
16. The interrogator of claim 15, wherein the information relating to the electrical pulse comprises a frequency, an amplitude, a pulse length, or a pulse shape.
17. A system comprising the interrogator of claim 1, and the implantable device.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the system comprises a plurality of implantable devices configured to communicate with the interrogator through ultrasonic waves.
19. The interrogator of claim 1, where the one or more processors comprise one or more central processing units (CPUs), one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), or one or more microcontroller units (MCUs).
20. The interrogator of claim 1, wherein the interrogator is an external device.
21. The interrogator of claim 1, wherein the interrogator is configured to be subcutaneously implanted.
22. The interrogator of claim 1, wherein the interrogator is configured to be subcranially implanted.
