GENERAL AND PERSONAL PATIENT RISK PREDICTION
</title>

<abstract>
Various embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a general statistical classifier (40) and a personal statistical classifier (50) for executing a patient risk prediction method. In operation, the general statistical classifier (40) may render a singular general independent vital sign risk score for a singular vital sign and/or may render plural general independent vital sign risk scores for plural vital signs. The personal statistical classifier (50) may render a singular personal vital sign risk score from an integration of a singular patient feature into the singular general independent vital sign risk score, and/or may also render plural personal independent vital sign risk scores from individual integrations of plural patient features into the singular general independent vital sign risk score, individual integrations of a singular patient feature into the plural general independent vital sign risk scores, and/or individual integrations of plural patient features into the plural general independent vital sign risk scores.
