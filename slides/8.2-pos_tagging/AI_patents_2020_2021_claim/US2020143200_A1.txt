<title>
AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF IMAGES SATISFYING SPECIFIED NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFIER PROPERTIES
</title>

<abstract>
Described is a system for automatically generating images that satisfy specific image properties. Using a code parser component, a tensor expression intermediate representation (IR) of a deep neural network code is produced. A specification describing a set of image properties is parsed in a fixed formal syntax. The tensor expression IR and the specification is input into a rewriting and analysis engine. The rewriting and analysis engine queries an external solver to obtain pixel values satisfying the specification. When pixel values satisfying the specification can be found in a fixed time period, the rewriting and analysis engine combines the pixel values into an image that satisfies the specification and outputs the image.

<claims>
1. A system for automatically generating images, the system comprising: one or more processors and a non-transitory memory having instructions encoded thereon such that when the instructions are executed, the one or more processors perform operations of: producing, with a code parsing component, a tensor expression in the tensor expression intermediate representation (IR) of a deep neural network code; parsing a specification describing a set of image properties in a fixed formal syntax; inputting the tensor expression IR and the specification into a rewriting and analysis engine; querying, by the rewriting and analysis engine, an external solver to obtain pixel values satisfying the specification; and when pixel values satisfying the specification can be found in a fixed time period, combining, by the rewriting and analysis engine, the pixel values into an image that satisfies the specification and outputting the image.
2. The system as set forth in claim 1, wherein the tensor expression IR is implemented as an inductive datatype, such that the tensor expression IR can be traversed recursively.
3. The system as set forth in claim 1, wherein validation of the tensor expression IR is performed at runtime by the code parsing component and the rewriting and analysis engine.
4. The system as set forth in claim 1, wherein the rewriting and analysis engine is configured to perform operations of: rewriting the tensor expression IR to a mathematically equivalent expression; generating a scalar expression from the tensor expression IRs; and querying the external solver with scalar properties of the generated scalar expressions.
5. A computer implemented method for automatically generating images, the method comprising acts of: causing one or more processers to execute instructions encoded on a non-transitory computer-readable medium, such that upon execution, the one or more processors perform operations of: producing, with a code parsing component, a tensor expression in the tensor expression intermediate representation (IR) of a deep neural network code; parsing a specification describing a set of image properties in a fixed formal syntax; inputting the tensor expression IR and the specification into a rewriting and analysis engine; querying, by the rewriting and analysis engine, an external solver to obtain pixel values satisfying the specification; and when pixel values satisfying the specification can be found in a fixed time period, combining, by the rewriting and analysis engine, the pixel values into an image that satisfies the specification and outputting the image.
6. The method as set forth in claim 5, wherein the tensor expression IR is implemented as an inductive datatype, such that the tensor expression IR can be traversed recursively.
7. The method as set forth in claim 5, wherein validation of the tensor expression IR is performed at runtime by the code parsing component and the rewriting and analysis engine.
8. The method as set forth in claim 5, wherein the method further comprises acts of: rewriting, with the rewriting and analysis engine, the tensor expression IR to a mathematically equivalent expression; generating, with the rewriting and analysis engine, a scalar expression from the tensor expression IRs; and querying, with the rewriting and analysis engine, the external solver with scalar properties of the generated scalar expressions.
9. A computer program product for automatically generating images, the computer program product comprising: computer-readable instructions stored on a non-transitory computer-readable medium that are executable by a computer having one or more processors for causing the processor to perform operations of: producing, with a code parsing component, a tensor expression in the tensor expression intermediate representation (IR) of a deep neural network code; parsing a specification describing a set of image properties in a fixed formal syntax; inputting the tensor expression IR and the specification into a rewriting and analysis engine; querying, by the rewriting and analysis engine, an external solver to obtain pixel values satisfying the specification; and when pixel values satisfying the specification can be found in a fixed time period, combining, by the rewriting and analysis engine, the pixel values into an image that satisfies the specification and outputting the image.
10. The computer program product as set forth in claim 9, wherein the tensor expression IR is implemented as an inductive datatype, such that the tensor expression IR can be traversed recursively.
11. The computer program product as set forth in claim 9, wherein validation of the tensor expression IR is performed at runtime by the code parsing component and the rewriting and analysis engine.
12. The computer program product as set forth in claim 9, further comprising instructions for: rewriting, with the rewriting and analysis engine, the tensor expression IR to a mathematically equivalent expression; generating, with the rewriting and analysis engine, a scalar expression from the tensor expression IRs; and querying, with the rewriting and analysis engine, the external solver with scalar properties of the generated scalar expressions.
