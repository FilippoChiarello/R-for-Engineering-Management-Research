<title>
Fraud detection based on an analysis of messages in a messaging account
</title>

<abstract>
A device may obtain a notification that a transaction occurred, where the transaction is associated with a financial account of a user, and a merchant. The device may determine that the merchant is associated with providing confirmation messages for transactions, and may process, based on determining that the merchant is associated with providing confirmation messages, one or more messages in a messaging account associated with the user to determine whether the messaging account includes a confirmation message associated with the transaction. The device may determine that the messaging account does not include any confirmation message associated with the transaction, may determine a likelihood that the transaction was unauthorized based on the messaging account not including a confirmation message, and may perform an action associated with the financial account of the user based on the likelihood that the transaction was unauthorized.

7. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 6, wherein the confirmation message comprises a receipt associated with the transaction.
8. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 6, wherein the one or more instructions, that cause the one or more processors to process the first set of the messages, further cause the one or more processors to: receive a template confirmation message associated with the merchant; and process the first set of the messages to identify, based on the template confirmation message, whether the first set of the messages includes the confirmation message.
9. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 6, wherein the one or more instructions, when executed by the one or more processors, further cause the one or more processors to: determine a likelihood that the transaction is fraudulent based on a characteristic of the transaction; and process the first set of the messages based on the likelihood that the transaction is fraudulent.
10. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 6, wherein the one or more instructions, that cause the one or more processors to perform the action, cause the one or more processors to: after the first threshold time period, process a second set of the messages to identify whether the second set of the messages includes the confirmation message, wherein the second set of the messages were received by the messaging account within a second threshold time period that expires after the first threshold time period; determine whether the second set of the messages includes the confirmation message; and perform a further action associated with the financial account based on whether the second set of the messages includes the confirmation message.
11. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 10, wherein the one or more instructions, that cause the one or more processors to perform the further action, cause the one or more processors to: prevent any future transactions associated with the financial account, or flag the financial account as potentially compromised by an unauthorized user.
12. A method, comprising: receiving, by a device, access information that permits access to messages associated with a messaging account of a user; detecting, by the device, that a transaction occurred, wherein the transaction is associated with: a financial account of the user, and a merchant; determining, by the device, that the merchant is associated with providing confirmation messages for transactions; pre-processing, by the device, a plurality of messages in the messaging account, based on determining that the merchant is associated with providing confirmation messages and based on one or more characteristics of the messages and one or more characteristics of the transaction, to filter at least one message from the plurality of messages and identify one or more messages, of the plurality of messages, for further processing; monitoring, by the device, based on the access information, the messaging account to determine whether the messaging account receives a confirmation message, wherein the monitoring is based on detecting the transaction, and wherein the monitoring includes processing, based on the pre-processing, the one or more messages in the messaging account to identify the confirmation message, wherein the one or more messages are processed using at least one technique, wherein the at least one technique includes one or more of: an image processing technique that comprises at least one of: an optical character recognition technique, or a computer vision technique, a text processing technique that comprises a natural language processing technique, or a code processing technique that comprises analyzing computer code associated with the confirmation message; determining, by the device and based on processing the one or more messages using the at least one technique, whether the messaging account received the confirmation message within a threshold time period associated with the transaction; determining, by the device, a probability that the transaction is fraudulent based on determining that the messaging account did not receive the confirmation message; and performing, by the device, an action based on the probability that the transaction is fraudulent.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising: identifying a characteristic of the transaction that indicates that the transaction is potentially fraudulent, wherein the monitoring is further based on identifying the characteristic.
14. The method of claim 12, wherein determining that the merchant is associated with providing confirmation messages comprises: identifying that the merchant has provided a previous confirmation message for a previous transaction; and determining, based on identifying that the merchant provided the previous confirmation message, that the merchant is associated with providing confirmation messages.
15. The method of claim 12, wherein performing the action comprises, flagging the financial account to prevent a future transaction associated with the financial account when the messaging account is determined to not include the confirmation message, or performing a fraud analysis when the messaging account is determined to include the confirmation message.
16. The method of claim 12, wherein performing the action comprises: sending a notification to the messaging account when the messaging account is determined to not include the confirmation message, wherein the notification indicates at least one of: that the transaction occurred, or a likelihood of fraudulent activity associated with the financial account.
17. The method of claim 12, further comprising: obtaining, from a data structure and based on the merchant, a template confirmation message; and processing the one or more messages comprises: processing the one or more messages, using the template confirmation message, to determine whether the messaging account includes the confirmation message.
