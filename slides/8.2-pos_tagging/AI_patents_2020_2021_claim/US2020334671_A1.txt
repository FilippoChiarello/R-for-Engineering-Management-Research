<abstract>
A system manages payments by an entity to its partners (suppliers, service providers, etc.) by providing an intermediary capability to disaggregate and regenerate payment orders using real time inputs from the payee. A single obligation may be split into different payments to different institutions and payment vehicles such as prepaid cards, countries, and currencies. An Al predictive function may reduce foreign currency transfers and their associated costs by recognizing intra-divisional, intracompany and intercompany assets and liabilities to allow in-country net settlements to be made prior to using a foreign currency transfer. When needed, foreign currency transfers may be aggregated to reduce the volume and velocity of those transfers. Tokenization of financial data and accounts may further protect activity between payors, payees, and financial institutions.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A system comprising: a core that receives signals from a plurality of sensors in a plurality of networks supporting a data flow between a first party and one or more second parties; a first portal that interfaces between the first party and the core; and a second portal that interfaces between a recipient associated with the one or more second parties and the core; wherein the first portal receives a value transfer message for use in the plurality of networks, and wherein the second portal provides a user interface for the recipient to specify conditions for the data flow.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the core further comprises a manager that determines status of first party accounts and obligations in individual countries and exhausts in-country settlement options prior to performing an international transfer.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein exhausting in-country settlement options includes evaluating alternate funding options.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein evaluating alternate funding options includes non-bank third party currency sources.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the core further supports a data storage system that maintains a cryptographically validated log of events related to activities supported by the core.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the cryptographic validated log is a private blockchain.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the core further supports an artificial intelligence engine.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the first portal provides a second user interface for a second recipient to specify conditions for the data flow.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the second portal interfaces between a second party and the core, the second portal receiving payment messages from the second party.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the value transfer message corresponds to a currency-based transaction.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the value transfer message corresponds to a transfer of a real asset.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein the value transfer message corresponds to transfer of a digital asset.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the digital asset is one of a digital currency, an escrowed value, and a cryptographic key.
14. The system of claim 1, wherein the core further comprises a value added application.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the value added application is one of a risk calculation and a balance test.
16. The system of claim 1, wherein the core further comprises an application program interface (API) installed on a user device, the API supporting a user interface that receives one or more options and causes the system to reprogram the second portal according to the one or more options received via the user interface.
17. A system comprising: a processor and memory, the processor configured to execute instructions stored in the memory; a network interface coupled to the processor, the network interface configured to send and receive messages with external entities; a user interface coupled to the processor; the processor implementing a database system that generates a compliant message for implementing a transfer responsive to instructions received via the user interface; a module for compliant message content verification; a module for compliant message disaggregation that generates disaggregated data; and a module for message regeneration that generates one or more order files based on application of payee preferences to the disaggregated data.
18. A method of settling obligations in a country comprising: receiving a payment obligation from a first source, receiving a cash balance for the first source in at least one country; calculating, at a processor, a first volume and velocity trend on the payment obligation; calculating a second volume and velocity trend on the cash balance; predicting a future cash position at the at least one country based on the first volume and velocity trend for obligations and the second volume and velocity trend for cash balances; and transferring funds from an account in a first country to the at least one country based on the predicted future cash position.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein transferring funds from an account in the first country to the at least one country comprises transferring funds from a non-bank account in the first country to a bank account in the at least one country when the predicted future cash position shows a future shortage of cash at the first source.
20. The method of claim 18, wherein the first country and the at least one country are the same country.
