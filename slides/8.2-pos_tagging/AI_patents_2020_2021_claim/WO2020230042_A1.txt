A COMPUTER IMPLEMENTED SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING AN OPTIMAL ROUTE AND A METHOD THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention envisages a computer implemented system (100) for determining an optimal route for a transportation service for a new route. The system (100) is configured to perform the steps of: gathering, at a cloud server (104), data from a plurality of data sources (102-1, 102-2,..., 102-n) pertaining to a set of factors affecting starting of a new route for a 5 return service between at least two locations, the plurality of data sources (102-1, 102-2,..., 102-n) including at least one real-time data source, and creating a data pool (106) from gathered data and processing the gathered data from the data pool (106) by employing at least one machine learning technique and based on at least one historical trend to provide an optimal route determination score for the return service.

<claims>
1. A computer implemented system (100) for determining an optimal route for a transportation service, said system (100) configured to perform the steps of:
• gathering, at a cloud server (104), data from a plurality of data sources (102-1, 102-2, ..., 102-n) pertaining to a set of factors affecting starting of a new route for a return service between at least two locations, said plurality of data sources (102-1, 102-2, ..., 102-n) including at least one real-time data source, and creating a data pool (106) from gathered data; and
• processing said gathered data from said data pool (106) by employing at least one machine learning technique and based on at least one historical trend to provide an optimal route determination score for said return service.
2. The computer implemented system (100) as claimed in claim 1, wherein said processing is based on at least one input derived from a variance between said optimal route determination score and actual profitability in operation, wherein the system (100) is configured to capture said at least one input and modify said set of factors.
3. The computer implemented system (100) as claimed in claim 1, wherein said factors are selected from the group consisting of transportation cost, region-wise daily fuel pricing, daily currency exchange rate, ticket pricing of existing transportation services between said at least two locations, destination type, user expenditure behavior at said at least two locations, and number of users using existing transportation services between said at least two locations.
4. The computer implemented system (100) as claimed in claim 1, wherein said system (100) is configured to provide comparative route determination analysis for two or more routes.
5. The computer implemented system (100) as claimed in claim 1, wherein said transportation service is selected from the group consisting of airline service, road transport service, railroad service, and water transport service.
6. The computer implemented system (100) as claimed in claim 1, wherein said processing includes employing mind map analysis for each of said set of factors.
7. The computer implemented system (100) as claimed in claim 6, wherein said processing includes consolidating mind map analysis performed for said each of said set of factors.
8. The computer implemented system (100) as claimed in claim 1, wherein said system (100) is configured to modify said set of factors based on type of said transportation service. 9. A computer implemented method (200) for determining an optimal route for a transportation service, said method (200) comprising the steps of:
• gathering (202) data from a plurality of data sources pertaining to a set of factors affecting starting of a new route for a return service between at least two locations;
• creating (204) a data pool from gathered data;
· processing (206) said gathered data from said data pool by employing at least one machine learning technique; and
• providing (208) an optimal route determination score for said return service based on at least one historical trend.
10. The computer implemented method (200) as claimed in claim 9, wherein said plurality of data sources includes at least one of a real-time data source, a historical data source and a human input derived from a variance between said optimal route determination score and actual profitability in operation.
11. The computer implemented method (200) as claimed in claim 9, wherein said human input is captured to modify said set of factors based on said variance.
