<title>
BLOCKCHAIN-BASED DISTRIBUTION OF MEDICAL DATA RECORDS
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a method for providing an uniform resource locator, comprising the step of receiving a medical data record with an interface, wherein the medical data record is related to a patient, the step of determining the uniform resource locater related to the medical data record with a computation unit, wherein the uniform resource locator comprises an authorization token based on the medical data record, and wherein the medical data record can be accessed by following the uniform resource locator, and the step of providing the uniform resource locator with the interface to the patient.The inventors recognized that by providing a uniform resource locator comprising an authorization token access to the medical data record can be granted fast and efficient, e.g. by a patient forwarding the uniform resource locator to another entity (e.g. a physician), while at the same time non-authorized entities cannot access the medical data record due to their lack of the suitable authorization token.
