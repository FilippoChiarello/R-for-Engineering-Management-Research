APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR OPERATING A PERSONAL GROOMING APPLIANCE OR HOUSEHOLD CLEANING APPLIANCE
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for operating a personal grooming/household appliance, including: providing a personal grooming/household appliance including at least one physical sensor taken from a group consisting of: an orientation sensor, an acceleration sensor, an inertial sensor, a global positioning sensor, a pressure sensor, and a load sensor, audio sensor, humidity sensor, and a temperature sensor; providing a camera associated with the personal grooming/household appliance; classifying data received from the physical sensor and from the camera using at least one trained machine learning classifier to generate an augmented classification; and providing user feedback information based upon the augmented classification or modifying operation of the grooming/household appliance based upon the augmented classification.
</abstract>

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method for operating a personal grooming appliance, comprising:
providing a personal grooming appliance including,
a powered and electronically controlled grooming implement, and at least one physical sensor taken from a group consisting of: an orientation sensor, an acceleration sensor, an inertial sensor, a global positioning sensor, a pressure sensor, a load sensor, audio sensor, humidity sensor, and a temperature sensor;
providing a camera associated with the personal grooming appliance;
deriving an augmented classification using one or more classifiers classifying the physical sensor data and the image data; and
modifying operation of the grooming implement based upon the augmented classification.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the camera is located on the personal grooming appliance.
3. The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein:
the personal grooming appliance further includes a computer network interface transmitting and receiving data over a computer network;
the camera is located on a computerized device that includes a computer network interface at least transmitting image data over the computer network.
4. The method according to claim 3, wherein the operation modifying step is further based upon a treatment plan implemented by a software application operating, at least in part, on the computerized device, and wherein the treatment plan is customized for a user of the grooming appliance
5. The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the step of deriving the augmented classification is performed by a single classifier.
6. The method according to any one of the preceding claims, further comprising:
classifying sensor data received from the physical sensor using a trained machine learning classifier to generate a physical classification; and
classifying image data received from the camera using a trained machine learning classifier to generate an image classification;
wherein the step of deriving the augmented classification is based upon the combination of the physical classification and the image classification.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein:
the personal grooming appliance is a dental appliance;
the grooming implement is at least one of a brush, a fluid nozzle and a flossing tape; and the augmented classification pertains to the position of the grooming implement with respect to a user's mouth.
8. The method according to claim 7, wherein the modifying operation step deactivates the grooming implement when the augmented classification indicates that the grooming implement is outside of the user's mouth.
9. The method according to claim 7, wherein the grooming implement is a motorized brush and the modifying operation adjusts a brush speed setting based upon the position of the grooming implement with respect to the user's mouth as indicated, at least in part, by the augmented classification.
10. The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the augmented classification pertains, at least in part, to whether or not the grooming implement is being implemented, and the step of modifying operation updates a maintenance setting based upon an amount of time that the grooming implement is being implemented.
11. The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the augmented classification pertains, at least in part, to the position of the grooming implement with respect to a user's body part, and the step of modifying operation modifies operation of the grooming implement, based at least in part, upon the position of the of the grooming implement with respect to the user's body part as indicated, at least in part, by the augmented classification.
12. The method according to claim 11, wherein: The personal grooming appliance is a dental appliance and the grooming implement is a motorized brush; and
the step of modifying operation adjusts at least one of a speed setting and a pressure sensitivity setting of the motorized brush based upon the position of the grooming implement with respect to the user's mouth as indicated, at least in part, by the augmented classification.
13. The method according to claim 11, wherein:
the personal grooming appliance is a shaving appliance and the grooming implement is at least one of motorized shaving head and a shaving cartridge; and
the step of modifying operation adjusts at least one of a speed setting and an angle of attack of the shaving head based upon the position of the grooming implement with respect to the user's face as indicated, at least in part, by the augmented classification.
14. The method according to claim 11, wherein:
the augmented classification further includes a surface condition of the user's body part; and
the step of modifying operation adjusts a performance setting of the grooming implement based upon a surface condition at the position of the grooming implement with respect to the user's face as indicated, at least in part, by the augmented classification.
15. The method according to claim 14, wherein the grooming appliance is a dental appliance and the surface condition pertains, at least in part, to presence of plaque on a user's teeth.
