TRACKING RFID GROUPS WITH SPATIO-TEMPORAL PROXIMITY
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for determining radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag proximity groups are provided. The method includes receiving RFID tag readings from multiple RFID tags. The method includes determining signal strengths of the RFID tag readings. The method includes determining pairs of RFID tags based on the RFID tag readings. The method also includes implementing a twin recurrent neural network (RNN) to determine proximity groups of RFID tags based on distance similarity over time between each of the pairs of the RFID tags.

A method for determining radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag proximity groups, comprising: receiving RFID tag readings from a plurality of RFID tags; determining signal strengths of the RFID tag readings; determining pairs of RFID tags based on the RFID tag readings; and implementing a twin recurrent neural network (RNN) to determine at least one proximity group of RFID tags based on distance similarity over time between each of the pairs of the RFID tags.
2. The method as recited in claim 1, further comprising: before feeding the RFID tag readings as input to the twin RNN, dividing a decision window into multiple time slots, wherein each of the multiple time slots has a duration such that each of the plurality of RFID tags is defined as quasi-stationary.
3. The method as recited in claim 1, further comprising: applying an attention mechanism to summarize the RFID readings in each time slot to ensure that reliable readings are emphasized while filtering out noisy reports.
4. The method as recited in claim 1, further comprising: applying an attention mechanism to compare previous trajectory information with new readings and choose trustworthy new readings that are consistent with the previous trajectory information.
5. The method as recited in claim 1, further comprising: determining the distance similarity over time based on a reference tag.
6. The method as recited in claim 1, further comprising: training the twin RNN towards learning an embedding function f based on a contrastive loss function including both a lower margin (m1) and an upper margin (m2)
