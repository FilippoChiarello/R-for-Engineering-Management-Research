<abstract>
Methods and systems for optimising the quality of visual data. Specifically, methods and systems for preserving visual information during compression and decompression. An example method for optimising visual data includes using a pre-processing hierarchical algorithm to optimise visual data prior to encoding the visual data in visual data processing; and using a post-processing hierarchical algorithm to enhance visual data following decoding visual data in visual data processing.

1. A method of encoding and decoding pixel-based data, the method comprising: using a pre-processing neural network on input pixel-based visual data to produce optimized pixel-based visual data; encoding the optimized pixel-based visual data using an encoder to produce encoded pixel-based visual data; providing the encoded pixel-based visual data and a reference to a post-processing neural network to a decoder; decoding the encoded pixel-based visual data using the decoder to produce decoded pixel-based visual data; and using the post-processing neural network corresponding to the reference to enhance the decoded pixel-based visual data following decoding visual data in visual data processing, wherein the reference identifies a post-processing neural network in a library of neural networks or identifies parameters for a post-processing neural network transmitted with the encoded pixel-based visual data.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the pre-processing neural network and the post-processing neural network have been jointly trained to recreate pixel-based visual data being encoded and decoded.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the pre-processing neural network and the post-processing neural network have been jointly trained using a differential approximation based on a codec used by the encoder and by the decoder.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the pre-processing neural network and the post-processing neural network are jointly trained as a single neural network including a pre-encoder layer; a codec layer; and a post-decoder layer.
5. The method of claim 1, where the input pixel-based visual data comprises two or more frames of pixel-based visual data.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the reference to the post-processing neural network differs at least for a first two or more frames of the input pixel-based visual data and a second two or more frames of the input pixel-based visual data.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising adding the post-processing neural network to the library responsive to the post-processing neural network being transmitted with the encoded pixel-based visual data.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein standardised features of the input pixel-based visual data are extracted and used to select the reference to the post-processing neural network.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the reference to the post-processing neural network is based on generating the highest quality version of the input pixel-based visual data, wherein quality can be defined by any of: an error rate; a bit error rate; a peak signal-to-noise ratio; or a structural similarity index.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the input pixel-based visual data is a portion of each frame in a sequence of frames.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the post-processing neural network uses a learned filter in enhancing the decoded pixel-based visual data.
