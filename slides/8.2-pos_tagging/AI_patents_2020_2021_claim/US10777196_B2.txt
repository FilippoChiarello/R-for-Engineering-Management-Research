<title>
Systems and methods for cooperatively-overlapped and artificial intelligence managed interfaces
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, apparatus, methods, and articles of manufacture for cooperatively-overlapped and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-managed interfaces. For example, multiple cooperatively and/or partially overlapped interfaces may be provided (e.g., via an electronic and/or touch-screen device), with such interfaces being dynamically managed by various AI components, such as natural language processing, machine learning techniques, and/or neural network data processing.

<claims>
1. An intelligent and layered user interface system for providing artificial intelligence feedback to guide an interface experience of a user, comprising: a primary interface generated by a primary interface engine, the primary interface comprising a plurality of primary interface elements; a secondary interface generated by a secondary interface engine, the secondary interface comprising at least one secondary interface element; an electronic processing device; and at least one non-transitory data storage device in communication with the electronic processing device, the at least one non-transitory data storage device storing (i) structured data, (ii) unstructured data, (iii) at least one natural language model, (iv) at least one neural network model, (v) instructions defining a natural language engine, (vi) instructions defining a neural network engine, and (vii) instructions defining a response engine, wherein execution of the (a) instructions defining the natural language engine, (b) instructions defining the neural network engine, and (c) instructions defining the response engine, by the electronic processing device, result in: acquiring, from at least one of the plurality of primary interface elements of the primary interface, at least one user input; analyzing, by the natural language engine and utilizing the at least one natural language model, the at least one user input; defining, by the natural language engine and based on the analyzing of the at least one user input, a predicted intent of the user; analyzing, by the neural network engine and utilizing the at least one neural network model, the predicted intent of the user; defining, by the neural network engine and based on the analyzing of the predicted intent of the user, a query for at least one of the structured data and the unstructured data; querying, utilizing the query for the at least one of the structured data and the unstructured data, the at least one of the structured data and the unstructured data; receiving, in response to the querying, a subset of the at least one of the structured data and the unstructured data; generating, by the response engine and utilizing the predicted intent of the user and the subset of the at least one of the structured data and the unstructured data, a natural language response comprising a sentence that includes data from the subset of the at least one of the structured data and the unstructured data; identifying a position of the at least one of the plurality of primary interface elements of the primary interface; defining, by the secondary interface engine and based on the position of the at least one of the plurality of primary interface elements of the primary interface, at least one of a size and a position of the secondary interface such that the secondary interface selectively overlaps at least a portion of the primary interface, but does not overlap with the at least one of the plurality of primary interface elements of the primary interface; and providing, via the at least one secondary interface element of the secondary interface, the natural language response.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one non-transitory data storage device further stores (viii) a natural language training data set, and wherein execution of the (a) instructions defining the natural language engine, (b) instructions defining the neural network engine, and (c) instructions defining the response engine, by the electronic processing device, further result in: defining, by the natural language engine and utilizing the natural language training data set, the at least one natural language model.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one non-transitory data storage device further stores (viii) a neural network training data set, and wherein execution of the (a) instructions defining the natural language engine, (b) instructions defining the neural network engine, and (c) instructions defining the response engine, by the electronic processing device, further result in: defining, by the neural network engine and utilizing the neural network training data set, the at least one neural network model.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the at least one non-transitory data storage device further stores (ix) at least one topic model, and wherein execution of the (a) instructions defining the natural language engine, (b) instructions defining the neural network engine, and (c) instructions defining the response engine, by the electronic processing device, further result in: selecting, by the neural network engine and utilizing the at least one topic model, the neural network training data set from a plurality of available neural network training data sets.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one user input comprises data defining an underwriting action.
