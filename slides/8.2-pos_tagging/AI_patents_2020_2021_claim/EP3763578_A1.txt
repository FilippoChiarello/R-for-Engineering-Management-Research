VEHICLE-MOUNTED EQUIPMENT CONTROL DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle-mounted equipment control device includes a control unit 33 that causes equipment of any of a headlight 21, a wiper 22, and an air-conditioning device 23 to continue a visual securing operation for securing visibility of a driver of a vehicle 100 even after driving control of the vehicle 100 is switched from automated driving control to manual driving control regardless of an operation mode of the equipment specified by an operation unit (16a to 16c) for setting an operation of the equipment when an operation mode executed by the equipment immediately before driving control of the vehicle 100 is switched from automated driving control to manual driving control is an operation mode corresponding to the visual securing operation.

<claims>
1. A vehicle-mounted equipment control device, comprising:
a control unit that causes equipment of any of a headlight, a wiper, and an air-conditioning device to continue a visual securing operation for securing visibility of a driver of a vehicle even after driving control of the vehicle is switched from automated driving control to manual driving control regardless of an operation mode of the equipment specified by an operation unit for setting an operation of the equipment when an operation mode executed by the equipment immediately before driving control of the vehicle is switched from automated driving control to manual driving control is an operation mode corresponding to the visual securing operation.
2. The vehicle-mounted equipment control device according to claim 1, wherein the equipment is a headlight, and the control unit changes an operation mode of the headlight to an operation mode specified by the operation unit when illuminance measured by an illumination sensor installed in the vehicle is equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold value after driving control of the vehicle is switched from automated driving control to manual driving control.
3. The vehicle-mounted equipment control device according to claim 1, wherein the equipment is a wiper, and the control unit changes an operation mode of the wiper to an operation mode specified by the operation unit when a speed of the vehicle measured by a speed sensor installed in the vehicle is equal to or less than a predetermined speed and a position of a shift lever of the vehicle is a position in which power of the vehicle is not transmitted to a wheel of the vehicle or when a rainfall amount measured by a rain sensor is equal to or less than a predetermined threshold value after driving control of the vehicle is switched from automated driving control to manual driving control.
4. The vehicle-mounted equipment control device according to claim 1, wherein the equipment is an air-conditioning device, and the control unit changes an operation mode of the air-conditioning device to an operation mode specified by the operation unit when a predetermined period elapses since driving control of the vehicle is switched from automated driving control to manual driving control.
5. The vehicle-mounted equipment control device according to claim 1, wherein the equipment is a headlight, and the control unit detects an oncoming vehicle and a lighting situation of a headlight of the oncoming vehicle from each of a plurality of time-series images acquired by an imaging unit installed in the vehicle in the latest certain period after driving control of the vehicle is switched from automated driving control to manual driving control, and changes an operation mode of the headlight to an operation mode specified by the operation unit when a ratio of the number of oncoming vehicles whose headlight is ON to a total number of detected oncoming vehicles in the certain period is equal to or less than a predetermined proportion.
6. The vehicle-mounted equipment control device according to claim 1, wherein the equipment is a wiper, and the control unit detects an oncoming vehicle and an operation situation of a wiper of the oncoming vehicle from each of a plurality of time-series images acquired by an imaging unit installed in the vehicle in the latest certain period after driving control of the vehicle is switched from automated driving control to manual driving control, and changes an operation mode of the wiper to an operation mode specified by the operation unit when a ratio of the number of oncoming vehicles whose wiper is operating to a total number of detected oncoming vehicles in the certain period is equal to or less than a predetermined proportion.
7. A vehicle-mounted equipment control device, comprising
a control unit that determines whether or not a set operation mode specified by an operation unit for setting an operation of equipment of any of a headlight and a wiper coincides with an execution operation mode executed by the equipment during execution of automated driving control with respect to a vehicle, and notifies a driver of the vehicle that the set operation mode and the execution operation mode are different via a notification unit when the set operation mode and the execution operation mode are different.
