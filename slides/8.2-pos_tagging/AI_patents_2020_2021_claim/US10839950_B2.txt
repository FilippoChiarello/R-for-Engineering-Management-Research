<title>
Platform and system for digital personalized medicine
</title>

<abstract>
The digital personalized medicine system uses digital data to assess or diagnose symptoms of a subject to provide personalized or more appropriate therapeutic interventions and improved diagnoses. The use of prioritized questions and answers with associated feature importance can be used to assess mental function and allow a subject to be diagnosed with fewer questions, such that diagnosis can be repeated more often and allow the dosage to be adjusted more frequently. Pharmacokinetics of the subject can be estimated based on demographic data and biomarkers or measured, in order to determine a treatment plan for the subject. Also, biomarkers can be used to determine when the patient may be at risk for experiencing undesirable side effects and the treatment plan adjusted accordingly.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for determining a timing or a dosage of an antipurinergic drug for treating a human subject having a behavioral disorder, a developmental delay, or a neurologic impairment, said method comprising: (a) receiving data for said human subject, wherein said data comprises diagnostic data for said behavioral disorder, diagnostic data for said developmental delay, diagnostic data for said neurologic impairment, demographic data of said human subject, metabolic data of said human subject, pharmacokinetic data of said human subject, clearance data of said human subject, or microbiome data of said human subject; (b) determining said timing or said dosage of said antipurinergic drug that achieves in said human subject a blood level of said antipurinergic drug of 1 μM to 100 μM, wherein said timing or said dosage is determined with a therapeutic classifier comprising a learning algorithm that uses said data that is received to determine said timing or said dosage; and (c) treating said human subject with said antipurinergic drug by providing said antipurinergic drug to said human subject at said dosage or with said timing that is determined in (b) to achieve said blood level of said antipurinergic drug.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein (c) further comprises treating said human subject with a digital therapy.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein said pharmacokinetic data of said human subject is determined in response to administering a known amount of said antipurinergic drug to said human subject at a first time and determining said blood level of said antipurinergic drug or a metabolite thereof at a second time.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein said clearance data of said human subject is determined using a beta clearance rate of said antipurinergic drug in said human subject, and wherein said beta clearance rate is estimated using said demographic data of said human subject.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein said antipurinergic drug is suramin.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving updated data for said human subject in response to said treating in (c) and generating an updated dosage or an updated timing of said antipurinergic drug for said human subject using said therapeutic classifier.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising treating said human subject with said antipurinergic drug at said updated dosage or said updated timing.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining a treatment efficacy of said treating in (c).
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising displaying a plurality of questions related to at least one of a behavior or a cognitive function of said human subject after said treating in (c), and wherein said treatment efficacy is determined at least in part from answers to said plurality of questions.
10. The method of claim 8, further comprising determining a treatment response profile of said antipurinergic drug, wherein said treatment response profile comprises said blood level of said antipurinergic drug over time, and comparing said treatment response profile with at least one target therapeutic amount of said antipurinergic drug, thereby estimating said treatment efficacy of said antipurinergic drug.
11. The method of claim 1, further comprising evaluating a behavior or a performance of said human subject using a second therapeutic classifier, wherein said second therapeutic classifier uses answers to a plurality of questions related to said behavioral disorder, said developmental delay, or said neurologic impairment.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising sending said timing or said dosage to a first digital device of said human subject individual.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising providing treatment monitoring through a second digital device of a secondary observer.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein said behavioral disorder, said developmental delay, or said neurologic impairment is selected from the group consisting of autism, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, speech and learning disability, a developmental speech delay, or a developmental language delay.
15. The method of claim 2, wherein said treating said human subject with said digital therapy comprises providing a timing or a dosage of said digital therapy.
16. The method of claim 5, further comprising receiving updated data for said human subject in response to said treating in (c) and generating an updated dosage or an updated timing of said suramin for said human subject using said therapeutic classifier.
17. The method of claim 16, further comprising treating said human subject with said suramin at said updated dosage or with said updated timing.
18. The method of claim 12, wherein said first digital device comprises a smartphone.
19. The method of claim 5, wherein said behavioral disorder, said developmental delay, or said neurologic impairment comprises autism.
