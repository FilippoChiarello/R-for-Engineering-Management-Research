<title>
Learning data generation support apparatus, operation method of learning data generation support apparatus, and learning data generation support program
</title>

<abstract>
Any one of acquired images is set as a reference image, and an image other than the reference image is set as a comparison image. According to a portion or a disease, a first image processing of extracting an anatomic region is executed with respect to the reference image, and a second image processing of extracting an anatomic region is executed with respect to the comparison image. Whether the comparison image is available as correct answer data is determined using the anatomic region of the reference image and the anatomic region of the comparison image. The comparison image determined to be available as the correct answer data is registered as the correct answer data.

<claims>
1. A learning data generation support apparatus comprising: processing circuitry configured to: acquire two or more different images obtained by imaging the same portion of a subject; set any one of the acquired images as a reference image and set an image other than the reference image among the acquired images as a comparison image, according to the portion or a disease; execute a first image processing of extracting an anatomic region with respect to the reference image according to the portion or the disease, and execute a second image processing of extracting an anatomic region with respect to the comparison image according to the portion or the disease; determine whether the comparison image is available as correct answer data using a result of whether the anatomic region of the comparison image extracted by the second image processing has an appropriate position, size, and/or range for the anatomic region of the reference image extracted by the first image processing; and register the comparison image determined to be available as the correct answer data as the correct answer data; the processing circuitry further configured to: analyze a character string in an interpretation report of each of the two or more images, and determine the reference image and the comparison image according to the portion or the disease that is obtained.
2. The learning data generation support apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry is further configured to register the comparison image and the anatomic region obtained from the comparison image as the correct answer data.
3. The learning data generation support apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the first image processing and the second image processing correspond to at least one of an organ extraction process or a lesion detection process.
4. The learning data generation support apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the kind of the first image processing is different from the kind of the second image processing.
5. The learning data generation support apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the two or more different images are images captured using two or more different kinds of imaging apparatuses.
6. The learning data generation support apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the two or more different kinds of imaging apparatuses are two or more kinds of imaging apparatuses among an MRI apparatus, a CT apparatus, a CR apparatus, a PET apparatus, and an ultrasonic imaging apparatus.
7. The learning data generation support apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the two or more different images are images captured at different imaging protocols using the same kind of imaging apparatus.
8. The learning data generation support apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the same kind of imaging apparatus is an MRI apparatus, and the different imaging protocols are a T1 imaging protocol and a T2 imaging protocol.
9. The learning data generation support apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the two or more different images are images captured at different time points using the same kind of imaging apparatus.
10. A learning data generation support apparatus comprising: processing circuitry configured to: acquire two or more different images obtained by imaging the same portion of a subject; set any one of the acquired images as a reference image and set an image other than the reference image among the acquired images as a comparison image, according to the portion or a disease; execute a first image processing of extracting an anatomic region with respect to the reference image according to the portion or the disease, and execute a second image processing of extracting an anatomic region with respect to the comparison image according to the portion or the disease; determine whether the comparison image is available as correct answer data using a result of whether the anatomic region of the comparison image extracted by the second image processing has an appropriate position, size, and/or range for the anatomic region of the reference image extracted by the first image processing; and register the comparison image determined to be available as the correct answer data as the correct answer data, wherein the processing circuitry is further configured to: register the comparison image and the anatomic region obtained from the comparison image as the correct answer data; notify that the comparison image is not available in a case where it is determined that the comparison image is not available as the correct answer data; wherein the processing circuitry is further configured to: display the anatomic region of the comparison image for which it is notified that the comparison image is not available in a recognizable manner; receive an input for modifying the anatomic region of the comparison image; and register the anatomic region of the comparison image modified according to the input that is received and the comparison image as the correct answer data.
11. An operation method of a learning data generation support apparatus that includes processing circuitry, the operation method comprising: acquiring two or more different images obtained by imaging the same portion of a subject; setting any one of the acquired images as a reference image, and setting an image other than the reference image among the acquired images as a comparison image, according to the portion or a disease; executing a first image processing of extracting an anatomic region with respect to the reference image according to the portion or the disease, and executing a second image processing of extracting an anatomic region with respect to the comparison image according to the portion or the disease; determining whether the comparison image is available as correct answer data using a result of whether the anatomic region of the comparison image extracted by the second image processing has an appropriate position, size, and/or range for the anatomic region of the reference image extracted by the first image processing; and registering the comparison image determined to be available as the correct answer data as the correct answer data; the method further comprising: analyzing a character string in an interpretation report of each of the two or more images; and determining the reference image and the comparison image according to the portion or the disease that is obtained.
12. A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium storing therein a learning data generation support program for causing a computer to: acquire two or more different images obtained by imaging the same portion of a subject; set any one of the acquired images as a reference image and set an image other than the reference image among the acquired images as a comparison image, according to the portion or a disease; execute a first image processing of extracting an anatomic region with respect to the reference image according to the portion or the disease, and execute a second image processing of extracting an anatomic region with respect to the comparison image according to the portion or the disease; determine whether the comparison image is available as correct answer data using a result of whether the anatomic region of the comparison image extracted by the second image processing has an appropriate position, size, and/or range for the anatomic region of the reference image extracted by the first image processing; and register the comparison image determined to be available as the correct answer data as the correct answer data; the program further causing the computer to: analyze a character string in an interpretation report of each of the two or more images; and determine the reference image and the comparison image according to the portion or the disease that is obtained.
