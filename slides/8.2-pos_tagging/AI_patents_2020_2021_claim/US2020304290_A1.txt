<title>
DISTRIBUTED LEDGERS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE LIFECYCLE OF DATA IN AERONAUTICS
</title>

<abstract>
Computer-implemented methods and systems for managing the lifecycle of aeronautical data stored in a blockchain, include steps of receiving or sending aeronautical data, and encrypting and/or decrypting these data using a smart contract. The use of a plurality of blockchains, and the facts and rules of management of the lifecycle of the data (e.g. programmed obsolescence, time-dependent quality indicator, etc.) are described. Transactional aspects; the use of oracle services; asymmetric, homomorphic and post-quantum encryption methods; the use of chameleon hash functions, so as to manipulate at least partially redactable blockchains; and machine-learning techniques, are in particular described with respect to a number of embodiments. Software and system aspects are described.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for managing the lifecycle of aeronautical data stored in a blockchain, called the primary blockchain, comprising steps of: receiving aeronautical data from a data producer; encrypting the received data using a smart contract called the primary smart contract; and storing the encrypted data in the primary blockchain.
2. The method according to claim 1, comprising steps of: receiving a request to access aeronautical data stored in said primary blockchain from a data consumer; determining the response to the access request made by said data consumer by executing the primary smart contract; where appropriate, decrypting the data.
3. The method according to claim 1, the smart contract comprising one or more computer programs that control the management of the lifecycle of the data.
4. The method according to claim 3, said management of the lifecycle of the data being undertaken by implementing logical rules, said logical rules comprising rules relating to the production, respectively to the consumption, and/or to the encryption, respectively to the decryption of the data or to the valid use of the data.
5. The method according to claim 4, the logical rules manipulating time parameters relating to one or more data, the time parameters comprising a start date of validity and/or an end date of validity, a time interval of validity, and a quantified or binary obsolescence dependent on time and/or quality parameters.
6. The method according to claim 3, the primary smart contract comprising one or more smart contracts stored and executed in the primary blockchain.
7. The method according to claim 1, the primary smart contract being stored and executed in a secondary blockchain, independent of the primary blockchain.
8. The method according to claim 1, the encryption being an asymmetric encryption using a pair of private and public keys, the method furthermore comprising a step of deleting the private key allowing access to the data.
9. The method according to claim 3, furthermore comprising a step of deleting one or more than one datum and/or lifecycle-management rule.
10. The method according to claim 9, the step of deleting one or more than one datum being undertaken by manipulating time parameters of validity associated with said data.
11. The method according to claim 9, the deleting step being triggered depending on data internal to the primary blockchain.
12. The method according to claim 9, the deleting step being triggered depending on data received from one or more oracles or oracle services.
13. The method according to claim 1, the encryption employing quantum key distribution and/or comprising homomorphic encryption and/or post-quantum encryption.
14. The method according to claim 1, the encryption using three keys, one key of which is of persistent type, said persistent key being held by a trusted third party and the destruction thereof preventing the data encrypted using this key from being decrypted.
15. The method according to claim 1, the smart contract performing financial transactions depending on the steps of encrypting and/or decrypting the aeronautical data.
16. The method according to claim 1, a blockchain being an at least partially modifiable or redactable blockchain.
17. The method according to claim 16, a hash function used being a chameleon hash function.
18. The method according to claim 16, wherein each block of the blockchain comprises a block identifier and a block content, said identifiers being chained.
19. The method according to claim 1, furthermore comprising one or more machine-learning steps.
20. A computer-program product, said computer program containing code instructions allowing the steps of the method according to claim 1 to be carried out when said program is executed on a computer.
21. A system for managing the lifecycle of aeronautical data comprising resources for computing, storing and networking with a view to implementing the steps of the method according to claim 1.
22. The system according to claim 21, a data producer being an aircraft and a data consumer being another aircraft.
23. The system according to claim 21, furthermore comprising one or more neural networks configured for machine learning, said one or more neural networks being chosen from neural networks comprising: an artificial neural network; an acyclic artificial neural network; a recurrent neural network; a feed-forward neural network; a convolutional neural network; a generative adversarial neural network; said one or more neural networks being emulated with software and/or being physical circuits the inputs and outputs of which are controllable by a plurality of blockchains and/or by a plurality of smart contracts.
