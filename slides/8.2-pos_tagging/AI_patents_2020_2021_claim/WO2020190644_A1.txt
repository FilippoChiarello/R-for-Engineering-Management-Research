VIRTUAL REALITY AND MIXED REALITY ENHANCED ELLIPTICAL EXERCISE TRAINER
</title>

<abstract>
A system for a virtual and mixed-reality enhanced elliptical exercise trainer that allows a user to exercise while interacting with a virtual reality or mixed reality environment using whole body movements and positioning, and receiving haptic feedback associated with the user's interaction with the virtual reality or mixed reality environment, while on an elliptical exercise training machine.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A virtual reality and mixed reality enhanced elliptical exercise trainer, comprising:
an elliptical exercise trainer; and
a body joystick comprising:
at least one rigid, semi-rigid, or flexible support arm affixed to the elliptical exercise trainer, another object, or a fixed surface;
at least one attachment device affixed to the at least one support arm, and configured to be attached to a portion of a user's body;
at least one sensor attached to, or integrated into, the body joystick, and configured to detect movement of at least a portion of a user's body during use; and
at least one haptic feedback device attached to, or integrated into, the body joystick, and configured to provide sensory feedback to the user during use; and
a control system comprising at least a plurality of programming instructions stored in the memory of, and operating on at least one processor of, a computer system, wherein the plurality of programming instructions, when operating on the processor, cause the computer system to: collect input data based on position and motion of a user's body from the body joystick; transmit the body joystick input data to a virtual reality or mixed reality machine or software application;
receive data back from the virtual reality or mixed reality machine or software application based on the user's interactions within the virtual reality or mixed reality environment; and direct the operation of the at least one haptic feedback device based on the received data to indicate some interaction within the virtual reality or mixed reality environment.
2. The system of claim 1 , wherein the attachment device comprises a strap, belt, vest, waist harness, or other device wearable on the human body.
3. The system of claim 1 , wherein the haptic feedback comprises restriction of the user's movement.
4. The system of claim 1 , wherein the entire elliptical exercise trainer is mounted on a motorized, rotatable platform, which rotates the entire exercise machine in the direction indicated by the motion of all or some portion of the user's body.
5. A method for operating a virtual reality and mixed reality enhanced elliptical exercise trainer, comprising the steps of:
measuring the movement and position of a user while exercising using a body joystick attached to the user's body;
transmitting the body joystick movement and position data to a virtual reality or mixed reality machine or software application;
receiving data back from the virtual reality or mixed reality machine or software application based on the user's interactions within the virtual reality or mixed reality environment; and directing the operation of the at least one haptic feedback device based on the received data to indicate some interaction within the virtual reality or mixed reality environment.
6. The method of claim 5, comprising the additional step of attaching the joystick to the user's body using a strap, belt, vest, waist harness, or other device wearable on the human body.
7. The method of claim 5, comprising the additional step of using haptic feedback to restrict the user's movement.
8. The system of claim 5, comprising the additional step of:
mounting the entire elliptical exercise trainer on a motorized, rotatable platform which rotates the entire exercise machine in the direction indicated by the motion of all or some portion of the user's body.
