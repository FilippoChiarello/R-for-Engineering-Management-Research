SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR UPDATING VEHICLE OPERATION BASED ON REMOTE INTERVENTION
</title>

<abstract>
Technologies disclosed relate to a remote intervention system for the operation of a vehicle, which can be an autonomous vehicle, a vehicle that includes driver assist features, a vehicle used for ride sharing services or the like. The system includes a vehicle sending a request for remote intervention to a remote operator when the operation of the vehicle is suspended. The request for remote intervention can include a request for object identification or a request for decision confirmation. The vehicle can update vehicle operation based in part on vehicle-based sensor data and a response to the remote intervention request from the remote operator. The remote operator can be a human operator or an AI operator.

<claims>
1. A vehicle configured to update vehicle operation in response to remote intervention, the vehicle comprising: an onboard hardware processor; at least one sensor in electronic communication with the onboard hardware processor, the at least one sensor configured to detect visual data about a road on which the vehicle is traveling and transmitting, on a regular basis, the visual data to the onboard hardware processor; a wireless transmitter; and a wireless receiver, wherein the onboard hardware processor is configured to: transmit a request for decision-making assistance to a remote server via the wireless transmitter in response to an operation of the vehicle being suspended, transmit the visual data to the remote server, receive a decision-making assistance response from the remote server in response to the request via the wireless receiver, and output a control signal to update the operation of the vehicle based on an aggregated information comprising the response and the visual data transmitted on the regular basis from the at least one sensor.
2. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the decision-making assistance response comprises an object classification response or a decision confirmation response.
3. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the visual data comprises three-dimensional image data.
4. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the object classification request comprises a request to identify an unknown object.
5. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the decision confirmation request comprises a request to authorize moving to an adjacent lane separated from a current lane by a solid line.
6. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the decision confirmation request comprises a request to confirm whether it is safe to continue traveling in current lane.
7. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the decision confirmation request comprises a request to confirm presence of a missing marker object.
8. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the vehicle is an autonomous driving vehicle.
9. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the at least one sensor comprises LiDAR, camera, infrared camera, ultrasonic transducer, Radar, or a combination thereof.
10. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the response from the remote server is provided by an artificial intelligence (AI) operator based on a prior response provided by a human operator.
11. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the vehicle moves to an adjacent free lane or in its current lane in response to the control signal.
12. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the vehicles remains stopped in response to the control signal.
13. A method of updating vehicle operation in response to remote intervention, the method comprising: using an onboard hardware processor of the vehicle: receiving, on a regular basis, signal inputs from at least one sensor of the vehicle in electronic communication with the onboard hardware processor, the at least one sensor configured to detect visual data about a road on which the vehicle is traveling; outputting a request for decision-making assistance to a remote server via a wireless transmitter in response to an operation of the vehicle being suspended; transmitting the visual data to the remote server; receiving a decision-making assistance response from the remote server in response to the request via a wireless receiver; and outputting a control signal to update the operation of the vehicle based on an aggregated information comprising the response and the visual data transmitted on the regular basis from the at least one sensor.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the decision-making assistance response comprising an object classification response or a decision confirmation response.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein the visual data comprises three-dimensional image data.
16. The method of claim 13, wherein the object classification request comprises a request to identify an unknown object.
17. The method of claim 13, wherein the decision confirmation request comprises a request to authorize moving to an adjacent lane separated from a current lane by a solid line.
18. The method of claim 13, wherein the decision confirmation request comprises a request to confirm whether it is safe to continue traveling in current lane.
19. The method of claim 13, wherein the decision confirmation request comprises a request to confirm the presence of a missing marker object.
20. The method of claim 13, wherein the vehicle is an autonomous driving vehicle.
21. The method of claim 13, wherein the at least one sensor comprises LiDAR, camera, infrared camera, ultrasonic transducer, Radar, or a combination thereof.
22. The method of claim 13, wherein the response from the remote server is provided by an artificial intelligence (AI) operator based on a prior response provided by a human operator.
23. The method of claim 13, wherein the vehicle moves to an adjacent free lane or in its current lane in response to the control signal.
24. The method of claim 13, wherein the vehicles remains stopped in response to the control signal.
