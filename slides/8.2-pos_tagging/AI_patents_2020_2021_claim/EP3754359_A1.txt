<title>
METHOD OF DETERMINATION OF ALIGNMENT ANGLES OF RADAR SENSORS FOR A ROAD VEHICLE RADAR AUTO-ALIGNMENT CONTROLLER
</title>

<abstract>
A method of determination of the alignment angles of two or more road vehicle (1) borne radar sensors (4) for a road vehicle radar auto-alignment controller (3) starting from initially available rough estimates of alignment angles. From at least two radar sensors (4) are obtained signals related to range, azimuth and range rate to detections. The detections are screened (5) to determine detections from stationary targets. From the determined detections from stationary targets is derived a linearized signal processing model involving alignment angles, longitudinal and lateral velocity and yaw-rate of the road vehicle (1). A filter algorithm is applied to estimate the alignment angles. Based on the estimated alignment angles are produced signals suitable for causing a road vehicle (1) radar auto-alignment controller (3) to perform radar offset compensation.
