</title>

<abstract>
In one embodiment, an apparatus comprises a storage device and a processor. The storage device may store a plurality of compressed images comprising one or more compressed master images and one or more compressed slave images. The processor may: identify an uncompressed image; access context information associated with the uncompressed image and the one or more compressed master images; determine, based on the context information, whether the uncompressed image is associated with a corresponding master image; upon a determination that the uncompressed image is associated with the corresponding master image, compress the uncompressed image into a corresponding compressed image with reference to the corresponding master image; upon a determination that the uncompressed image is not associated with the corresponding master image, compress the uncompressed image into the corresponding compressed image without reference to the one or more compressed master images; and store the corresponding compressed image on the storage device.
