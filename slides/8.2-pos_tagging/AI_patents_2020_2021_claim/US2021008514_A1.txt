PROVIDING BLENDED CONSUMER GOODS
</title>

<abstract>
A method for providing blended consumer goods to a user by using a blending device (BD) that is adapted to store at least two starting goods blendable into a blended consumer good comprises: recording (REC) selection data concerning selections of the blended consumer goods by the user; recording response data provided by the user concerning responses to the selected blended consumer goods; and processing (COD1-COD5, PP, DA) the data to prioritize presentation (SP, AUI) of blended consumer goods on a user interface (BD, UCD) for selection by the user. A data processing device (DPD, BD, UCD) comprises a data processing unit and a data storage (DB) for storing the recorded data and/or the processed data, wherein the data processing device is adapted to perform the method. A system comprises the data processing device and at least one blending device. The invention is particularly useful for blending fragrances, food, or beverages.

<claims>
1. A method for providing blended consumer goods to a user by using a blending device (BD) that is adapted to store at least two starting goods blendable into a blended consumer good, comprising: recording (REC) selection data concerning selections of the blended consumer goods by the user; recording (REC) response data provided by the user concerning responses to the selected blended consumer goods; and processing (COD1-COD5, PP, DA) the data to prioritize presentation (SP, AUI) of blended consumer goods on a user interface (BD, UCD) for selection by the user.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the blended consumer goods are blended from the same types of consumer goods, including fragrances, food or beverages.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the selection data comprise data concerning at least three out of the group comprising: ingredients of the selected blended consumer goods; pre-mixed ingredient mixes of the selected blended consumer goods; blending data used for blending the selected blended consumer goods; personal background data attached to the selected blended consumer goods.
4. The method according to claim 3, wherein the data concerning the ingredients, the pre-mixed ingredient mixes and/or the blending data are received from at least one blending device (BD) adapted to dispense the blended consumer goods based on selections of ingredients and/or pre-mixed ingredient mixes made by the user.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the selection data are processed into predictor variables for statistical analysis (DA); and the response data are processed into predicted variables for (DA) statistical analysis.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the selection data are grouped into matrices and the response data are grouped into vectors.
7. The method according to claim 5, wherein the statistical analysis (DA) is performed as a statistical learning algorithm based on the predictor variables and/or the predicted variables; and the presentation of blended consumer goods on the user interface (BD, UCD) is changed based on an outcome of the statistical learning algorithm.
8. The method according to claim 1, wherein selection data and/or response data of other users are processed to prioritize presentation of blended consumer goods on a user interface (BD, UCD) for selection by the user.
9. A data processing device (DPD, BD, UCD) comprising a data processing unit and a data storage (DB) for storing the selection data, the response data and/or the processed data, wherein the data processing device (DPD, BD, UCD) is adapted to perform the method according to claim 1.
10. A system (DPD, BD, UCD), comprising: the data processing device (DBD, BD, UCD), comprising a data processing unit and a data storage (DB) for storing the selection data, the response data and/or the processed data, wherein the data processing device (DPD, BD, UCD) is adapted to perform the method according to claim 4, and at least one blending device (BD) adapted to dispense the blended consumer goods based on selections of ingredients and/or pre-mixed ingredient mixes made by the user, wherein the data processing device (DPD, BD, UCD) and the at least one blending device (BD) are communicatively coupled such that the data concerning the ingredients, the pre-mixed ingredient mixes and/or the blending data are receivable from the at least one blending device; the data processing device (DPD, BD, UCD) is communicatively coupled to a network to receive the response data.
11. The system (DPD, BD, UCD) according to claim 10, wherein the data processing device is adapted to transfer personalized information regarding presentation of blended consumer goods to the user interface (BD, UCD) of a respective user.
