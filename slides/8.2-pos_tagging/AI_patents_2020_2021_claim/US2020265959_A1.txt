METHOD FOR DETERMINING DISEASE SYMPTOM RELATIONS USING ACCEPTANCE AND REJECTION OF RANDOM SAMPLES
</title>

<abstract>
A method and apparatus are provided that includes iteratively sampling candidates from medical records and evaluating whether ones of the candidates better explain a member from the medical records. The iterations replace the member with the candidates and depending on whether the candidates better explain the member from the medical records may be weighted in a next iteration.
