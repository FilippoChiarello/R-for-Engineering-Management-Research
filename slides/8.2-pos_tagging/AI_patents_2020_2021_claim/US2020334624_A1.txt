<title>
Computer-implemented adaptive subscription models for consumer packaged goods
</title>

<abstract>
A database comprises user information records for users subscribing to one or more goods through a subscription service. In some aspects a user record may contain information about the user, one or more households of the user and the constituents of those households, and other information about the user, households, and/or constituents of household. User records are updated based on various signals corresponding to user feedback and amounts of provided goods and utilized in iterative training of consumption models by which consumption of different goods is determined based on household properties. The consumption model outputs a predicted consumption of goods for a household and amounts of goods are translated into one or more SKUs for fulfillment by the subscription service.
