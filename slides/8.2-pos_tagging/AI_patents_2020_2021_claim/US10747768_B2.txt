<title>
Data processing system and data processing method
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a data processing system. A storing unit stores ontology data. A selection unit selects a data stream including key information corresponding to a query using the ontology data stored in the storing unit, among data streams including key information uniquely given to sensor data. A processing unit processes the selected data stream.

<claims>
1. A data processing system comprising: a storage device storing work procedure ontology data generated from a work procedure manual subjected to natural language processing, a series of assembly operation elements being connected in an order of the work procedure manual; and a processor configured to: partition first sensor data into data pieces; associate each data piece of the partitioned first sensor data with each assembly operation element of the series of assembly operation elements; determine a set of learning data by performing machine learning using the partitioned first sensor data as a teacher data set; calculate a degree of similarity between the learning data and each assembly operation element of the series of assembly operation elements; compare second sensor data sequentially obtained from a sensor installed in an assembly process with the learning data to extract an assembly operation element with a highest degree of similarity from the series of assembly operation elements; reconfigure the extracted assembly operation element with the highest degree of similarity as first sequence information; reconfigure the work procedure ontology data into second sequence information; compare the first sequence information with the second sequence information; and in response to the extracted assembly operation element reconfigured as the first sequence information being different from an assembly operation element in the second sequence information, output a result indicating a failure.
2. The data processing system according to claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: determine the assembly operation element of the series of assembly operation elements using the work procedure ontology data; and extract second sensor data corresponding to the determined assembly operation element.
3. The data processing system according to claim 1, wherein: the storage device is configured to store a data processing routine template associated with the work procedure ontology data, and the processor is configured to select a data stream and process the selected data stream abased on the data processing routine template.
4. The data processing system according to claim 1, wherein: time information is included in data obtained by cutting out the second sensor data into a time window having a predetermined time period, and the processor is configured to use the first sequence information and the second sequence information to detect a failure of a product assembly time.
5. A data processing method comprising: storing work procedure ontology data generated from a work procedure manual subjected to natural language processing, a series of assembly operation elements being connected in an order of the work procedure manual; partitioning first sensor data into data pieces associating each data piece of the partitioned first sensor data with each assembly operation element of the series of assembly operation elements; determining a set of learning data by performing machine learning using the partitioned first sensor data as a teacher data set; calculating a degree of similarity between the learning data and each assembly operation element of the series of assembly operation elements; comparing second sensor data sequentially obtained from a sensor installed in an assembly process with the learning data to extract an assembly operation element with a highest degree of similarity from the series of assembly operation elements; reconfiguring the extracted assembly operation element with the highest degree of similarity as first sequence information; reconfiguring the work procedure ontology data into second sequence information; comparing the first sequence information with the second sequence information; and in response to the extracted assembly operation element reconfigured as the first sequence information being different from an assembly operation element in the second sequence information, outputting a result indicating a failure.
