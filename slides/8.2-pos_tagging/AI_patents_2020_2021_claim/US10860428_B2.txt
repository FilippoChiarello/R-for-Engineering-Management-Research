<title>
Apparatus, system, and method for increasing the longevity of archival tape
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method for increasing the longevity of archival tape may include suspending, by a scheduling computing system, an initiation of a read/write process for an archival tape. The method may also include reading a tape status stored on a status tag embedded on a cartridge of the archival tape. In addition, the method may include deducing, by the scheduling computing system, a health status of the archival tape from the tape status. Furthermore, the method may include adjusting, by the scheduling computing system, a read/write policy of the archival tape based on the health status. Finally, the method may include completing the read/write process of the archival tape based on the adjusted read/write policy. Various other methods, systems, and computer-readable media are also disclosed.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: suspending, by a scheduling computing system, an initiation of a read/write process for an archival tape; reading a tape status stored on a status tag embedded on a cartridge of the archival tape, wherein the status tag is embedded on the cartridge such that a status-tag reader, within a proximity of the cartridge, is capable of reading the tape status stored on the status tag for use by the scheduling computing system; deducing, by the scheduling computing system, a health status of the archival tape from the tape status; adjusting, by the scheduling computing system, a read/write policy of the archival tape based on the health status; and completing the read/write process of the archival tape based on the adjusted read/write policy.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the read/write process comprises at least one of: reading data from the archival tape; writing data to the archival tape; spooling the archival tape; unspooling the archival tape; reading a wrap of the archival tape; performing a full verification of the archival tape; performing a compaction process from the archival tape to a new archival tape; or performing a background scan of the archival tape.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the tape status comprises at least one of: a time of a last full verification of the archival tape; a time of a last wrap read of the archival tape; or a percent of a last known media error rate of the archival tape.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein deducing the health status of the archival tape comprises at least one of: determining a data integrity of the archival tape based on the tape status; predicting tape deterioration based on the time of the last wrap read; or estimating a durability score of data on the archival tape based on the time of the last wrap read and the last known media error rate.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein adjusting the read/write policy comprises at least one of: rescheduling the read/write process; changing a frequency of the read/write process; revising the read/write process; canceling the read/write process; or adjusting a different read/write process.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising updating the tape status stored on the status tag of the archival tape based on the completed read/write process.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising at least one of: alerting an administrator of a failure of the archival tape; or improving a predictive analysis method used to predict a future health status of the archival tape.
8. An archival-tape unit comprising: an archival tape that is configured to store archival data; a cartridge dimensioned to house the archival tape; and a status tag, embedded on the cartridge such that a status-tag reader, within a proximity of the cartridge, is capable of reading a tape status stored on the status tag, that is configured to store status data about the archival tape that facilitates procedures by a scheduling computing system to: deduce a health status of the archival tape from the tape status; adjust a read/write policy of the archival tape based on the health status; and command completion of a read/write process of the archival tape based on the adjusted read/write policy.
9. The archival-tape unit of claim 8, wherein the archival tape comprises a magnetic tape medium capable of storing digital data for sequential access.
10. The archival-tape unit of claim 8, wherein the cartridge comprises: at least one reel dimensioned to fit a width of the archival tape for wrapping; and an enclosure dimensioned to encompass the reel and the wrapped archival tape such that a portion of the archival tape is exposed for read/write processes.
11. The archival-tape unit of claim 8, wherein the status tag is embedded on the cartridge such that a status-tag writer, within a proximity of the cartridge, is capable of updating the tape status stored on the status tag.
12. A tape-archival system comprising: at least one archival-tape unit that comprises: an archival tape configured to store archival data; a cartridge dimensioned to house the archival tape; and a status tag, embedded on the cartridge such that a status-tag reader, within a proximity of the cartridge, is capable of reading a tape status stored on the status tag, that is configured to store status data about the archival tape; at least one status-tag reader that reads the tape status stored on the status tag embedded on the archival-tape unit; and a scheduling computing system that: suspends an initiation of a read/write process for the archival tape; deduces a health status of the archival tape from the tape status; adjusts a read/write policy of the archival tape based on the health status; and commands completion of the read/write process of the archival tape based on the adjusted read/write policy.
13. The tape-archival system of claim 12, wherein the scheduling computing system is electronically coupled to the status-tag reader such that the scheduling computing system: commands the status-tag reader to read the status tag embedded on the archival-tape unit; and receives a tape status of the archival tape from the status-tag reader.
14. The tape-archival system of claim 12, wherein the archival-tape unit is stored in a vertical storage stack, dimensioned to store a plurality of archival tapes in a plurality of horizontal slots, such that a face of the vertical storage stack exposes the status tag embedded on the archival-tape unit to the status-tag reader.
15. The tape-archival system of claim 14, wherein the scheduling computing system commands completion of the read/write process of the archival tape by at least one of: commanding at least one tape-handling apparatus to relocate at least one archival-tape unit: from a slot of the vertical storage stack to a tape drive; or from the tape drive to the slot of the vertical storage stack; or commanding the tape drive to complete the read/write process of the archival tape.
16. The tape-archival system of claim 15, wherein the tape-handling apparatus comprises a robotic arm dimensioned to: hold the archival-tape unit; extract the archival-tape unit from the vertical storage stack; extract the archival-tape unit from the tape drive; insert the archival-tape unit into the vertical storage stack; and insert the archival-tape unit into the tape drive.
17. The tape-archival system of claim 15, wherein the scheduling computing system is electronically coupled to the tape drive such that the scheduling computing system: sends commands to the tape drive; and/or receives data from the tape drive.
18. The tape-archival system of claim 15, wherein the tape drive is dimensioned to: hold the archival-tape unit; and complete the read/write process by facilitating at least one of: reading data from the archival tape; writing data to the archival tape; spooling the archival tape; unspooling the archival tape; reading a wrap of the archival tape; performing a full verification of the archival tape; performing a compaction process from the archival tape to a new archival tape held by another tape drive; or performing a background scan of the archival tape.
19. The tape-archival system of claim 12, wherein the scheduling computing system is electronically coupled to a status-tag writer such that the scheduling computing system commands the status-tag writer to update the tape status stored on the status tag of the archival tape based on the completed read/write process.
