<title>
Integration of item variations for display in user interfaces
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for generating and presenting user interfaces that provide a consolidated representation for same or similar products available for acquisition with variations of product attributes is described. A primary user interface (UI) for presenting a product having a product attribute may be presented via a device. The primary UI may present a representation of the product with an indication that alternate product(s) are available with alternate product attributes. Based on receiving a request to access information about the alternate product(s), a secondary UI may be generated for presenting the information about the alternate product(s). The secondary UI, which may overlay a portion of the primary UI, may be presented via the device. Based on receiving an indication of a selection of an alternate product, the presentation of the secondary UI may be terminated and the primary UI may be updated to reflect the selection of the alternate product.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: receiving, from a service provider, data associated with offers for a plurality of products that are available for acquisition via an online marketplace provided by the service provider, the plurality of products being a same type of product; aggregating product attributes associated with the offers to generate aggregated product attributes; determining a representative offer of the offers, the representative offer corresponding to a first product of the plurality of products, the first product having a first product attribute of the aggregated product attributes; determining, based at least in part on the aggregated product attributes, that second products of the plurality of products are available with alternate product attributes of the aggregated product attributes; generating a primary user interface to present the representative offer, the primary user interface presenting a first graphical representation of the first product having the first product attribute and a first control indicating that the second products are available with alternate product attributes; presenting the primary user interface via a display of a device of a user; determining an actuation of the first control; generating a secondary user interface for presenting a number of offers corresponding to the second products, individual second products of the second products having different alternate product attributes; presenting the secondary user interface via the display of the device, the secondary user interface overlaying at least a portion of the primary user interface and including a second control for closing the secondary user interface; based at least in part on presenting the secondary user interface via the display of the device, causing an effect to be applied to the primary user interface to deemphasize the primary user interface and indicate that the primary user interface is not active; determining a selection of an offer of the number of offers corresponding to a second product of the second products, the second product having an alternate product attribute of the alternate product attributes; updating the primary user interface by replacing the first graphical representation with a second graphical representation of the second product; determining an actuation of the second control; terminating the presentation of the secondary user interface via the display of the device; and restoring the primary user interface to an original presentation, the primary user interface presenting the second graphical representation instead of the first graphical representation via the original presentation.
2. A computer-implemented method as claim 1 recites, wherein the secondary user interface includes swatches respectively corresponding to each offer of the number of offers, a swatch of the swatches associated with the offer including: the second graphical representation of the second product; and additional information associated with the offer, the additional information including at least one of a price associated with the offer, shipping options associated with the offer, payment terms associated with the offer, delivery options associated with the offer, or alternate product attributes associated with the second product.
3. A computer-implemented method as claim 2 recites, further comprising: accessing, from a user profile associated with the user, data representative of previous interactions between the user and the service provider; determining, based at least in part on the data representative of the previous interactions between the user and the service provider, preferences of the user concerning information presented in swatches; and determining the additional information associated with the offer based at least in part on the preferences of the user.
4. A computer-implemented method as claim 1 recites, further comprising: determining a size of the display of the device; and determining the number of offers based at least in part on the size of the display.
5. A computer-implemented method comprising: generating a primary user interface for presenting a product available for acquisition from a seller, the product having a product attribute and the primary user interface presenting the product and including an indication that one or more alternate products are available with alternate product attributes; presenting the primary user interface via a display of a device associated with a user; determining a request to access information about the one or more alternate products; generating a secondary user interface for presenting the information about the one or more alternate products; causing the secondary user interface to be presented via the display of the device, the secondary user interface overlaying a portion of the primary user interface; applying an effect to the primary user interface to deemphasize the primary user interface and indicate that the primary user interface is inactive; updating the primary user interface during display of the secondary user interface based at least in part on user interactions with the secondary user interface; terminating presentation of the secondary user interface via the display of the device; and restoring the primary user interface to an original presentation that includes a graphical representation based at least in part on the user interactions with the secondary user interface.
6. A computer-implemented method as claim 5 recites, further comprising causing the secondary user interface to overlay a bottom portion of the primary user interface.
7. A computer-implemented method as claim 5 recites, wherein: the primary user interface further includes a graphical representation of the product; and the method further comprises causing the secondary user interface to be positioned without obstructing the graphical representation.
8. A computer-implemented method as claim 5 recites, wherein the effect comprises at least one of an application of a layer having a degree of opaqueness to deemphasize the primary user interface, a reduction of a size of representations presented via the primary user interface, or a reduction of a brightness of the primary user interface.
9. A computer-implemented method as claim 5 recites, wherein: the primary user interface further includes a graphical representation of the product; and the method further comprises causing, based at least in part on receiving the indication, the graphical representation of the product to be replaced by another graphical representation of the alternate product having the alternate product attribute.
10. A computer-implemented method as claim 5 recites, wherein generating the secondary user interface comprises: accessing a representative item for the alternate product; generating a swatch based at least in part on the representative item; and generating the secondary user interface based at least in part on arranging the swatch with additional swatches respectively associated with other alternate products of the one or more alternate products.
11. A computer-implemented method as claim 10 recites, wherein the representative item comprises a text representation or a graphical representation.
12. A computer-implemented method as claim 10 recites, further comprising determining dimensions of the swatch based at least in part on the representative item.
13. A computer-implemented method as claim 10 recites, further comprising: accessing additional information associated with the alternate product; determining at least a portion of the additional information to present with the swatch; and generating the swatch based at least in part on at least the portion of the additional information.
14. A computer-implemented method as claim 13 recites, further comprising determining a configuration of the swatch based at least in part on at least the portion of the additional information.
15. A computer-implemented method as claim 10 recites, further comprising arranging at least a portion of the swatch and the additional swatches in a linear arrangement in the secondary user interface to enable browsing through the swatch and the additional swatches.
