<title>
Acousto-optic Driver and Acousto-optic Device
</title>

<abstract>
The Invention discloses an acousto-optic driver which has a controller with a Bluetooth communication module, which the controller outputs a first control instruction controlling a luminous mode of an LED lamp bank, the controller further parses an audio signal received by the bluetooth communication module and then outputs a second control instruction, the controller, when parsing the audio signal, acquires a frequency spectrum of the audio signal, and the first control instruction output by the controller adapts a flashing state of the LED lamp bank to a frequency spectrum of played music; an inverter circuit, electrically connected with the controller, the inverter circuit being switched on or switched off according to the first control instruction output by the controller; and an audio power amplifier, electrically connected with the controller, the audio power amplifier amplifying the second control instruction output by the controller.

<claims>
We claim:
1. An acousto-optic driver, characterized by comprising: a controller with a Bluetooth communication module, wherein the controller outputs a first control instruction controlling a luminous mode of a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) lamp bank, the controller further parses an audio signal received by the Bluetooth communication module and then outputs a second control instruction, the controller, when parsing the audio signal, acquires a frequency spectrum of the audio signal, and the first control instruction output by the controller adapts a flashing state of the LED lamp bank to a frequency spectrum of played music; an inverter circuit electrically connected with the controller, the inverter circuit being switched on or switched off according to the first control instruction output by the controller; and an audio power amplifier electrically connected with the controller, the audio power amplifier amplifying the second control instruction output by the controller.
2. The acousto-optic driver according to claim 1, wherein the controller is at least provided with a first audio output end and a second audio output end, and the acousto-optic driver further comprises: a first resistor, one end of the first resistor being connected with the first audio output end and the other end of the first resistor being connected with an input end of the audio power amplifier; and a second resistor, one end of the second resistor being connected with the second audio output end and the other end of the second resistor being connected with the input end of the audio power amplifier.
3. The acousto-optic driver of claim 2, wherein the input end of the audio power amplifier comprises a first input end, the other end of the first resistor is connected with the first input end of the audio power amplifier, and the other end of the second resistor is connected with the first input end of the audio power amplifier.
4. The acousto-optic driver according to claim 2, wherein the input end of the audio power amplifier comprises the first input end and a second input end, the other end of the first resistor is connected with the first input end of the audio power amplifier, and the other end of the second resistor is connected with the second input end of the audio power amplifier.
5. The acousto-optic driver according to claim 1, wherein the audio power amplifier comprises an audio power amplifier body; and a capacitor, one end of the capacitor being electrically connected with the audio power amplifier body and the other end of the capacitor being the input end of the audio power amplifier.
6. An acousto-optic device, characterized by comprising the acousto-optic driver according to claim 1 and further comprising: a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) lamp bank connected to an output end of an inverter circuit; and a speaker connected to an output end of an audio power amplifier.
