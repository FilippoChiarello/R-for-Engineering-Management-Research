USER INTERFACE FOR DETERMINING REAL-TIME CHANGES TO CONTENT ENTERED INTO THE USER INTERFACE TO PROVIDE TO A CLASSIFIER PROGRAM AND RULES ENGINE TO GENERATE RESULTS FOR THE CONTENT
</title>

<abstract>
Provided are a computer program product, system, and method for determining real-time changes to content entered into a user interface to generate results for the content. In response to determining that entry of first content in a user input field rendered in a user interface is completed, the first content is provided to a classification program to classify into a first machine classification to provide to a rules engine to determine a first machine determined proposition. The first machine determined proposition is rendered in the user interface. A determination is made of second content in the user input field from the user that differs from the first content. The second content is provided to the classification program to classify into a second machine classification to provide to the rules engine to determine a second machine determined proposition rendered in the user interface with the second content.
