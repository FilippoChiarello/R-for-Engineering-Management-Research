<title>
PRIVACY SEPARATED CREDIT SCORING MECHANISM
</title>

<abstract>
Banking and telecommunication network data may be combined to generate credit scores by separating aspects of credit score computation to protect the privacy of consumers and each institution that may collect data. A system of unsupervised, semi-supervised, or adaptive learning may be separated between a bank and a telecommunications network.Telecommunications networks may generate summarized statistics of their users, which maybe combined into a formula for calculating an estimated credit score. The factors used for the formula may be transmitted to the bank, which may compare the calculated scores with actual financial behavior. The bank may generate updated factors, which may be returned to the telecommunications network to update the credit scoring formula.

Privacy Separated Credit Scoring Mechanism
1. A system comprising:
at least one computer processor;
said at least one computer processor configured to perform a method comprising:
receiving a first list of phone identifiers;
for each of said phone identifiers in said first list, obtaining a first vector of calculated statistics being derived from telecommunications network observations;
obtaining a second vector of weighting factors;
for each of said phone identifiers, determining a calculated credit score by taking a dot
product of said first vector and said second vector;
for each of said phone identifiers, determining an observed credit score by analyzing financial behavior;
for each of said weighting factors, computing an updated weighting factor by comparing said calculated credit scores and said observed credit scores for each of said phone identifiers; and
storing said updated weighting factors in an updated vector of weighting factors.
2. The system of claim 1 , said method further comprising:
receiving a third vector comprising calculated statistics associated with a first phone identifier, said first phone identifier not having said financial behavior;
calculating a first credit score associated with said first phone identifier by taking a dot product of said third vector and said updated vector of weighting factors.
3. The system of claim 2,
said first vector of calculated statistics being obtained from a second system;
said method further comprising:
transmitting said updated vector of weighting factors to said second system.
4. The system of claim 3, said method further comprising:
sending a request for customers having a predefined range of credit scores to said second system; and
receiving a set of identifiers associated with individuals having said predefined range of credit scores.
5. The system of claim 3, said method further comprising:
sending a request for customers having a predefined range of credit scores to said second system, said second system obtaining a set of customers having said predefined range of credit scores and transmitting said set of customers to a third system, said third system being configured to contact a subset of said set of customers.
6. The system of claim 5, said third system having obtained consent from said subset of said set of
customers.
7. The system of claim 1 , said computing said updated weighting factors being performed at least in part by regression.
8. The system of claim 1 , said first vector of calculated statistics comprising movement observation
statistics.
9. The system of claim 8, said movement observation statistics comprising a radius of gyration.
10. The system of claim 8, said first vector of calculated statistics comprising telephone communication behavior.
11. The system of claim 10, said first vector of calculated statistics comprising mobile device data
consumption behavior.
12. A method performed by at least one computer processor, said method comprising:
receiving a first list of phone identifiers;
for each of said phone identifiers in said first list, obtaining a first vector of calculated statistics being derived from telecommunications network observations;
obtaining a second vector of weighting factors;
for each of said phone identifiers, determining a calculated credit score by taking a dot product of said first vector and said second vector;
for each of said phone identifiers, determining an observed credit score by analyzing financial behavior;
for each of said weighting factors, computing an updated weighting factor by comparing said
calculated credit scores and said observed credit scores for each of said phone identifiers; and
storing said updated weighting factors in an updated vector of weighting factors.
13. The method of claim 12 further comprising: receiving a third vector comprising calculated statistics associated with a first phone identifier, said first phone identifier not having said financial behavior;
calculating a first credit score associated with said first phone identifier by taking a dot product of said third vector and said updated vector of weighting factors.
14. The method of claim 13,
said first vector of calculated statistics being obtained from a second system;
said method further comprising:
transmitting said updated vector of weighting factors to said second system.
15. The method of claim 14 further comprising:
sending a request for customers having a predefined range of credit scores to said second system; and
receiving a set of identifiers associated with individuals having said predefined range of credit scores.
16. The method of claim 14 further comprising:
sending a request for customers having a predefined range of credit scores to said second system, said second system obtaining a set of customers having said predefined range of credit scores and transmitting said set of customers to a third system, said third system being configured to contact a subset of said set of customers.
17. The method of claim 16, said third system having obtained consent from said subset of said set of customers.
18. The method of claim 12, said computing said updated weighting factors being performed at least in part by regression.
19. The method of claim 12, said first vector of calculated statistics comprising movement observation statistics.
20. The method of claim 19, said movement observation statistics comprising a radius of gyration.
21. The method of claim 19, said first vector of calculated statistics comprising telephone communication behavior.
22. The method of claim 21 , said first vector of calculated statistics comprising mobile device data
consumption behavior.
