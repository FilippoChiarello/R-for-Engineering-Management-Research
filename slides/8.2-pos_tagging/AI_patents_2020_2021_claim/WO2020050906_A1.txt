<title>
RECOMMENDATION RANKING ALGORITHMS THAT OPTIMIZE BEYOND BOOKING
</title>

<abstract>
A computer implemented method for incorporating multiple objectives in a ranked list of search results includes receiving a search query from a client device, accessing a set of stored listings for goods or services and probabilities of serving the listings, defining a serving vector as a probability distribution over the set of listings, providing a serving vector as input to a multi -objective function, decomposing the multi-objective function into one or more objective functions, generating a ranked list of the listings based at least in part on the serving vector that maximizes the decomposed multi-objective function, and providing the listings to the client device according to the order of the ranked list. Each objective function addresses a different goal in an overall diversity optimization.

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method for incorporating multiple objectives in a ranked list of search results provided for display as part of a graphical user interface on a display screen of a computing device, the method comprising:
receiving a search query from a client device;
accessing a set of stored listings for goods or services, and probabilities associated with serving the listings;
defining a serving vector as a probability distribution over the set of listings; providing the serving vector as input to a multi-objective function;
decomposing the multi-objective function into one or more objective functions, each objective function configured to address a different goal in an overall diversity optimization;
generating a ranked list of the listings based at least in part on the serving vector that maximizes the decomposed multi-objective function; and
providing the listings for display on the client device according to the order of the ranked list.
2. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the serving vector is sorted by probability in a descending order.
3. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein each of the objective functions comprises a coefficient that governs a relative importance of each objective function in the overall diversity optimization.
4. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the one or more objective functions include a first objective function that represents a total expected number of bookings given the serving vector.
5. The computer implemented method of claim 4, wherein the first objective function comprises a first probability of booking of a serving item and a second probability of serving the listing.
6. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the one or more objective functions includes a second objective function configured to boost rankings for the listings of the set with low occupancy rate while maintaining a controllable ranking regression for listings of the set with high occupancy rate.
7. The computer implemented method of claim 6, wherein the second objective function is summed with the first objective function.
8. The computer implemented method of claim 6, wherein the second objective function comprises a concave function.
9. The computer implemented method of claim 8, wherein the concave function includes a linear interpolant between a first epsilon value and a second epsilon value.
10. The computer implemented method of claim 7, wherein the concave function is a function of occupancy rate, the concave function configured to be large when occupancy rate for a listing is low and small when occupancy rate for a listing is high.
11. The computer implemented method of claim 7, wherein the concave function is a function of at least one of revenue, profit, and cost.
12. The computer implemented method of claim 2 further comprising:
generating a second ranked list based on the first ranked list;
iteratively post-processing the serving vector after the first ranked list is returned based on the sorted serving vector.
13. The computer implemented method of claim 12, wherein iteratively post-processing the serving vector after the complete ranked list is returned based on the sorted serving vector comprises:
picking a first listing from the first ranked list;
initializing a set as the null set;
appending the first listing of the first ranked list to the set where reranked items are stored;
picking a second listing out of the first ranked list subtracted by the set by
maximizing serving probability and a worst-case diversity measure between the listing to be selected and listings already selected in the set; and
appending the second item to the set and repeating the above steps.
14. The computer implemented method of claim 12, wherein the worst-case diversity measure measures at least one of content diversity and social diversity by performing a comparison between listings.
