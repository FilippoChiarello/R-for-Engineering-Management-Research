Arithmetic processing device for deep learning and control method of the arithmetic processing device for deep learning
</title>

<abstract>
A memory 11 stores therein first data and second data each of which has element data that forms a matrix. Arithmetic units 51 to 53 repeat, for each of a first predetermined row of the first data and a second predetermined row of the second data that are stored in the memory 11, by using the element data included in the first predetermined row and the element data included in the second predetermined row, a row portion operation based on the number of columns in the second data and performs, by using results of the row portion operations, an arithmetic operation process that acquires the operation results of the operation that uses the first data and the second data.

<claims>
1. A control method performed by an arithmetic processing apparatus coupled to a storage apparatus comprising: storing, in the storage apparatus, first data and second data each of which has element data that forms a matrix; performing a row portion operation by performing, by sequentially shifting a predetermined position from a top by a predetermined number at a time, an operation that arranges, in an order of an arrangement in the first data, element data included in a first predetermined row that has a predetermined number of rows, that acquires first element data that corresponds to the element data arranged from the predetermined position to a number of columns of the second data, that multiplies each of the pieces of the acquired first element data by an associated pieces of the element data included in a second predetermined row that has the predetermined number of rows, and that sums multiplication results, and performs, by using results of the row portion operations, a convolution operation that is performed by shifting, by using the second data as weight data, arrangement positions of the second data in the first data by a predetermined number at a time, and performing an image recognition by using a result of the convolution operation.
2. A control method performed by an arithmetic processing apparatus coupled to a storage apparatus comprising: storing, in the storage apparatus, first data and second data each of which has element data that forms a matrix, the second data being a difference between an output expected value and calculation data that is calculated in a convolution operation that is performed by shifting, by a predetermined number at a time, arrangement positions of weight data arranged in the first data; repeating by using a single row in the first data as a first predetermined row and using a single row in the second data as a second predetermined row, for each of the first predetermined row and the second predetermined row, by using the element data included in the first predetermined row and the element data included in the second predetermined row, a row portion operation based on the number of columns of the second data, performing an operation that calculates a difference between the weight data and a weight expected value by using the first data and the second data, and performing an image recognition by using a result of the operation.
3. A control method performed by an arithmetic processing apparatus coupled to a storage apparatus comprising: storing, in the storage apparatus, first data and second data each of which has element data that forms a matrix, the second data being a difference between an output expected value and calculation data that is calculated in a convolution operation that is performed by shifting, by a predetermined number at a time, arrangement positions of weight data arranged in the first data, the first data being a difference between an output expected value and calculation data that is calculated in a convolution operation that is performed by using the second data as weight data and by shifting arrangement positions of the second data in input data by a predetermined number at a time; repeating by using, in a specific layer in one of a plurality of layers arranged in order, a single row in the first data as the first predetermined row and by using, in a specific layer, a single row in the second data as the second predetermined row, for each of the first predetermined row and the second predetermined row, by using the element data included in the first predetermined row and the element data included in the second predetermined row, a row portion operation based on the number of columns of the second data, and that performs an operation that calculates, for each of the predetermined number by using the first data and the second data, a difference between an output expected value and output data in a layer that is immediately previous to the specific layer, and performing an image recognition by using a result of the operation.
