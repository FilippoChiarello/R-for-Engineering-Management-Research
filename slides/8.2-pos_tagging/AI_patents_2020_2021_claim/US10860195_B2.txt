<title>
Plant/project standards and display themes in a process control plant
</title>

<abstract>
Configuring graphical display views to be presented, at a user interface of an operating environment of a process plant, using multiple graphical display themes includes configuring a display theme object to indicate a plurality of themes via which the display view is able to be presented at the user interface. The display theme object includes a parameter whose value is changeable, within the operating environment, to indicate a desired theme that is to be utilized, and the display theme object is downloaded from the configuration environment into the operating environment. Thus, during runtime, changing the theme via which the graphical display view is presented is achieved without any additional downloads from or communications with the configuration environment. User controls may be provided to an operator to select different themes, and/or to override various visual aspects of themes to achieve optimum visibility. Themes may be automatically changed based on sensed conditions.
