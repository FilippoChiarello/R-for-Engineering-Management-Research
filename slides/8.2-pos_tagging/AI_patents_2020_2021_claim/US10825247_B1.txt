<title>
Presenting integrated building information using three-dimensional building models
</title>

<abstract>
Automated operations related to providing visual information of multiple types in an integrated manner about a building or other defined area may include generating and presenting a GUI (graphical user interface) on a client device that includes a computer model of the building's interior with one or more first types of information (e.g., in a first pane of the GUI), and simultaneously presenting other types of related information about the building interior (e.g., in additional separate GUI pane(s)) that is coordinated with the first type(s) of information being currently displayed. The computer model may be a 3D (three-dimensional) or 2.5D representation generated after the house is built and showing the actual house's interior (e.g., walls, furniture, etc.), and may be displayed to a user of a client computing device in a displayed GUI with various user-selectable controls.
