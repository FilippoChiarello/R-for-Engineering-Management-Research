Method for Training Parametric Machine Learning Systems
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for training a parametric machine learning system, include compressing a first data; storing the compressed first data; reconstructing a first selected amount of the stored compressed first data; providing a machine learning system; and training the machine learning system with the reconstructed first data and optionally raw data.

<claims>
1. A method for training a parametric machine learning system, comprising; compressing a first data; storing the compressed first data; reconstructing a first selected amount of the stored compressed first data; providing a machine learning system; and training the machine learning system with the reconstructed first data.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising training the machine learning system with raw data.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising training the machine learning system with data comprising reconstructions of compressed second data, raw data, or both.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising reconstructing a second selected amount of the stored compressed first data and training the machine learning system with the second selected amount of reconstructed first data.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the first selected amount of the stored compressed first data comprises all the stored compressed first data.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein data comprises images, strings, audio waves, charts, coordinates, vectors, or text.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein compressing a first data is performed by a compression model.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the compression model is a product quantization, K-means clustering, Gaussian mixture model, vector quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), or Adaptive Resonance Theory network, transform coding, wavelet compression, Huffman coding, run-length encoding, or incremental encoding.
