<title>
Device and method for detection of analytes
</title>

<abstract>
A detection device and associated systems and methods for detecting analytes from a multiplex reaction are described. In particular, a device for conducting at least one detection reaction using a modified ELISA method including a surface with a detection region and a reference region, a detection sensor, and a light source. The detection device may include a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor. The device may be used to measure and report discrete quantities or combinations of discrete analytes, providing information to aid in the prognosis and/or diagnosis of altered states of health in vertebrates.

<claims>
1. A method for the detection of one or more analytes in a subject, the method comprising: a) obtaining a biological sample from the subject and b) contacting a device with the sample, the device comprising; i. a surface to conduct at least one detection reaction, the surface comprising: a detection region comprising one or more epitope binding agents, wherein each epitope binding agent is configured to bind exclusively to one of the at least one analytes; and a reference region; ii. one or more detection sensors to sense light associated with the detection region; iii. one or more reference sensors to sense light associated with the reference region; and wherein the one or more detection sensors and the one or more reference sensors are operated using a balanced sensor method; and c) detecting with the device the level of the one or more analytes.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more epitope binding agents are selected from the group consisting of apatmers, double stranded DNA sequence, ligands, fragments of ligands, receptors, fragments of receptors, antibodies, fragments of antibodies, coenzymes, coregulators, allosteric molecules, ions and combinations thereof.
3. The method of claim 1, the method further comprising; d) comparing the level of said one or more analytes as determined in step c) with a reference level from a biological sample of a healthy control individual.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the biological sample is selected from the group consisting of cerebral spinal fluid, blood, urine, saliva, and tears.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the device further comprising at least one light source to illuminate the detection region and the reference region, wherein the at least one light source is ambient light.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more epitope binding agents are specific for at least four biomarkers selected from a combination CCL3, CCL5, CCL18, Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (HFABP), Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PaPPa), hsCRP, cardiac Troponin I (hs cTnl), Placental growth factor (PIGF), brain natriuretic peptide (Nt-proBNP), Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC-1), cystatin C, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (LP PLA2).
7. The method of claim 6, the method further comprising: d) detecting with the device whether the level of an analyte was in the positive range indicated in Table A; and e) identifying the subject as at risk for future cardiac failure when one or more of the analytes in the biological sample are in the positive range.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the subject is complaining of discomfort that may indicate cardiac failure.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the cardiac failure is selected from the group consisting of an acute coronary syndrome and a myocardial infarction.
10. The method of claim 7, wherein the cardiac failure is a myocardial infarction.
11. The method of claim 7, wherein the cardiac failure is a cardiac failure that occurs within 2 weeks after the level of biomarkers was determined.
12. The method of claim 7, wherein the cardiac failure is a cardiac failure that occurs 72 hours to 2 weeks after the level of biomarkers was determined.
13. The method of claim 7, wherein the cardiac failure may comprise a fatal or nearly fatal cardiac failure.
14. The method of claims 6, the method further comprising: c) comparing the level of said biomarkers as determined in step b) with a reference level from a biological sample of a healthy control individual; d) determining whether the level of said biomarkers as determined in step b) are significantly different from said reference level in step b); and e) conducting normal diagnostic tests on the subject; wherein, a significant difference as determined in step d) in the level of biomarkers, and negative normal diagnostic test results, indicate the cardiac failure is an imminent cardiac failure.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the normal diagnostic tests are selected from the group consisting of conducting an electrocardiogram, an X-ray of the chest, a cardiac stress test, an echocardiography, a scintigraphy, a cardiac index, and determining the level of additional biomarkers.
16. The method of claim 14, wherein the normal diagnostic test is an electrocardiogram or an electrocardiogram and level of troponin.
