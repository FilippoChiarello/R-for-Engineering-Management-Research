METHOD AND DEVICE FOR LOCALIZING A SENSOR IN A VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
A method for localizing a sensor in a vehicle comprises: capturing, by means of a first sensor being mounted on a vehicle, at least one image of a moveable element of the vehicle, the moveable element having a predetermined spatial relationship to a second sensor being mounted on the vehicle, the moveable element being moveable relative to the first sensor; determining a spatial information on the moveable element on the basis of the at least one image; and localizing the second sensor on the basis of the spatial information by means of a transformation rule, the transformation rule representing the predetermined spatial relationship between the moveable element and the second sensor.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for localizing a sensor in a vehicle, the method comprising: - capturing, by means of a first sensor (10) being mounted on a vehicle, at least one image of a moveable element (14) of the vehicle,
the moveable element (14) having a predetermined spatial relationship to a second sensor (20) being mounted on the vehicle, the moveable element (14) being moveable relative to the first sensor (10); - determining a spatial information on the moveable element (14) on the basis of the at least one image; and - localizing the second sensor (20) on the basis of the spatial information by means of a transformation rule, the transformation rule representing the predetermined spatial relationship between the moveable element (14) and the second sensor (20).
2. The method of one of the preceding claims,
further comprising matching a geometrical model (50) of the moveable element (14) to the at least one image by using a matching algorithm, wherein the spatial information is determined on the basis of the matched model (50), and
wherein the matching algorithm preferably comprises a particle algorithm, a grid-search algorithm and/or a regression algorithm.
3. The method of claim 2,
wherein the matching comprises: - generating a plurality of sample points (a, a1, a2, e1, e2) for the geometrical model (50), each of the sample points (a, a1, a2, e1, e2) having a spatial position; - determining, for at least some of the sample points (a, a1, a2, e1, e2), a plurality of sample pixels of the at least one image, each of the pixels having a respective pixel value; - computing a rating function on the basis of the sample pixels; - determining the matched model (50) on the basis of the rating function.
4. The method according to claim 3,
wherein a first group of the sample points (a, a1, e1, e2) are located on the model (50), and a second group of the sample points (e2) are located outside the model (50), wherein difference pixel values are computed for sample points between the first and second group, and wherein the rating function is computed on the basis of the difference values.
5. The method according to one of the preceding claims,
further comprising processing of the at least one image or a portion thereof by means of a neural network for obtaining an output,
wherein the spatial information is determined on the basis of the output.
6. The method according to one of the preceding claims,
wherein the at least one image comprises three-dimensional image data.
7. The method according to one of the preceding claims,
wherein the spatial information comprises a position and/or an orientation of the moveable element (14).
8. The method according to one of the preceding claims,
wherein the moveable element comprises at least a portion of one of the following: - a steering element (14) of the vehicle, - a housing of the second sensor (20), - a steering element column (15) of the vehicle, - a headrest of a vehicle seat.
9. The method according to one of the preceding claims,
wherein the first sensor (10) is mounted on one of the following portions of the vehicle: - an inner side of a roof, - a pillar of a vehicle body, - a headrest of a seat, - a seat backrest.
10. The method according to one of claims 1 to 7,
wherein the second sensor (20) is mounted on a steering wheel column (15) of the vehicle, the steering wheel column (15) being moveable relative to the first sensor (10) and comprising the moveable element (14), wherein the second sensor (20) is configured to take images of a vehicle seat in which a passengers body or a portion thereof is expected to be located when the passenger is sitting on the vehicle seat.
11. The method according to one of the preceding claims,
wherein the moveable element (14) comprises a reflective surface having reflective properties being adapted to the first sensor (10).
12. The method according to claim 11,
wherein the reflective properties are limited to a range of wavelengths being invisible to human eyes.
13. A device for localizing a sensor in a vehicle, the device comprising: - an input for receiving at least one image captured by a first sensor (10), - a processing unit (16, 18) configured to determine a location of a second sensor (20) by carrying out the method according to at least one of the preceding claims, wherein the processing unit (16, 18) is further configured to process images captured by the second sensor (20) with respect to the location of the second sensor (20) or to output the location.
14. A non-transitory computer readable medium comprising instructions, which when executed by a processing unit (16, 18), cause the processing unit (16, 18) to carry out the method of one of claims 1 to 12.
15. A system comprising the device according to claim 13,
wherein the system comprises a first sensor (10) and a second sensor (20), wherein at least the first sensor (10) is connected to the device (16).
