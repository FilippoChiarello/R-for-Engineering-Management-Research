<title>
CATEGORIZING A SENSITIVE DATA FIELD IN A DATASET
</title>

<abstract>
Some embodiments are directed to a categorization system for categorizing a sensitive data field in a dataset, e.g., a disease classification according to the ICD classification. A client device is to obtain categories for one or more records of the dataset. The client device determines categorization data for the categorization. The categorization data comprises homomorphic encryptions of possible values of the sensitive data field and encodings of the categories associated to the respective possible values, thus keeping the categorization secret. A data provider device stores the dataset and determines homomorphic encryptions indicating differences between the value of the sensitive data field for a record and respective possible values. A categorization device determines which of those encryptions indicates a match and provides a category encoding associated with a matching possible value to the client device. The client device associates the encoded category to the record.
