ANTICIPATORY DEPTH OF FIELD ADJUSTMENT FOR OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for surface inspection of an object using optical coherence tomography (OCT) with anticipatory depth of field adjustment is provided. The method includes determining a present working distance and one or more forward working distances; determining a present depth of field in which the surface of the object is in focus at the location of the present working distance and at as many of the consecutive forward surface locations as determined possible; changing to the present depth of field; performing an A-scan of the object; moving the object such that the scanner head is directed at each of the consecutive forward surface locations determined to be in the present depth of field; and performing an A-scan at each of the consecutive forward surface locations determined to be in the present depth of field.

1. 1-19. (canceled)
20. A method of surface inspection of an object using optical coherence tomography (OCT), the OCT having an associated tunable depth of field comprising a distance range, the method comprising: determining a present depth of field having a series of surface locations on the object located within the associated distance range; tuning the tunable depth of field to the present depth of field; and performing a scan of the object at each surface location in the series of surface locations.
21. The method of claim 20, wherein the object is moveable, and wherein the series of the surface locations are sequentially located opposite a direction of travel of the object.
22. The method of claim 20, wherein the scan of the object comprises an A-scan.
23. The method of claim 21, wherein the scan for each of the surface locations that are sequentially located opposite the direction of travel of the object are combined to form a B-scan.
24. The method of claim 20, further comprising: determining a subsequent depth of field having a subsequent series of surface locations on the object located within the associated distance range; tuning the tunable depth of field to the subsequent depth of field; and performing a scan of the object at each surface location in the subsequent series of surface locations.
25. The method of claim 24, wherein determining the present depth of field and the subsequent depth of field each comprise measuring a distance between the scanner head and each surface location of the object.
26. The method of claim 24, wherein determining the present depth of field and the subsequent depth of field each comprise determining a distance between the scanner head and each surface location of the object using surface geometry of the object.
27. The method of claim 22, using the A-scans data, the method further comprising detecting a feature on a surface or subsurface of the object using a neural network trained using a training set, the training set comprising A-scans data labelled with the feature.
28. The method of claim 27, wherein the feature comprises a working distance of the surface of the object from a scanner head.
29. The method of claim 28, further comprising further tuning the tunable depth of field based on the working distance.
