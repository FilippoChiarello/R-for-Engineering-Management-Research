METHOD FOR PREDICTING THE RESPONSE OF MELANOMA PATIENTS TO A MEDICAMENT
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a method for determining or predicting the response of a patient diagnosed with melanoma to targeted pharmacotherapy. The present invention also aims to provide methods and devices for predicting the response of patients diagnosed with melanoma to specific medicaments. More specifically, the present invention provides methods which measure kinase and/or phosphatase activity by studying phosphorylation levels and profiles and inhibitions thereof by drugs in samples, preferably blood samples, of said patients.

<claims>
1. A method for predicting the response of a patient diagnosed with melanoma cancer, to a medicament, comprising the steps of: (a) measuring the kinase and/or phosphatase activity of a sample, obtained from said patient diagnosed with melanoma, by contacting said sample with at least one protein kinase substrate and/or at least one protein phosphatase substrate, thereby providing a phosphorylation profile of said sample, said phosphorylation profile comprising the phosphorylation levels of phosphorylation sites present in at least 10 peptide markers as listed in Table 1 and/or Table 3, and/or in at least 10 peptide markers as listed Table 2; and, (b) determining from said phosphorylation profile the response of said patient to said medicament.
2. Method according to claim 1, wherein said sample is obtained from a blood sample of said patient diagnosed with melanoma.
3. Method according to claims 2, wherein said blood sample comprises peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
4. Method according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein said medicament is chosen from the list comprising Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, Prembrolizumab, Pidilizumab, BMS-936559, Atezolizumab and/or analogs thereof and/or a combination thereof.
5. Method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein said phosphorylation profiles comprise the phosphorylation levels of phosphorylation sites present in at least 30 of the peptide markers as listed in Table 1 and/or Table 3, and/or in at least 30 of the peptide markers as listed in Table 2.
6. Method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein said phosphorylation profiles comprise the phosphorylation levels of phosphorylation sites present in the peptide markers as listed in Table 1, Table 3 and/or Table 2.
7. Method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein step (b) is replaced by a step (c) calculating a classifier parameter from said phosphorylation profile; and a step (d) determining the response of said patient to said medicament on the basis of said classifier parameter.
8. Method according to claim 7, wherein said classifier parameter indicates said patient being a good responder to said medicament if said classifier parameter is above a first predetermined threshold level, and wherein said classifier parameter indicates said patient being a poor responder to said medicament if said classifier parameter is below a second predetermined threshold level.
9. Method according to claims 7 or 8, wherein step (b) is replaced by a step (e) comparing said phosphorylation profile to a first and a second reference phosphorylation profile; said first reference phosphorylation profile being representative for a good responder to said medicament and said second reference phosphorylation profile being representative for a poor responder to said medicament; and a step (f) determining response of said patient to said medicament on the basis of the comparison of said phosphorylation profile with said first and said second reference phosphorylation profile.
10. The method according to any of claims 7 to 9, wherein said phosphorylation profile or said classifier parameter indicates good response, poor response or undetermined response of said patient to said medicament.
11. The method according to any of claims 1 to 10, wherein said melanoma is an irresectable stage IIIc or IV melanoma.
12. The method according to any of claims 1 to 11, wherein from the measurements in step (a) the toxicity of said medicament in said patient is determined.
13. A method for diagnosing melanoma for a patient, wherein the kinase and/or phosphatase activity of a sample, obtained from said patient, is measured, wherein said kinase and/or phosphatase activity measurement provides phosphorylation profiles of said sample thereby diagnosing melanoma for said patient.
14. The method according claim 13, wherein said phosphorylation profiles comprise the phosphorylation levels of phosphorylation sites present in at least 10 peptide markers as listed in Table 1 and/or Table 3, and/or at least 10 peptide markers as listed in Table 2.
15. A computer program product for use in conjunction with a computer having a processor and a memory connected to the processor, said computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having a computer program mechanism encoded thereon, wherein said computer program mechanism may be loaded into the memory of said computer and cause said computer to carry out the method of any one of claims 1 to 13.
