<abstract>
A system and/or method for assisting individuals in a building, including locating first and second mobile devices using a position determining system. The first mobile device is uniquely associated with an individual. The second mobile device is uniquely associated with a service technician. A server communicates with the position determining system, the first mobile device, and the second mobile devices. The server generates, an importance ranking in relation to a request from the first mobile device. The server, on the basis of the importance ranking of the request, the position of the first mobile device, and the position of the second mobile device, sends a message to the second mobile device for assistance for the individual associated with the respective first mobile device, wherein the message comprises the position of the respective first mobile device.
