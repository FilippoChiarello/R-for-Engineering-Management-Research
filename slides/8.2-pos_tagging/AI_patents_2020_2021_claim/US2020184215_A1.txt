PHOTOGRAPHIC RESULTS BY COMPOSITION ANALYSIS USING DEEP LEARNING NEURAL NETWORKS
</title>

<abstract>
A method, system and computer program product for improving photographic results by composition analysis using deep-learning neural networks, by: detecting one or more objects in a camera view; classifying the objects to make one or more composition recommendations; and displaying the composition recommendations in the camera view, wherein the camera view is aligned with one of the composition recommendations to take a picture.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method, comprising: improving photographic results by composition analysis using deep-learning neural networks, by: detecting one or more objects in a camera view; classifying the objects to make one or more composition recommendations; and displaying the composition recommendations in the camera view, wherein the camera view is aligned with one of the composition recommendations to take a picture.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising training one or more models of the deep-learning neural networks for detecting and classifying objects in images.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising training a first one of the models to detect different sizes and types of objects, and to generate object outlines for the objects.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising training a second one of the models to classify the object outlines as representing one or more geometric shapes, and to label the object outlines with a composition type for the geometric shapes.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein detecting the one or more objects in the camera view comprises identifying one or more object outlines, types and locations for the objects in the camera view.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising performing object confirmation by displaying the object outlines overlaying the objects in the camera view, wherein a user selects an object and its object outline.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the selected object and its object outline becomes a focus of the camera view.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising providing suggestions to the user to make the selected object and its object outline a suitable size in the camera view, after calculating an area or height ratio and a suitable range for the selected object and its object outline.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the suggestions include distance and size suggestions.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein classifying the objects to make the one or more composition recommendations comprises classifying the one or more object outlines as representing one or more geometric shapes.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the composition recommendations are displayed by overlaying the camera view, so that the camera view can be aligned with one of the composition recommendations.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the composition recommendations include a geometric shape and its position in the camera view.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the user selects the one of the composition recommendations.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein the user indicates that the one or more composition recommendations are not satisfactory, and that the camera view should be retaken.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein the user aligns the camera view with one of the composition recommendations to take a picture.
16. A computer-implemented system, comprising: one or more computers programmed for improving photographic results by composition analysis using deep-learning neural networks, by: detecting one or more objects in a camera view; classifying the objects to make one or more composition recommendations; and displaying the composition recommendations in the camera view, wherein the camera view is aligned with one of the composition recommendations to take a picture.
17. The system of claim 16, further comprising training one or more models of the deep-learning neural networks for detecting and classifying objects in images, including training a first one of the models to detect different sizes and types of objects, and to generate object outlines for the objects, and training a second one of the models to classify the object outlines as representing one or more geometric shapes, and to label the object outlines with a composition type for the geometric shapes.
18. The system of claim 16, wherein detecting the one or more objects in the camera view comprises: identifying one or more object outlines, types and locations for the objects in the camera view; performing object confirmation by displaying the object outlines overlaying the objects in the camera view, wherein a user selects an object and its object outline, wherein the selected object and its object outline becomes a focus of the camera view; and providing suggestions to the user to make the selected object and its object outline a suitable size in the camera view, after calculating an area or height ratio and a suitable range for the selected object and its object outline, wherein the suggestions include distance and size suggestions.
19. The system of claim 16, wherein classifying the objects to make the one or more composition recommendations comprises: classifying the one or more object outlines as representing one or more geometric shapes, wherein the composition recommendations are displayed by overlaying the camera view, so that the camera view can be aligned with one of the composition recommendations, wherein the composition recommendations include a geometric shape and its position in the camera view, and wherein the user selects the one of the composition recommendations.
20. A computer program product, the computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by one or more computers to cause the computers to perform a method, comprising: improving photographic results by composition analysis using deep-learning neural networks, by: detecting one or more objects in a camera view; classifying the objects to make one or more composition recommendations; and displaying the composition recommendations in the camera view, wherein the camera view is aligned with one of the composition recommendations to take a picture.
