<title>
DISEASE DIAGNOSIS USING LITERATURE SEARCH
</title>

<abstract>
Technology for predicting potential disease diagnoses of patients is disclosed. In an example, data associated with a patient is accessed. The data is divided into one or more queries. Each of the one or more queries is associated with one or more keywords. For each of the one or more queries, a plurality of literatures based on the one or more keywords is generated. A plurality of terms extracted from each of the plurality of literatures for each of the one or more queries is merged into a combined list of terms. One or more potential diagnoses are provided based on the combined list of terms.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising: accessing data associated with a patient; dividing the data into one or more queries, wherein each of the one or more queries is associated with one or more keywords; generating, for each of the one or more queries, a plurality of literatures based on the one or more keywords; merging a plurality of terms extracted from each of the plurality of literatures for each of the one or more queries into a combined list of terms; and providing, by a processing device, one or more potential diagnoses based on the combined list of terms.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the data comprises one or more of: a health record; or a user input.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: preprocessing the one or more queries to remove an uninformative keyword from the one or more keywords.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: calculating a rank for each of the plurality of literatures for each of the one or more queries based on a relevance score associated with each of the plurality of literatures.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the relevance score is calculated based on a number of matches between the plurality of terms from each of the plurality of literatures and the one or more keywords for each of the queries.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein the rank is calculated using a Bayesian language model with Dirichlet priors.
7. The method of claim 4, wherein the plurality of literatures comprise a specified number of literatures.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the specified number of literatures is determined based on a difference between the relevance score of two consecutively ranked literatures having a largest value.
9. The method of claim 4, wherein the plurality of terms is determined based on an overall score calculated for each of the plurality of terms.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the overall score is calculated based on a term score indicating a term frequency-inverse document frequency for a particular term of the plurality of terms and the relevance score associated with a particular literature corresponding to the particular term.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of terms is determined by identifying, using a medical language library, a set of terms to remove from an initial set of extracted terms from each of the plurality of literatures.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising: grouping one or more synonymous terms of the plurality of terms under a unique identifier corresponding to a potential diagnosis of the one or more potential diagnoses.
13. A method comprising: causing for display, by a processing device, a graphical user interface comprising: a first display component graphically depicting a health record associated with a patient, wherein the health record is divided into one or more sections, each of the one or more sections corresponding to a distinct medical episode; a second display component providing a plurality of literatures associated with the health record, wherein the plurality of literatures is generated based on one or more keywords associated with the health record; and a third display component providing one or more potential diagnoses based on terms extracted from each of the plurality of literatures associated with the health record.
14. The method of claim 13, further comprising: detecting a change in the health record; and responsive to the change in the health record, updating the first display component to depict the changed health record; updating the second display component to depict an updated plurality of literatures associated with the changed health record; and updating the third display component to provide an updated one or more potential diagnoses based on the changed health record.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein the health record comprises data input by a user.
16. A system comprising: a memory; and a processing device coupled with the memory to: receive one or more user input associated with a patient; divide the one or more user input into one or more queries, wherein each of the one or more queries is associated with one or more keywords; generate, for each of the one or more queries, a plurality of literatures based on the one or more keywords; merge a plurality of terms extracted from each of the plurality of literatures for each of the one or more queries into a combined list of terms; and provide one or more potential diagnoses based on the combined list of terms.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein the processing device is further to: calculate a rank for each of the plurality of literatures for each of the one or more queries based on a relevance score associated with each of the plurality of literatures.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the relevance score is calculated based on a number of matches between the plurality of terms from each of the plurality of literatures and the one or more keywords for each of the queries.
19. A non-transitory computer readable storage medium encoding instructions thereon that, in response to execution by one or more processing devices, cause the processing device to perform operations comprising: accessing a health record associated with a patient; dividing the health record into one or more queries, wherein each of the one or more queries is associated with one or more keywords; generating, for each of the one or more queries, a plurality of literatures based on the one or more keywords; merging a plurality of terms extracted from each of the plurality of literatures for each of the one or more queries into a combined list of terms; and providing one or more potential diagnoses based on the combined list of terms.
20. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 19, wherein the plurality of literatures comprise a specified number of literatures.
