Apparatus, video processing unit and method for clustering events in a content addressable memory
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus, vision processing unit, and method are provided for clustering motion events in a content addressable memory. A motion event is received including coordinates in an image frame that have experienced a change and a timestamp of the change. A determination is made as to whether determine whether there is a valid entry in the memory having coordinates within a predefined range of coordinates included in the motion event. In response to a determination that there is the valid entry having the coordinates within the predefined range of coordinates included in the motion event, write to the valid entry the coordinates and the timestamp in the motion event.
