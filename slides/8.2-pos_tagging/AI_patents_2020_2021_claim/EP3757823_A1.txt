LOW LATENCY MATRIX MULTIPLY UNIT
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and apparatus for a matrix multiply unit implemented as a systolic array of cells are disclosed. Each cell of the matrix multiply includes: a weight matrix register configured to receive a weight input from either a transposed or a non-transposed weight shift register; a transposed weight shift register configured to receive a weight input from a horizontal direction to be stored in the weight matrix register; a non-transposed weight shift register configured to receive a weight input from a vertical direction to be stored in the weight matrix register; and a multiply unit that is coupled to the weight matrix register and configured to multiply the weight input of the weight matrix register with a vector data input in order to obtain a multiplication result.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A cell of a plurality of cells arranged in an array of a matrix multiply unit, the cell comprising: a weight matrix register configured to receive a weight input of a neural network from one or more weight shift registers, wherein the one or more weight shift registers are configured to receive a plurality of weight inputs of the neural network from a first direction of the array or a second direction of the array, the second direction being different from the first direction; and a multiply unit that is coupled to the weight matrix register, wherein the multiply unit is configured to multiply the received weight input with a vector data input of the neural network to obtain a multiplication result.
2. The cell of claim 1, wherein the multiplication result is a part of a plurality of neural network computations.
3. The cell of claim 2, wherein the multiply unit is configured to multiply the received weight input with another vector data input to obtain another multiplication result, wherein the other multiplication result is another part of the plurality of neural network computations.
4. The cell of any preceding claim, wherein: the array is a systolic array of cells; and/or the array has a two-dimensional format; the first direction of the array is the first direction in the two-dimensional format; and the second direction of the array is the second direction in the two-dimensional format.
5. The cell of any preceding claim, further comprising a multiplexer configured to: select the weight input from the plurality of weight inputs; and send the selected weight input to the weight matrix register.
6. The cell of any preceding claim, wherein the one or more weight shift registers comprise: a first weight shift register configured to receive a first weight input of the plurality of weight inputs over a first wired pathway from a first cell of the plurality of cells that is along the first direction; and a second weight shift register configured to receive a second weight input of the plurality of weight inputs over a second wired pathway from a second cell of the plurality of cells that is along the second direction, wherein the weight input is one of the first weight input and the second weight input.
7. The cell of any preceding claim, wherein the one or more weight shift registers comprise a transposed weight shift register and a non-transposed weight shift register.
8. The cell of claim 7, wherein the non-transposed weight shift register is physically separate from the transposed weight shift register.
9. A method comprising: receiving, by a weight matrix register of a cell of a plurality of cells arranged in an array of a matrix multiply unit, a weight input of a neural network from one or more weight shift registers, wherein the one or more weight shift registers receive a plurality of weight inputs of the neural network from a first direction of the array or a second direction of the array, wherein the second direction is different from the first direction; and multiplying, by a multiply unit that is coupled to the weight matrix register, the weight input with a vector data input of the neural network to obtain a multiplication result.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the multiplication result is a part of a plurality of neural network computations, the method optionally further comprising:
multiplying, by the multiply unit, the received weight input with another vector data input to obtain another multiplication result, wherein the other multiplication result is another part of the plurality of neural network computations.
11. The method of claim 9 or 10, wherein: the array is a systolic array of cells; and/or the array has a two-dimensional format; the first direction of the array is the first direction in the two-dimensional format; and the second direction of the array is the second direction in the two-dimensional format.
12. The method of any of claims 9 to 11, further comprising: selecting, by a multiplexer, the weight input from the plurality of weight inputs; and receiving, by the weight matrix register, the selected weight input from the multiplexer.
13. The method of any of claims 9 to 12, wherein the one or more weight shift registers comprise a transposed weight shift register and a non-transposed weight shift register, and optionally wherein the non-transposed weight shift register is physically separate from the transposed weight shift register.
14. The method of any of claims 9 to 13, wherein the one or more weight shift registers comprise: a first weight shift register configured to receive a first weight input of the plurality of weight inputs over a first wired pathway from a first cell of the plurality of cells that is along the first direction; and a second weight shift register configured to receive a second weight input of the plurality of weight inputs over a second wired pathway from a second cell of the plurality of cells that is along the second direction, wherein the weight input is one of the first weight input and the second weight input.
15. A non-transitory computer program product storing instructions that, when executed by at least one programmable processor, cause the at least one programmable processor to perform the method of any of claims 9 to 14.
