METABOLOME SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS METHOD FOR ANALYZING METABOLOME DURING SYNTHETIC GAS FERMENTATION OF SYNTHETIC GAS FERMENTATION MICROORGANISMS
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a metabolome sampling and analysis method for analyzing metabolome during synthetic gas fermentation of a synthetic gas fermentation microorganisms, the method establishing an optimal condition for metabolome sampling and enabling a glucose culture and a synthetic gas culture of the synthetic gas fermentation microorganisms to be distinguished by using a selected metabolomic biomarker.

<claims>
1. A kit for distinguishing a glucose culture and a synthetic gas culture of a synthetic gas fermentation microorganisms, comprising a quantitative apparatus for at least one metabolite selected from the group consisting of palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, heptadecanoic acid, 1-monopalmitin, alanine, N-methylalanine, adenosine, glycerol-1-phosphate, and valine.
2. The kit of claim 1, wherein the quantitative apparatus is a gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOF MS) analysis device.
3. The kit of claim 1, wherein the synthetic gas fermentation microorganisms in the glucose culture shows a tendency that alanine, N-methylalanine, adenosine, glycerol-1-phosphate, and valine increase in the metabolome and a tendency that palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, heptadecanoic acid, and 1-monopalmitin decrease in the metabolome.
4. The kit of claim 1, wherein the synthetic gas fermentation microorganisms in the synthetic gas culture shows a tendency that palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, heptadecanoic acid, and 1-monopalmitin increase in the metabolome and a tendency that alanine, N-methylalanine, adenosine, glycerol-1-phosphate, and valine decrease in the metabolome.
5. The kit of claim 1, wherein the synthetic gas fermentation microorganism is Clostridium carboxidivorans.
6. A method for analyzing metabolomic differentiation for distinguishing a glucose culture and a synthetic gas culture of a synthetic gas fermentation microorganism, the method comprising: a metabolome sampling step of subjecting a biological sample of the synthetic gas fermentation microorganism to fast filtration under an aerobic condition, washing the filtrate with water, and then extracting a metabolome using a mixed solvent of water, 2-propanol, and methanol as an extraction solvent.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising: analyzing the extracted metabolome with a gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOF MS) analysis device: converting a GC/TOF MS analysis result into statistically processable values; and statistically verifying the differentiation between two biological sample groups for distinguishing the glucose culture and the synthetic gas culture of the synthetic gas fermentation microorganism by using the converted values.
8. The method of claim 6, wherein the converting of the GC/TOF MS analysis result into statistically processable values determines, as a representative value of unit time, the largest value of an area or height of a chromatogram peak appearing during the unit time by dividing the total analysis time by a unit time interval.
9. The method of claim 6, wherein the statistically verifying of the differentiation between two biological samples for distinguishing the glucose culture and the synthetic gas culture of the synthetic gas fermentation microorganism by using the converted values analyzes and verifies a metabolomic biomarker which shows a significant difference between the two biological sample groups by performing a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA).
10. The method of claim 9, wherein a positive loading value of the partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) shows an increasing tendency of the metabolomic biomarker, and a negative loading value of the partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) shows a decreasing tendency of the metabolomic biomarker.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the metabolomic biomarker comprises palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, heptadecanoic acid, 1-monopalmitin, alanine, N-methylalanine, adenosine, glycerol-1-phosphate, and valine.
12. The method of claim 6, wherein the anaerobic culture microorganism is Clostridium carboxidivorans.
