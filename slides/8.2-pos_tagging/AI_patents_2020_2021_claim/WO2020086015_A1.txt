A SYSTEM THAT PERCEIVES, REPORTS FATIGUE AND DISTRACTION OF THE DRIVER AND PROCESSES BIG DATA AND A METHOD OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION
</title>

<abstract>
The invention is a system that detects and reports fatigue and distraction of the driver (204) which is characterized as having the following steps: the driver (204) getting on the vehicle will start the engine (401), the camera (102a, 102b) monitoring the driver (204) will run (402), collection of all data via GPS and transmission of this data via GPS (406) and checking if there is any 'incident' by comparing the data collected with the threshold values identified and fatigue, phone usage etc. negative behaviors that are intended to be captured regarding to driver (204) (407).

C L A I M S
1. A system that detects and reports fatigue and distraction of the driver (204) characterized in that; it comprises,
- the software capable of detecting face and periphery, eyes, mouth, handarm movements of the driver (204) based on artificial intelligence and deep learning, processing the image that monitors the seatbelt (205) on the left shoulder of the driver (204) from the moment of starting the engine till stopping on the vehicle (306), processing related data if the decibel meter of the device (101) detects loud music and running expected function following it, receiving measurable data such as sudden deceleration, sudden acceleration, sudden cornering, compiling the vehicle (306) location, previous route, future route if desired, ensuring sending of all footage recorded by all cameras (302) in the vehicle (306) from the moment of starting the engine till stopping on the vehicle (306) to the central server (303), associating the incident moment with these footage before and after the requested time frame when a history log or report is required in case of an incident,
the device (101) where aforesaid software is embedded, featuring a memory, decibel meter, GSM, GPS, GYRO, Bluetooh modules on it, capable of obtaining data from the vehicle (306) and cameras (302), a speaker that will warn the driver (204) in case of an incident through the optional management buttons,
cameras (302) not limited with numbers, which are installed on the vehicle and monitor the front, sides and read sections,
the central server (303) where all data is stored and which is suitable for processing big data
and a command and control center (305) which monitors entire system, connects to the vehicle if a warning comes from the vehicles (306), connects to the cameras (302) to the vehicle depending on the identified workflow, reaches to the driver (204) and/or command and control center (305) via call and/or SMS and/or e-mail where and when deemed necessary, compiles periodical reports, shares them with the customer and public, makes comments and referrals when and where deemed necessary and carries out information and report preparation activities on accident analysis and subsequent actions such as trainings.
2. A system mentioned in Claim 1 characterized in that; the device (101), which receives its power from the vehicle's power supply (105), has a battery that feeds the system for energy outages.
3. A system mentioned in Claim 1 characterized in that; the device (101) is positioned in the vehicle (306) in a visible or invisible manner in the glove compartment or in a suitable location on the front panel.
4. A system mentioned in Claim 1 characterized in that; the device (101) monitors the driver's (204) face and the periphery, eyes, mouth, hand movements and whether the driver (204) fastens the seatbelt (205) from the left shoulder continuously from the starting till stopping the vehicle
(306) by using the cameras (l02a, l02b).
5. A method that detects and reports fatigue and distraction of the driver characterized in that; it contains the following process steps,
The driver (204) getting on the vehicle will start the engine (401), the camera (l02a, l02b) monitoring the driver (204) will run (402), checking whether the driver (204) was previously introduced to the system or the right driver (204) is the correct driver who must have worked on that time (403),
starting the driving if the result of software check on whether the driver (204) was previously introduced to the system or the right driver (204) is the correct driver who must have worked on that time is "yes (404), notifying the call center and/or the official of the vehicle owner via call, SMS or e-mail if the result of software check on whether the driver (204) was previously introduced to the system or the right driver (204) is the correct driver who must have worked on that time is "no" (405) collection of all data via GPS with internal and external cameras (302) and transmitting this data via GSM network (307) (406),
and checking if there is any "incident" by comparing the data collected with the threshold values identified and fatigue, phone usage etc. negative behaviors that are intended to be captured regarding to driver (204) (407).
6. A method mentioned in Claim 5 characterized in that; the incidents checked during checking if there is any "incident" by comparing the data collected with the threshold values identified and fatigue, phone usage etc. negative behaviors that are intended to be captured regarding to driver (204) (407) are any, one, more than one and all of following:
Whether the driver (204) is the correct driver (204),
Whether the driver (204) complies with working hours and breaks, Determination of the fatigue of the driver (204) from the facial expression and the length of blinking,
abnormal movements with the head,
increases in mouth movements,
Generation of a phone conversation or messaging movement pattern with his/her hand and arm movements and this movement caught by the camera
(l02a, l02b) and whether the driver (204) uses phone,
moves his/her hands and arms continuously just like eating and drinking something,
Moving the hands and arms continuously just like smoking, whether the diver (204) smokes and other distracting behaviors of the driver (204), if the driver has not fastened the seatbelt (205) on the left shoulder or chest Vehicle's sudden deceleration, sudden acceleration and sudden cornering. Creation of a noisy environment exceeding the defined decibel value.
7. A method mentioned in Claim 5 characterized in that; it comprises process sub-steps of notifying the the command and control center (305) and/or the official of the vehicle (306) owner via call, SMS or e-mail in case of any incident as the result of checking if there is any "incident" by comparing the data collected with the threshold values identified and fatigue, phone usage etc. negative behaviors that are intended to be captured regarding to driver (204) (407) and storing data anyway even if there is no incident (409).
8. A method mentioned in Claim 5 characterized in that; the system identification of threshold values to be used for information and reporting on the incidents checked during checking if there is any "incident" by comparing the data collected with the threshold values identified and fatigue, phone usage etc. negative behaviors that are intended to be captured regarding to driver (204) (407) is composed of following process sub-steps,
the relevant official accesses the relevant screen of the software with the password given to him/her (501).
The official then enters the relevant fields in the system with the parameters of the threshold values that will trigger audible and/or visual alarms, reports, SMS, telephone and e-mail alerts according to company rules and legal requirements (502) and
The system will trigger audible and/or visual alarms, reports, SMS, telephone and e-mail alerts considering these parameters (503).
9. A method mentioned in Claim 5 characterized in that; it comprises following process sub-steps if the driver (204) has not been identified to the system before, The fleet official shall introduce a pas sportsize photograph or the biometric photograph of the driver (204) to the software through a camera (601).
The software will take into account these values defined in telephone, SMS and e-mail alerts according to biometric data (602).
