<title>
Context-dependent authentication system, method and device
</title>

<abstract>
A method for authenticating a user using a user device connected to a communications network, the method comprising an implicit phase, wherein said implicit phase comprises performing at least one task within a workflow, said at least one task necessary to move forward within said workflow; storing information associated with said performing of at least one task; comparing said stored information with a stored user profile; and determining whether said authentication of said user is successful or unsuccessful based on said comparing.

<claims>
1. A method for authenticating a transaction, the method comprising: monitoring, by a transaction authentication information unit of a first device, for an initiation of an authentication transaction, the first device comprising a user interface and a first sensor; initiating, by the transaction authentication information unit, an authentication workflow comprising a user specific authentication context and an explicit authentication task, the user specific authentication context based on a plurality of user specific information; receiving, by the transaction authentication information unit, a first data set obtained from the first sensor associated with a first user specific authentication context; receiving, by the transaction authentication information unit, a second data set associated with a second device characteristic of a second device; the transaction authentication information unit dynamically calculating a first weighting for the first data set and a second weighting for the second data set, the first weighting being adapted based on the first data set, the second weighting being adapted based on the second data set; determining, by the transaction authentication information unit, a correlation between the first data set and the second data set based on the first weighting, the second weighting, the first data set and the second data set; authenticating, by the transaction authentication information unit, the transaction based on the correlation; wherein if the correlation is less than a threshold, the authentication is unsuccessful and the transaction authentication information unit initiates the explicit authentication task with a user of the first device or the second device, the explicit authentication task comprising a query to the user regarding validation of the transaction.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the first device is a user's mobile device used in a purchase, and the second device is a merchant's payment terminal.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the characteristic comprises the velocity and acceleration of the first device.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein the first device comprises a user input and the characteristic comprises the input characteristics of the received user input.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the second device is a user's mobile device used in a purchase, and the first device is a merchant's payment terminal.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein the first weighting is based on a characteristic of the first device and initially having a first value, the first weighting being dynamically decreased if the correlation is low.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein the first device and the second device are the same device, the first data set and the second data set based on different parameters.
8. A method for authenticating a transaction by a fraud detection server coupled to a communications network, the method comprising: monitoring, by the fraud detection server, for an initiation of a transaction; initiating, by the fraud detection server, an authentication workflow comprising a user specific authentication context and an explicit authentication task, the user specific authentication context based on a plurality of user specific information; receiving, by the fraud detection server, a first data set from a first sensor of a first device, the first data set associated with a first user specific authentication context; receiving, by the fraud detection server, a second data set associated with a second device characteristic of a second device; the fraud detection server dynamically calculating a first weighting for the first data set and a second weighting for the second data set, the first weighting being adapted based on the first data set, the second data weighting being adapted based on the second data set; determining, by the fraud detection server, a correlation between the first data set and the second data set based on the first weighting, the second weighting, the first data set and the second data set; authenticating, by the the fraud detection server, the transaction, based on the correlation; wherein if the correlation is less than a threshold, the transaction is unsuccessful and the fraud detection server initiates the explicit authentication task with a user of the first device or a user of the second device; the explicit authentication task comprising: a query to the user regarding validation of the transaction, a response to the query by the user being stored in a database of a crowdsourced transaction history of a merchant associated with the transaction, the crowdsourced transaction history being used when calculating the threshold.
9. The method of claim 8 wherein the response to the query by the user comprises information from the user indicating that the transaction should be rejected.
10. The method of claim 8 wherein the response to the query by the user comprises information from the user indicating that the transaction is fraudulent.
11. The method of claim 8 wherein the response to the query by the user comprises a risk level that the transaction may be fraudulent, the risk level based on a history of transactions associated with the merchant.
12. The method of claim 11 wherein the risk level is also based on a volume of transactions.
13. The method of claim 11 wherein the risk level is based on a volume of transactions over time.
14. The method of claim 11 wherein the risk level is based on a comparison of comparable merchants in proximity to the merchant.
