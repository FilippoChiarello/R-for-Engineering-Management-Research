<title>
System, method, program for display on wearable terminal
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention is to identify the type of the farm product in a view through the wearable terminal and display the expected harvest time on the display of a wearable terminal in augmented reality. The system for displaying the harvest time of a farm product on the display of a wearable terminal, includes: an image acquisition unit that acquires the image of a farm product in a view through the wearable terminal; an identification unit that analyzes the image and identifies the type of the farm product; a selection unit that selects a determination criterion according to the type; a determination unit that analyzes the image based on the determination criterion and determines the color and the size; an estimation unit that estimates the harvest time of the farm product based on the determination result; and a harvest time display unit that displays the estimated harvest time of the farm product seen through the display of the wearable terminal thereon in augmented reality.

<claims>
1. A system for displaying the harvest time of a farm product on the display of a wearable terminal, comprising: an image acquisition unit that acquires the image of a farm product in a view through the wearable terminal; an identification unit that analyzes the image and identifies the type of the farm product; a selection unit that selects a determination criterion according to the type; a determination unit that analyzes the image based on the determination criterion and determines the color and the size; an estimation unit that estimates the harvest time of the farm product based on the determination result; and a harvest time display unit that displays the estimated harvest time of the farm product seen through the display of the wearable terminal thereon in augmented reality.
2. The system according to claim 1, wherein the identification unit identifies a farm product at the center of a view through the wearable terminal as a target to be identified.
3. The system according to claim 1, further comprising a weather acquisition unit that acquires the weather forecast for the place where the farm product is growing, wherein the estimation unit estimates the harvest time of the farm product based on the determination result and the acquired weather forecast.
4. The system according to claim 3, further comprising a terminal position acquisition unit that acquires the position of the wearable terminal, wherein the weather acquisition unit acquires the weather forecast for the position of the terminal on the assumption that the position of the terminal is the place where the farm product is growing.
5. The system according to claim 1, further comprising a sound acquisition unit that acquires the sound of the farm product from the microphone of a wearable terminal, wherein the color and the size are determined by analyzing the image, and then the acquired sound is determined, based on the determination criterion.
6. The system according to claim 1, further comprising a mode receiving unit that receives the selection of the mode of the harvest time, wherein the estimation unit estimates the harvest time in the mode for the farm product based on the determination result.
7. The system according to claim 1, further comprising: a detection unit that detects the action to be taken in the displayed harvest time; and an action result display unit that displays the result of the action taken for the farm product seen through the display of the wearable terminal thereon in augmented reality.
8. The system according to claim 1, further comprising: a terminal position acquisition unit that acquires the position of the wearable terminal; an image direction acquisition unit that acquires the image direction of the wearable terminal; a calculation unit that calculates the position of the farm product based on the position of the terminal and the image direction; and an identification unit that identifies the type of the farm product based on the position and the image analysis.
9. The system according to claim 1, further comprising a guideline display unit that displays a guideline to take an image of the farm product on the display of a wearable terminal in augmented reality, wherein the image acquisition unit acquires the image taken according to the guideline.
10. The system according to claim 1, further comprising a selection receiving unit that receives the selection of the farm product seen through the display of the wearable terminal, wherein the harvest time display unit displays the harvest time on the display of a wearable terminal in augmented reality together with the selected object seen through the display.
11. A method for displaying the harvest time of a farm product on the display of a wearable terminal, comprising the steps of acquiring the image of a farm product in a view through the wearable terminal; analyzing the image and identifies the type of the farm product; selecting a determination criterion according to the type; analyzing the image based on the determination criterion and determining the color and the size; estimating the harvest time of the farm product based on the determination result; and displaying the estimated harvest time of the farm product seen through the display of the wearable terminal thereon in augmented reality.
12. A program causing a computer to execute the steps of acquiring the image of a farm product in a view through the wearable terminal; analyzing the image and identifies the type of the farm product; selecting a determination criterion according to the type; analyzing the image based on the determination criterion and determining the color and the size; estimating the harvest time of the farm product based on the determination result; and displaying the estimated harvest time of the farm product seen through the display of the wearable terminal thereon in augmented reality.
