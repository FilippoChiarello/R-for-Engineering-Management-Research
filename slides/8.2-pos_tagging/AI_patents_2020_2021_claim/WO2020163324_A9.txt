METHODS FOR IMPROVED SURGICAL PLANNING USING MACHINE LEARNING AND DEVICES THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, non-transitory computer readable media, and surgical computing devices are illustrated that improve surgical planning using machine learning. With this technology, a machine learning model is trained based on historical case log data sets associated with patients that have undergone a surgical procedure. The machine learning model is applied to current patient data for a current patient to generate a predictor equation. The current patient data comprises anatomy data for an anatomy of the current patient. The predictor equation is optimized to generate a size, position, and orientation of an implant, and resections required to achieve the position and orientation of the implant with respect to the anatomy of the current patient, as part of a surgical plan for the current patient. The machine learning model is updated based on the current patient data and current outcome

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for improved surgical planning using machine learning, comprising:
training at least one machine learning model based on historical case log data sets comprising historical outcome data correlated with one or more of historical patient data, historical implant data, or historical healthcare professional data associated with a plurality of instances of a surgical procedure;
applying the machine learning model to current patient data for a current patient to generate a predictor equation, wherein the current patient data comprises at least anatomy data for an anatomy of the current patient;
optimizing the predictor equation to generate a size, position, and orientation of an implant, and one or more resections required to achieve the position and orientation of the implant with respect to the anatomy of the current patient as part of a surgical plan for the current patient undergoing the surgical procedure; and
updating the machine learning model based on the current patient data and current outcome data generated for the current patient following execution of the surgical plan.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the surgical procedure comprises a knee arthroplasty.
3. The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein the machine learning model comprises an artificial neural network.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the artificial neural network comprises a plurality of input nodes and downstream nodes coupled by connections having associated weighting values.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein each of the weighting values comprises a predictor equation coefficient.
6. The method of any of claims 4-5, further comprising:
obtaining a sensitivity threshold value; and
applying the sensitivity threshold value to disregard one or more of the input nodes.
7. The method of any of claims 4-6, further comprising providing input data comprising signals that correspond with the input nodes to the artificial neural network as seeding data, wherein the input data is extracted from the historical case log data sets.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising altering the weighting values until the artificial neural network is configured to provide a result that corresponds with the historical outcome data.
9. The method of any of the preceding claims, further comprising using one or more of direct Monte Carlo sampling, stochastic tunneling, or parallel tempering to optimize the predictor equation.
10. The method of any of the preceding claims, further comprising:
generating the anatomy data pre-operatively from medical image data of the anatomy of the current patient;
determining an optimized resection envelope for the current patient based on a Boolean intersection of a geometry of the implant and the anatomy data; and
instructing a patient specific knee instrumentation (PSKI) system to remove the optimized resection envelope.
11. The method of any of the preceding claims, further comprising instructing a robotically assisted surgical system to implement one or more portions of the surgical plan.
12. The method of any of the preceding claims, further comprising:
generating an intra-operative algorithm comprising a plurality of recommended actions associated with the surgical plan;
evaluating a result of an execution of one of the recommended actions; and updating one or more inputs to the intra-operative algorithm based on the evaluation to alter another one of the recommended actions to be executed subsequent to the one of the recommended actions.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the one or more inputs are updated based on one or more deviations to the one of the recommended actions.
14. A non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon instructions for improved surgical planning using machine learning comprising executable code that, when executed by one or more processors, causes the processors to implement the method of any of the preceding claims.
15. A surgical computing device comprising memory comprising programmed instructions stored thereon for improved surgical planning using machine learning and one or more processors coupled to the memory and configured to execute the stored programmed instructions to implement the method of any of the preceding claims.
