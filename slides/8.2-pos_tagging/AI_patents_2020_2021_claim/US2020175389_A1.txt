<title>
MEDICAL PROCEDURE ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method for medical procedure assessment and evaluation is provided. The method receives, by a processor, a claim record and stores the claim record as a claim. The method classifies, by the processor, the claim using an intelligent system including an inference engine and knowledge base and classifies, by the processor, a probability of a diagnostic using the intelligent system. The method calculates, by the processor, using the probability of the diagnostic and the claim a probability of consistency of the diagnostic using the intelligent system and presents, by the processor, the probability of consistency of the diagnostic to a user.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for medical procedure evaluation and assessment comprising: receiving, by a processor, a claim record and storing the claim record as a claim; classifying, by the processor, the claim using an intelligent system including an inference engine and a knowledge base; classifying, by the processor, a probability of a diagnostic using the intelligent system; calculating, by the processor, using the probability of the diagnostic and the claim a probability of consistency of the diagnostic using the intelligent system; and presenting, by the processor, the probability of consistency of the diagnostic to a user.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 further comprising training, by the processor, the intelligent system prior to receiving the claim record.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, wherein training the intelligent system comprises providing the intelligent system data representing procedure terminology, disease terminology, and epidemiological data.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the diagnostic is provided in the claim.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the diagnostic is calculated, by the processor, using the intelligent system.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 further comprising approving the claim, by the processor, based on the probability of consistency of the diagnostic.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 further comprising paying the claim, by the processor, based on the probability of consistency of the diagnostic.
8. A system for medical procedure evaluation and assessment comprising: a memory; and a processor coupled to the memory, the processor operable to execute instructions stored in the memory, the instructions causing the processor to: receive a claim record and store the claim record as a claim; classify the claim using an intelligent system including an inference engine and a knowledge base; classify a probability of a diagnostic using the intelligent system; calculate using the probability of the diagnostic and the claim a probability of consistency of the diagnostic using the intelligent system; and present the probability of consistency of the diagnostic to a user.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the processor further trains the intelligent system prior to receiving the claim record.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein training the intelligent system comprises providing the intelligent system data representing procedure terminology, disease terminology, and epidemiological data.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the diagnostic is provided in the claim.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the diagnostic is calculated, by the processor, using the intelligent system.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the processor further approves the claim based on the probability of consistency of the diagnostic.
14. The system of claim 8, wherein the processor further pays the claim based on the probability of consistency of the diagnostic.
15. A computer program product for for medical procedure evaluation and assessment, the computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by a computer, to cause the computer to perform a method comprising: receiving, by a processor of the computer, a claim record and storing the claim record as a claim; classifying, by the processor, the claim using an intelligent system including an inference engine and a knowledge base; classifying, by the processor, a probability of a diagnostic using the intelligent system; calculating, by the processor, using the probability of the diagnostic and the claim a probability of consistency of the diagnostic using the intelligent system; and presenting, by the processor, the probability of consistency of the diagnostic to a user.
16. The computer program product of claim 15, further comprising training, by the processor, the intelligent system prior to receiving the claim record.
17. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein training the intelligent system comprises providing the intelligent system data representing procedure terminology, disease terminology, and epidemiological data.
18. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the diagnostic is provided in the claim.
19. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the diagnostic is calculated, by the processor, using the intelligent system.
20. The computer program product of claim 15 further comprising approving the claim, by the processor, based on the probability of consistency of the diagnostic.
