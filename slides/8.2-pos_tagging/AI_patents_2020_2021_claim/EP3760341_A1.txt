<title>
COMMERCIAL SCALE CASTING PROCESS INCLUDING OPTIMIZATION VIA MULTI-FIDELITY OPTIMIZATION
</title>

<abstract>
A process includes: a first casting modelling stage (22) producing resulting casting parameters; a second casting modelling stage (24) performed using the resulting casting parameters of the first casting modelling stage (22) and of higher fidelity than the first casting modelling stage (22); in parallel with the second casting modelling stage (24), a casting trial (26) using the resulting casting parameters of the first casting modelling stage (22); and evaluating the casting trial (26).
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A process (20) comprising: a first casting modelling stage producing resulting casting parameters, the first casting modelling stage including a low fidelity simulation (22); a second casting modelling stage performed using the resulting casting parameters of the first casting modelling stage, the second casting modelling stage including a high fidelity simulation (24); in parallel with the second casting modelling stage, casting a part in a casting trial (26) using the resulting casting parameters of the first casting modelling stage; and evaluating the casting trial (26) by comparing results of the second casting modelling stage with results of the casting trial (26).
2. The process of claim 1 wherein the first casting modelling stage includes multiple runs of the low fidelity simulation (22), and the second casting stage includes only a single run of the high fidelity simulation (24).
3. The process of claim 1 wherein: the first casting modelling stage includes an evaluation of the resulting casting parameters after the low fidelity simulation (22) and, if the evaluation yields an unsatisfactory result, repeating the low fidelity simulation (22); and the second casting stage includes only a single run of the high fidelity simulation (24).
4. The process of claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein, in response to evaluating the casting trial (26) yielding an unsatisfactory result, the process forks back to within the first casting modelling stage.
5. The process of claim 4 wherein the forking back is to a point dependent on a collation of the casting trial (26), second casting modelling stage, and first casting modelling stage.
6. The process of claim 4 or 5 wherein: the forking back causes the first casting modelling stage to run with an expanded process parameter range relative to the prior run, and, optionally, the expanded process parameter range is created algorithmically by a rules-based modification of a prior run process parameter range, and, optionally, the rules-based modification of a prior run process parameter range expands the process parameter range based on a magnitude of the unsatisfactory result and one or more associated process parameter sensitivities.
7. The process of claim 4, 5 or 6 wherein: the forking back is to a point dependent on the nature of the unsatisfactory result, and, optionally, the first casting modelling stage includes running a solidification model (120); in response to said unsatisfactory result, the forking back is to a point after the solidification model (120); and in response to a further unsatisfactory result, the forking back is to a point before the solidification model (120).
8. The process of claim 4, 5 or 6 wherein: the first casting modelling stage includes running a solidification model (120); the first casting modelling stage includes a determination of variables and regions of interest and/or an optimization and sensitivity analysis of defect risk; and the forking back is to a point after the solidification model (120) but at or before the determination of variables and regions of interest and/or the optimization and sensitivity analysis of defect risk.
9. The process of any preceding claim, further comprising, in response to evaluating the casting trial (26) yielding a satisfactory result, performing commercial scale production of castings (30) using the casting parameters of the satisfactory result.
10. The process of any preceding claim wherein, relative to the second casting modeling stage, the first casting modelling stage involves one or more of: coarser mesh; simplistic approximation of gating features; omission of casting core; simpler furnace model; lower part count per mold; simplification of part features; omission of part features; smaller run time; and fewer iterations.
11. The process of any preceding claim wherein the comparing comprises determining presence in the casting trial (26) of defects not predicted by the second casting modelling stage.
12. The process of any preceding claim wherein: the first casting modelling stage and the second casting modelling stage are performed using a computer system or a connected group of computer systems, and, optionally, the computer system or connected group of computer systems comprises one or more servers (610) and one or more workstations (620); and the one or more servers and one or more workstations (620) have respective scripting language interpreters (710; 812) running respective scripts configured to: compute simulation parameters corresponding to experimental points spanning a process parameter range; execute simulations according to the computed simulation parameters; analyze the relative risk of defects predicted by each executed simulation; and perform an optimization and sensitivity analysis of defect risk in order to determine optimized casting process parameters.
13. A computer system or connected group of computer systems running software configured to: run a first casting modelling stage producing resulting casting parameters; run a second casting modelling stage performed using the resulting casting parameters of the first casting modelling stage and of higher fidelity than the first casting modelling stage; and evaluate a casting trial (26) using the resulting casting parameters of the first casting modelling stage, wherein the evaluating includes comparing the results of the casting trial with results of the second casting modelling stage.
14. The computer system or connected group of computer systems of claim 13 wherein the software is configured to run the casting trial in parallel with the second casting modelling stage.
15. The computer system or connected group of computer systems of claim 13 or 14 comprising: a scripting language interpreter (710; 812) running scripts configured to: compute simulation parameters corresponding to experimental points spanning a process parameter range; execute simulations according to the computed simulation parameters; analyze the relative risk of defects predicted by each executed simulation; and perform an optimization and sensitivity analysis of defect risk in order to determine optimized casting process parameters, and/or one or more servers (610); and one or more workstations (620) networked with the one or more servers (610).
