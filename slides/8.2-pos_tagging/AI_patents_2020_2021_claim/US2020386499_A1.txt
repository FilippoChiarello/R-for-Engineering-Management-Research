WEAPON USAGE TRACKING WITH IDENTITY TAGGING
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided for weapon monitoring and action tagging, including storing a defined weapon action, wherein the defined weapon action is defined based on an inertial measurement from a weapon, the inertial measurement data indicative of at least one of a movement of the weapon, an orientation of the weapon, or a direction of the weapon, receiving sensor information from a weapon, wherein the sensor information includes inertial measurement data, evaluating the sensor information to determine the presence of the defined weapon action, and displaying, in response to determining that the defined weapon action occurred, indicia communicating the occurrence of the defined weapon action to a viewer via a graphical interface.

<claims>
1. An action tagging system for firearm monitoring, the system comprising: an inertial measurement unit configured to generate data indicative of at least one of a movement of the firearm, an orientation of the firearm, or a direction of the firearm; a communication circuit configured to communicate the data generated using the inertial measurement unit to a device external to the firearm; a tagging module to label the firearm with inertial measurement data related to at least one of a movement of the firearm, an orientation of the firearm, or a direction of the firearm within a virtual mapping of a deployment location within which the firearm is located.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the label denotes unholstering the firearm.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the label denotes a discharge.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the label denotes a misfire.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the label denotes an action by a threat within the deployment location.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the label is used at least in part to create at least one machine learning model describing a situational state.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the situational state is a training state.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the situational state is a deployed state.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the situational state is a virtual reality state.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the data generated using the inertial measurement unit relates to a predicted munition velocity.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the data generated using the inertial measurement unit relates to a predicted munition firing distance.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the virtual mapping of the deployment location includes a representation of a detected threat within the deployment location.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein the virtual mapping of the deployment location includes visual prompts representing information relating to one or more users of firearms, a detected threat, or both.
13. The system of claim 1, wherein the virtual mapping of the deployment location includes a legend of icons represented within an updated graphical user interface, the icons corresponding to a user of the firearm, a detected threat, or both.
14. A method for weapon monitoring and action tagging, the method comprising: storing a defined weapon action, wherein the defined weapon action is defined based on an inertial measurement from a weapon, the inertial measurement data indicative of at least one of a movement of the weapon, an orientation of the weapon, or a direction of the weapon; receiving sensor information from a weapon, wherein the sensor information includes inertial measurement data; evaluating the sensor information to determine the presence of the defined weapon action; and displaying, in response to determining that the defined weapon action occurred, indicia communicating the occurrence of the defined weapon action to a viewer via a graphical interface.
15. The system of claim 1, wherein the weapon is at least one tear gas canister.
16. The system of claim 1, wherein the weapon is at least one flash grenade.
17. The system of claim 1, wherein the weapon is at least one smoke grenade.
18. The system of claim 1, wherein the weapon is at least one non-lethal firearm projectile.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein the at least one non-lethal firearm projectile is a rubber bullet.
20. The system of claim 1, wherein the weapon is an explosive ordinance.
