</title>

<abstract>
A computing system may include persistent storage and a software application. The persistent storage may contain (i) pre-defined conversation flows respectively corresponding to conversation topics and (ii) pre-defined mappings that respectively associate the conversation topics to conversational expression(s) with matching semantic meanings. The software application may be configured to: (i) receive, from a computing device and by way of a virtual agent interface, a conversational expression; (ii) based on the pre-defined mappings, determine a particular conversation topic associated with a particular conversational expression, the particular conversational expression having a matching sematic meaning that is within a similarity threshold of a semantic meaning of the received conversational expression; and (iii) in response to determining the particular conversation topic, carry out, by way of the virtual agent interface, a particular conversation flow of the pre-defined conversation flows that corresponds to the particular conversation topic.
