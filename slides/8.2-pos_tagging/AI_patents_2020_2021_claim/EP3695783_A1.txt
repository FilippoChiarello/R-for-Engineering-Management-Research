</title>

<abstract>
Methods, apparatus and systems for wireless gait recognition are described. In one example, a described system comprises: a transmitter, a receiver, and a processor.

The receiver is configured for: receiving a second wireless signal through the wireless multipath channel between the transmitter and the receiver. The second wireless signal differs from the first wireless signal due to the wireless multipath channel which is impacted by a rhythmic motion of the object. The processor is configured for: obtaining a time series of channel information (CI) of the wireless multipath channel based on the second wireless signal, monitoring the rhythmic motion of the object based on the time series of CI (TSCI), and triggering a response action based on a result of the monitoring.
