Maintenance support device and maintenance support system for factory equipment
</title>

<abstract>
A maintenance support device includes: an image analysis unit configured to extract information indicating an operational state of a piece of factory equipment, based on a real image acquired by an image capture unit of a head-mounted display including a display unit and an image capture unit configured to acquire a real image; a data storage unit configured to store the information indicating the operational state; a data analysis unit configured to determine whether or not an abnormality has occurred in a piece of factory equipment, based on the stored information indicating the operational state; and a display control unit to cause the display unit to display the augmented reality image in which an additional image is superimposed on the real scene, the additional image indicating maintenance information for the piece of factory equipment with respect to which the data analysis unit has determined that an abnormality has occurred.

<claims>
1. A maintenance support device, comprising: an image analysis unit configured to extract information indicating an operational state of a piece of factory equipment, by detecting character regions and image regions in a real image captured by an image capture unit of a head-mounted display comprising a display unit configured to display an augmented reality image in which an additional image is superimposed on a real scene and the image capture unit configured to capture the real scene to acquire the real image, taking out characters from the character regions, and recognizing image patterns in the image regions; a data storage unit configured to store the information indicating the operational state extracted by the image analysis unit; a data analysis unit configured to determine whether or not an abnormality has occurred in the piece of factory equipment, based on the information indicating the operational state stored in the data storage unit; and a display control unit configured to cause the display unit of the head-mounted display to display the augmented reality image in which the additional image is superimposed on the real scene, the additional image indicating maintenance information for the piece of factory equipment with respect to which the data analysis unit has determined that the abnormality has occurred, wherein the data analysis unit is configured to determine that the abnormality has occurred, in response to a difference between (i) a first change in the information indicating the operational state during a first time period and (ii) a second change in the information indicating the operational state during a second time period preceding the first time period being out of a predetermined range of difference, and determine that the abnormality has not occurred, in response to the difference between (i) the first change and (ii) the second change being within the predetermined range of difference, and the maintenance information for the piece of factory equipment is information on maintenance including at least one of replacing a component constituting a device, replacing tools, replacing provisions, replenishing consumables, changing design, emergency stop of a device or manufacturing line including the device, shutting down power supply, diversion operation, relocating devices and products, removing alien objects, adding to raw materials, adjusting temperature, adjusting humidity, adjusting atmospheric pressure, and cleaning.
2. The maintenance support device according to claim 1, wherein the image analysis unit is configured to extract information on identity of the piece of factory equipment corresponding to the information indicating the operational state, based on the real image acquired by the image capture unit of the head-mounted display, wherein the data storage unit is configured to store the information indicating the operational state extracted by the image analysis unit in association with the information on the identity, and wherein the data analysis unit is configured to determine whether or not the abnormality has occurred in the piece of factory equipment that the information on the identity concerns, based on the information indicating the operational state and the information on the identity stored in the data storage unit.
3. The maintenance support device according to claim 1, wherein the display control unit is configured to cause the display unit of the head-mounted display to display the augmented reality image in which the additional image indicating the maintenance information is superimposed on the real scene near the piece of factory equipment in response to a determination that the abnormality has occurred.
4. The maintenance support device according to claim 1, wherein the image analysis unit is configured to extract the information indicating the operational state from an item displayed on a display device provided for the piece of factory equipment, the item appearing in the real image acquired by the image capture unit of the head-mounted display.
5. The maintenance support device according to claim 1, wherein the piece of factory equipment is a manufacturing machine.
6. The maintenance support device according to claim 1, wherein the piece of factory equipment is a provision for a factory.
7. A maintenance support system, comprising: a head-mounted display comprising a display unit configured to display an augmented reality image in which an additional image is superimposed on a real scene, an image capture unit configured to capture the real scene to acquire a real image, a communication unit configured to communicate with a peripheral device, and a mounting unit configured to detachably mount the head-mounted display on a user; and a maintenance support device comprising an image analysis unit configured to extract information indicating an operational state of a piece of factory equipment, by detecting character regions and image regions in the real image captured by the image capture unit of the head-mounted display, taking out characters from the character regions, and recognizing image patterns in the image regions, a data storage unit configured to store the information indicating the operational state extracted by the image analysis unit, a data analysis unit configured to determine whether or not an abnormality has occurred in the piece of factory equipment, based on the information indicating the operational state stored in the data storage unit, and a display control unit configured to cause the display unit of the head-mounted display to display the augmented reality image in which the additional image is superimposed on the real scene, the additional image indicating maintenance information for the piece of factory equipment with respect to which the data analysis unit has determined that the abnormality has occurred, wherein the data analysis unit is configured to determine that the abnormality has occurred, in response to a difference between (i) a first change in the information indicating the operational state during a first time period and (ii) a second change in the information indicating the operational state during a second time period preceding the first time period being out of a predetermined range of difference, and determine that the abnormality has not occurred, in response to the difference between (i) the first change and (ii) the second change being within the predetermined range of difference, and the maintenance information for the piece of factory equipment is information on maintenance including at least one of replacing a component constituting a device, replacing tools, replacing provisions, replenishing consumables, changing design, emergency stop of a device or manufacturing line including the device, shutting down power supply, diversion operation, relocating devices and products, removing alien objects, adding to raw materials, adjusting temperature, adjusting humidity, adjusting atmospheric pressure, and cleaning.
8. The maintenance support system according to claim 7, wherein the head-mounted display further comprises a position information acquisition unit configured to acquire position information of the head-mounted display by using the Global Positioning System.
9. The maintenance support system according to claim 7, wherein the display unit is a see-through display configured to display the augmented reality image in which the additional image is superimposed on the real scene.
10. The maintenance support system according to claim 7, wherein the display unit is configured to display the augmented reality image in which the additional image is superimposed on the real image acquired by the image capture unit.
