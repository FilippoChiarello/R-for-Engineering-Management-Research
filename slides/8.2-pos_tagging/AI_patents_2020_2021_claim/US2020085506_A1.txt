POSITION DETECTION BASED ON TISSUE DISCRIMINATION
</title>

<abstract>
A system is suggested comprising an optical sensing means and a processing unit. The optical sensing means may include an optical guide with a distal end, wherein the optical guide may be configured to be arranged in a device to be inserted into tissue in a region of interest. The processing unit may be configured to receive information of a region of interest including different tissue types as well as of a path through the tissues, to determine a sequence of tissue types along the path, to determine a tissue type at the distal end of the optical guide based on information received from the optical sensing means, to compare the determined tissue type with the tissue types on the path, to determine possible positions of the distal end of the optical guide on the path based on the comparison of tissue types, and to generate a signal indicative for the possible positions.

<claims>
1. A system for determining a position of a device insertable into tissue, comprising an optical sensing device including an optical guide with a distal end, the optical guide being arrangable within the insertable device, and a processing unit, wherein the processing unit is configured (i) to receive tissue type information of a region of interest including different tissue types, (ii) to receive an input identifying a path through the region of interest, (iii) to determine a sequence of tissue types along the identified path, based on the received tissue type information (iv) to receive optical information from the optical sensing device (v) to determine a tissue type at the distal end of the optical guide based on the received optical information, (vi) to compare the determined tissue type with the sequence of tissue types along the path, (vii) to determine possible positions of the distal end of the optical guide on the path based on the comparison of the tissue types, and (viii) to generate a signal indicative for a mismatch between the determination tissue type based on the received optical information and the possible tissue types for the possible positions along the path through the region of interest.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising a tracking device for tracking a position of the distal end of the optical guide relative to the region of interest, wherein determination of the possible positions is further based on the tracked position.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the tracking device comprises elements for EM tracking, optical tracking and/or shape sensing.
4. (canceled)
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the processing unit is further configured to generate a visualization of the region of interest together with a virtual representation of the device to be inserted, in the region of interest, wherein the distal end of the virtual representation of the device is shown at the most probable position on the path.
6. The system of claim 1, further comprising a video camera for imaging an operation field including the region of interest, wherein the processing unit is further configured to generate a combined visualization of the operation field and of inner structures of the region of interest.
7. The system of claim 1, further comprising an imaging system for generating information of a region of interest including different tissue types, wherein the imaging system is a medical imaging system out of the group consisting of an X-ray imaging system, an MR imaging system, a CT imaging system, and an ultrasound imaging system.
8. The system of claim 2, further comprising an instrument for inserting the device into the tissue, wherein a position and orientation of the instrument is traceable by the tracking device, and wherein the generated visualization includes an indication of a relation of the instrument to the region of interest.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the device being insertable into a tissue is a device out of the group consisting of a screw, a K-wire, an awl and a tap.
10. A method of determining a position of a device insertable into tissue, the method comprising the steps of: Receiving tissue type information of a region of interest including different tissue types and an input identifying a path through the region of interest determining a sequence of tissue types along a path identified in a region of interest, determining a tissue type at a distal end of an optical guide based on optical information, comparing the determined tissue type with the tissue types on the path, determining possible positions of the distal end of the optical guide on the path, and Indicating a mismatch between the determined tissue type at the distal end and tissue types from the sequence of tissue types corresponding to the possible positions along the path through the region of interest.
11. (canceled)
12. The method of claim 10, further comprising the step of generating a visualization of the region of interest together with a virtual representation of an insertable device, in the region of interest, wherein the distal end of the virtual representation of the insertable device is shown at the most probable position on the path.
13. A computer program product comprising sets of instruction which, when executed on a processing unit of a system for determining a position of a device insertable into tissue according to claim 1 cause the processing unit to: (i) to receive tissue type information of a region of interest including different tissue types, (ii) to receive an input identifying a path through the region of interest, (iii) to determine a sequence of tissue types along the identified path, based on the received tissue type information (iv) to receive optical information from the optical sensing device, (v) to determine a tissue type at the distal end of the optical guide based on the received optical information, (vi) to compare the determined tissue type with the sequence of tissue types along the path, (vii) to determine possible positions of the distal end of the optical guide on the path based on the comparison of the tissue types, and (viii) to generate a signal indicative for a mismatch between the determination tissue type based on the received optical information and the possible tissue types for the possible positions along the path through the region of interest.
