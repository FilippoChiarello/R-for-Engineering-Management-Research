2. The communications method of claim 1, wherein the first call includes first call signaling and first call media; and wherein said determining whether or not said first call originated from an artificial intelligence system is based on one or more of the following: (i) an explicit indicator included in said first call signaling that said first call originated from an artificial intelligence device, and (ii) an indicator included in said first call media that said first call originated from an artificial intelligence system.
3. The communications method of claim 1, wherein determining whether or not said first call originated from said artificial intelligence system includes one or more of the following: determining if an explicit artificial intelligence indicator indicating that the first call originated from an artificial intelligence system is present in said first call signaling; and determining if an explicit or implicit artificial intelligence indicator indicating that the first call originated from an artificial intelligence system is present in said first call media.
4. The communications method of claim 3, wherein said determining if an explicit or implicit artificial intelligence indicator indicating that the first call originated from an artificial intelligence system is present in said first call media includes: processing at least a portion of an audio signal of the first call to determine if the audio signal includes an explicit or implicit artificial intelligence indicator indicating the first call originated from an artificial intelligence system; and processing at least a portion of a video signal of the first call to determine if the video signal includes an explicit or implicit artificial intelligence indicator indicating the first call originated from an artificial intelligence system.
5. The communications method of claim 3, further comprising: when an explicit artificial intelligence indicator is detected in said first call, checking whether said detected explicit artificial intelligence indicator indicates the first call originated from an artificial intelligence system; and when said explicit artificial intelligence indicator is not detected in said first call, determining that the first call did not originate from an artificial intelligence system.
6. The communications method of claim 4, wherein said processing at least a portion of the audio signal of the first call to determine if the audio signal includes an explicit artificial intelligence indicator indicating the first call originated from an artificial intelligence system includes determining whether the at least a portion of the audio signal of the first call includes a fixed tone, tone pattern or speech announcement indicating that the first call originated from an artificial intelligence system.
7. The communications method of claim 6 further comprising: determining that the first call originated from an artificial intelligence system upon determining that the at least a portion of the audio signal of the first call does include a fixed tone, tone pattern or speech announcement indicating that the first call originated from an artificial intelligence system.
8. The communication method of claim 6, wherein said processing at least a portion of the video signal of the first call to determine if the video signal includes an explicit indicator indicating the first call is from an artificial intelligence system includes determining whether the at least a portion of the video signal of the first call includes text, a control signal, an image, or a set of images that indicates the first call originated from an artificial intelligence system.
9. The communications method of claim 1, further comprising: when said first call is determined not to have originated from an artificial intelligence system performing a call handling operation on said first call different than said artificial intelligence call handling operations.
10. The communications method of claim 1, wherein when said first call is determined to have originated from an artificial intelligence system performing artificial intelligence call handling operations includes performing one or more of the following: placing said first call in a call waiting queue behind non-artificial intelligence originated identified calls; instructing the artificial intelligence system that originated the first call to call back at a different time via signaling inserted into the signaling or media path of the first call; instructing the artificial intelligence system that originated the first call to call back to a different telephone number via signaling inserted into the signaling or media path of the first call; redirecting or transferring the first call to a voice messaging system to record a message; redirecting or transferring the first call to an interactive voice response system that will acquire the artificial intelligence's contact information to contact the artificial intelligence at a future time; blocking the first call; rejecting the first call; or instructing the artificial intelligence system that originated the first call to contact a web service system, contact information of said web service system being included in a signaling response or media response to said first call.
11. The communications method of claim 10, wherein said first call is received by a network equipment device; and wherein the artificial intelligence call handling operations to be performed are determined based on an artificial intelligence call handling operation network policy when said network equipment device determines that said first call originated from an artificial intelligence system.
12. The communications method of claim 1, wherein said first call is received by a first device from an originating system, said first call being destined for a second device, said first device being located in the signaling and media path between the originating system and the second device; and wherein performing artificial intelligence call handling operations includes: modifying said first call to include one or more artificial intelligence indicators in said signaling or said media of said first call, said one or more artificial intelligence indicators being artificial intelligence indicators not included in said first call; and transmitting said modified first call to said second device.
13. A communications method comprising: receiving at a first device a first call destined for a second device; determining whether said first call includes first information identifying said first call as originating from an artificial intelligence system; and when the first device determines that the first call includes first information identifying said first call as originating from an artificial intelligence system: (i) modifying by the first device at least one of said signaling of the first call or media of the first call to include second information identifying said first call as originating from an artificial intelligence system, said second information being different from said first information, and (ii) transmitting the modified first call to the second device.
14. The communications method of claim 13, further comprising: when the first device determines that the first call does not include said first information identifying said first call as originating from an artificial intelligence system: (i) modifying by the first device the first call to include second information identifying said first call as not originating from an artificial intelligence system, and (ii) transmitting by the first device the modified first call to the second device.
15. A communications system comprising: a communications device including a processor, said processor controlling the operation of the communications device to: receive a first call; determine whether said first call originated from an artificial intelligence system; and when said first call is determined to have originated from an artificial intelligence system perform one or more artificial intelligence call handling operations.
16. The communications system of claim 15, wherein said first call includes first call signaling and first call media; and wherein said operation to determine whether or not said first call originated from an artificial intelligence system is based on one or more of the following: (i) an explicit indicator included in said first call signaling that said first call originated from an artificial intelligence device, and (ii) an indicator included in said first call media that said first call originated from an artificial intelligence system.
17. The communications system of claim 15, wherein said operation to determine whether or not said first call originated from said artificial intelligence system includes one or more of the following: determining if an explicit artificial intelligence indicator indicating that the first call originated from an artificial intelligence system is present in said first call signaling; and determining if an explicit or implicit artificial intelligence indicator indicating that the first call originated from an artificial intelligence system is present in said first call media.
18.
