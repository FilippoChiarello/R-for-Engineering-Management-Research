A METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DETECTION OF NATURAL DISASTER OCCURRENCE
</title>

<abstract>
A system (100) and method to detect an occurrence of a natural disaster comprises of a real time visioning analytic module (110) and a sensor analyser module (120), configured to collect real time data and sensing data on the natural disaster from a target area and from areas surrounding the target area; and an information collector and analyser module (130), configured to collect data related to the natural disaster occurrence in the target area and the areas surrounding the target area from a plurality of data sources. The system (100) further comprises a deep learning analytic module (140), configured to retrieve and process the collected data for determining a natural disaster score on the occurrence of the natural disaster in the target area and the areas surrounding the target area.

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method for detecting an occurrence of a natural disaster, the method comprising the steps of:
collecting, by a real time visioning analytic module (110) and a sensor analyser module (120), real time data and sensing data related to the natural disaster from a target area and from areas surrounding the target area;
collecting, by an information collector and analyser module (130), data related to the natural disaster occurred in the target area and the areas surrounding the target area from a plurality of data sources, wherein the data sources include data from a web media, data from a national weather department, data from a national irrigation and drainage department and historical data; and
retrieving and processing, by a deep learning analytic module (140), all the collected data, characterised in that processing of the collected data comprises the steps of:
assigning a value to each of the retrieved data from the real time visioning analytic module (110), the sensor analyser module (120) and the information collector and analyser module (130) based on the occurrence of the natural disaster;
computing a first score by averaging the assigned values of the data retrieved from the information collector and analyser module (130), whereby the first score indicates whether the natural disaster has occurred in the areas surrounding the target area; and
computing a natural disaster score by summing the first score and the assigned values of the data retrieved from the real time visioning analytic module (110) and from the sensor analyser module (120), whereby if the natural disaster score is greater than a pre determined value, it indicates the natural disaster has occurred in the target area and if the natural disaster score is less or equal to the pre determined value, it indicates the natural disaster has not occurred in the target area.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the steps of collecting real time data related to the natural disaster by the real time visioning analytic module (110) includes:
capturing an image of the target area and the areas surrounding the target area; and
analysing the captured image in every predetermined time interval, for monitoring whether the natural disaster has occurred in the target area. 3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the steps of collecting the sensing data related to the natural disaster by the sensor analyser module (120) includes:
retrieving the sensing data of the environment in the target area and the areas surrounding the target area; and
analysing the retrieved data in every predetermined time interval for detecting changes in the retrieved data.
4. The method according to claim 2, wherein the steps of analysing the captured image by the real time visioning analytic module (110) comprises the steps of: translating basic shape of the captured image into an ontology based image, wherein the ontology based image is represented by a series of color codes with different percentage;
extracting the color code used in the ontology based image; sorting the color code based on its percentage;
comparing the ontology based image with the captured image; and determining if there is a significant change in the basic shape and the color code percentage in the image based on the comparison result.
5. The method according to claim 1, further comprises the steps of:
retrieving, by the deep learning analytic module (140), location details of the target area and the areas surrounding the target area, from a location service provider module; calculating, by the deep learning analytic module (140), distance between the target area and the areas surrounding the target area based on the analysis of the natural disaster occurrence; and
averaging, by the deep learning analytic module (140), the calculated distance, for determining distance of the areas affected by the natural disaster surrounding the target area.
6. The method according to claim 1, further comprises the steps of:
broadcasting a low alert signal, by the output module (150), along with the calculated distance of the areas affected due to the natural disaster surrounding the target area, if the natural disaster score is less than or equal to one, wherein this condition indicates the natural disaster is about to occur in the target area; and
broadcasting a high alert signal, by the output module (150), if the natural disaster score is greater than one, wherein this condition indicates the natural disaster has occurred in the target area.
7. A system (100) for detecting an occurrence of natural disaster comprising:
a real time visioning analytic module (110) configured to collect real time data related to the natural disaster from a target area and from areas surrounding the target area;
a sensor analyser module (120) configured to collect real time sensing data on the natural disaster from the target area and from the areas surrounding the target area;

a deep learning analytic module (140) configured to retrieve and process all the collected data, characterised in that the deep learning analytic module (140) configured to: assigns a value to each of the retrieved data from the real time visioning analytic module (110), the sensor analyser module (120) and the information collector and analyser module (130) based on the occurrence of the natural disaster;
computes a first score by averaging the assigned values of the data retrieved from the information collector and analyser module (130), whereby the first score indicates whether the natural disaster has occurred in the areas surrounding the target area; and
computes a natural disaster score by summing the first score and the assigned values of the data retrieved from the real time visioning analytic module (110) and from the sensor analyser module (120), whereby if the natural disaster score is greater than a pre determined value it indicates the natural disaster has occurred in the target area and if the natural disaster score is less than or equal to the pre-determined value, it indicates the natural disaster has not occurred in the target area.
8. The system (100) according to claim 7, wherein the real time visioning analytic module (110) is further configured to capture an image of the target area and the areas surrounding the target area and analyse the captured image in every predetermined time interval, to monitor whether the natural disaster has occurred in the target area. 9.
