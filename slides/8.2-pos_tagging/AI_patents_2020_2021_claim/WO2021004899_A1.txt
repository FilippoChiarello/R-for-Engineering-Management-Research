<title>
A COOKING DEVICE AND COOKING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A cooking device is for cooking food on a support (e.g. in a basket) within a cooking chamber. Cooking parameters are sensed over time so that a required cooking time can be determined. An intervention made by a user to the food is sensed during cooking, such as shaking the basket. The required cooking time is then re-determined. In this way, the cooking time remains accurate both for an intervention or no intervention. This may for example enable the user to be given more accurate information about when the cooking process will be complete.

<claims>
1. A cooking device (1), comprising:
a cooking chamber (2);
a food support (10) for supporting the food to be cooked, for mounting in the cooking chamber;
a heating device (18) for heating the cooking chamber;
a sensing arrangement (30a, 30b, 30c, 30d, 30e) for sensing cooking parameters over time;
a controller (32) adapted to determine a required cooking time for the food to be cooked and hence the cooking process to be complete based on the time-evolution of the sensed cooking parameters; and
a sensor (50) for sensing an intervention made by a user to the food during cooking and hence before the required cooking time has elapsed,
wherein the controller (32) is adapted to re-determine and thereby adjust the required cooking time, based on the time-evolution of the sensed cooking parameters, in response to, and following, a sensed intervention.
2. A cooking device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the food is to be cooked by a cooking procedure which includes shaking the food during the cooking process, wherein the sensed intervention is indicative of shaking of the food.
3. A cooking device as claimed in claim 1 or 2 comprising an air fryer.
4. A cooking device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, comprising an output device (34) for providing one or both of:
an output instruction to a user to perform the intervention at a particular time; and
an indication of the remaining required cooking time.
5. A cooking device as claimed in claim 4, wherein the controller (32) is adapted to set the particular time as a time point between one third and two thirds of the way through the determined required cooking time.
6. A cooking device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the sensing arrangement comprises a temperature sensor (30a) and/or a humidity sensor (30b).
7. A cooking device as claimed in claim 6, wherein the controller is adapted to determine a required time for the intervention by monitoring the temperature, and optionally wherein the temperature sensor functions as the sensor for sensing an intervention based on a drop in temperature caused by the cooking chamber being opened.
8. A cooking device as claimed in claim 6 or 7, wherein the controller is adapted to determine a required time for the intervention by monitoring the humidity, and optionally wherein the humidity sensor functions as the sensor for sensing an intervention based on a drop in humidity caused by the cooking chamber being opened.
9. A cooking device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the sensing arrangement comprising a weight sensor (30c, 30e), and wherein the controller is adapted to determine a required cooking time by monitoring the weight change.
10. A cooking device as claimed in claim 9, wherein the controller is adapted to determine a required time for the intervention by monitoring the weight change, and optionally wherein the weight sensor functions as the sensor for sensing an intervention based on a drop in weight caused by the removal of the food from the cooking chamber during the intervention.
11. A cooking device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, wherein the sensing arrangement comprises an image sensor (30d), and wherein the controller is adapted to determine a required cooking time by monitoring an image of the food.
12. A cooking device as claimed in claim 11, wherein the controller is adapted to determine a required time for the intervention by monitoring the image of the food and optionally wherein the image sensor functions as the sensor for sensing an intervention based on an image change caused by the removal of the food from the cooking chamber.
13. A cooking method, comprising:
(70) determining a required cooking time for food to be cooked, and hence the cooking method to be complete, based on the evolution of sensed cooking parameters over time;
(72) sensing an intervention made by a user to the food during cooking and hence before the required cooking time has elapsed; and
(74) re-determining and thereby adjusting the required cooking time, based on the evolution of sensed cooking parameters over time, in response to a sensed intervention.
14. A method as claimed in claim 13, further comprising:
(71) determining a required time for the intervention and outputting advisory information to a user.
15. A computer program comprising code means which is adapted, when run on the cooking device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12, to perform the steps of claim 13 or 14.
