Hybrid satellite communication system for cockpit, cabin, and crew connectivity
</title>

<abstract>
A hybrid satellite communication system for cockpit, cabin, and crew connectivity includes a hybrid antenna mountable on an exterior surface of an aircraft. The hybrid antenna includes an L-band antenna. The hybrid antenna includes a high-throughput antenna configured to operate on at least one of a ku-band or a ka-band. The hybrid satellite communication system includes a multi-constellation modem manager in communication with the hybrid antenna. The multi-constellation modem manager includes an L-band antenna modem card configured to communicate with the L-band antenna. The multi-constellation modem manager includes a high-throughput modem card configured to communicate with the high-throughput antenna. The multi-constellation modem manager is configured for simultaneous operation on multiple satellite constellations by simultaneously communicating via the L-band antenna and the high-throughput antenna.

<claims>
1. A hybrid satellite communication system for cockpit, cabin, and crew connectivity, comprising: a hybrid antenna mountable on an exterior surface of an aircraft, the hybrid antenna comprising: an L-band antenna; and a high-throughput antenna configured to operate on at least one of a ku-band or a ka-band; and a multi-constellation modem manager in communication with the hybrid antenna, the multi-constellation modem manager comprising: an L-band antenna modem card configured to communicate with the L-band antenna; and a high-throughput modem card configured to communicate with the high-throughput antenna, the multi-constellation modem manager being configured for simultaneous operation on multiple satellite constellations by simultaneously communicating via the L-band antenna and the high-throughput antenna.
2. The hybrid satellite communication system of claim 1, the L-band antenna and the high-throughput antenna being positioned underneath a radome, the positioning dependent on a spacing selected to prevent the L-band antenna and the high-throughput antenna from jamming.
3. The hybrid satellite communication system of claim 1, the hybrid antenna being dimensioned to fit within a footprint defined by an ARINC-781 standard.
4. The hybrid satellite communication system of claim 1, the hybrid antenna being dimensioned to fit within a footprint defined by an ARINC-792 standard.
5. The hybrid satellite communication system of claim 1, the L-band antenna being a low-gain antenna.
6. The hybrid satellite communication system of claim 1, the L-band antenna being a high-gain antenna.
7. The hybrid satellite communication system of claim 1, the hybrid antenna being in a low earth orbit (LEO)-low earth orbit (LEO) configuration.
8. The hybrid satellite communication system of claim 7, the high-throughput antenna of the low earth orbit (LEO)-low earth orbit (LEO) configuration including a full-duplex transmitter array and a full-duplex receiver array, the full-duplex transmitter array and the full-duplex receiver array being configured to operate simultaneously.
9. The hybrid satellite communication system of claim 7, the high-throughput antenna of the low earth orbit (LEO)-low earth orbit (LEO) configuration including a transmission/receiver half-duplex array, the transmission/receiver half-duplex array being configured to switch between and operate either a transmitting channel or a receiving channel at a particular time.
10. The hybrid satellite communication system of claim 1, the hybrid antenna being in a low earth orbit (LEO)-geostationary earth orbit (GEO) configuration.
11. The hybrid satellite communication system of claim 10, the high-throughput antenna of the low earth orbit (LEO)-geostationary earth orbit (GEO) configuration including a full-duplex transmitter array and a full-duplex receiver array, the full-duplex transmitter array and the full-duplex receiver array being configured to operate simultaneously.
12. The hybrid satellite communication system of claim 1, the multi-constellation modem manager being configured to receive data from an aircraft sensor of the aircraft on which the hybrid antenna is mounted.
13. The hybrid satellite communication system of claim 1, the multi-constellation modem manager being configured to receive data from an aircraft component of the aircraft on which the hybrid antenna is mounted.
14. The hybrid satellite communication system of claim 1, the multi-constellation modem manager being configured to receive data or transmit data from an aircraft performance module.
15. A hybrid antenna of a hybrid satellite communication system for cockpit, cabin, and crew connectivity, the hybrid antenna mountable on an exterior surface of an aircraft, the hybrid antenna comprising: an L-band antenna configured to communicate with an L-band antenna modem card of a multi-constellation modem manager; and a high-throughput antenna configured to operate on at least one of a ku-band or a ka-band, the high-throughput antenna configured to communicate with a high-throughput modem card of the multi-constellation modem manager, the multi-constellation modem manager being configured for simultaneous operation on multiple satellite constellations by simultaneously communicating via the L-band antenna and the high-throughput antenna.
