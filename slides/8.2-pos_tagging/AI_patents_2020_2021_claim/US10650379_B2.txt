<title>
Method and system for validating personalized account identifiers using biometric authentication and self-learning algorithms
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a system and method for biometric authentication of a user using a personalised identification and associated biometric data. In one embodiment, a plurality of personalised identifiers and biometric data may be captured from a number of users and stored in a repository as stored records. The authentication process may be divided into two phases. In the first phase, either a speech recognition or character recognition process may be applied in order to determine the text spoken or written by the user. Subsequently a few records may be fetched from the repository on the basis of text mapping. In the second phase, biometric authentication may be performed by comparing the biometric sample with the stored biometric data corresponding to the fetched records to uniquely identify a single user. Further a machine learning technique may be applied in order to periodically refine a plurality of models stored in the repository.

4. The method of claim 3, wherein the at least one personalized identifier is capable of being either written or spoken, and capable of being transformed from either image to text or speech to text, respectively.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the captured personalized identifier is converted into the one or more text-scripts using speech-to-text conversion or Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the text is converted into a hash-code or Unicode data format of standard data size.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one personalized identifier is captured in the form of a non-transcriptable sounds, and is correlated with stored text after removing and suppressing the non-transcriptable sounds.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the matching of the one or more text-scripts with the text is performed using at least one algorithm selected from a group comprising: a semantic string matching, an approximate string matching, a fuzzy string matching, and combinations thereof.
