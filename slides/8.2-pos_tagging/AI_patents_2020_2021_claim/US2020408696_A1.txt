METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CHECKING THE PRODUCTION QUALITY OF CABLES THAT ARE PROVIDED WITH A PROTECTIVE SHEATH, IN PARTICULAR ELECTRICAL CABLES
</title>

<claims>
1. A method for checking the production quality of a cable that is provided with a protective sheath comprising the steps of: acquiring images of an external surface of said cable by way of one or more digital video cameras, while said cable is moved along an advancement axis; and processing said images by way of one or more algorithms in order to calculate one or more numeric indices, each numeric index of the one or more numeric indices is proportional to a respective optically-detectable characteristic of said external surface of said cable.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein said images are processed by way of a first algorithm to calculate a numeric color index proportional to the color difference between a color of said external surface and a predetermined reference color.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein said numeric color index is defined as the Euclidean distance between a set of three cylindrical coordinates of a main color of at least one of the acquired images and a set of three cylindrical coordinates of the reference color; each cylindrical coordinate of said sets of three cylindrical coordinates comprising a first coordinate constituted by the wavelength value of the color, a second coordinate constituted by the saturation value of the color, and a third coordinate constituted by the lightness value of the color.
4. The method according to claim 2, wherein said images are processed by way of a second algorithm to calculate a numeric roughness index proportional to a roughness of said external surface.
5. The method according to claim 4, wherein said numeric roughness index is calculated by carrying out at least the following steps of: a. converting said image to grayscale; b. selecting at least one delimited region of interest of said image; and c. processing said region of interest by way of a convolutional neural network which has previously been trained to return a numeric roughness index that is proportional to the roughness of the surface.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein each numeric index of said one or more numeric indices is compared with a respective threshold value, and if one numeric index of said one or more numeric indices is greater than said respective threshold value, then an alarm signal is produced.
7. An apparatus for checking the production quality of a cable that is provided with a sheath, comprising at least one digital video camera aimed at an advancement axis of said cable, said at least one digital video camera is configured to acquire images of the external surface of said cable and is functionally connected to an electronic processing unit which is configured to process said images by way of one or more algorithms in order to calculate one or more numeric indices, each numeric index is proportional to a respective optically-detectable characteristic of said external surface of said cable.
8. The apparatus according to claim 7, wherein said electronic processing unit is functionally connected to at least one alarm or interface device configured to provide at least one message or signal as a function of said at least one numeric index.
9. The apparatus according to claim 7, further comprising three digital video cameras arranged in a radial configuration around said advancement axis of said cable.
10. The apparatus according to claim 7, further comprising at least one light source configured to emit an incident light on said external surface of said cable so as to illuminate at least one region of said external surface of said cable which is targeted by said at least one digital video camera.
11. The apparatus according to claim 7, comprising: a protective containment body which defines internally a working volume which contains said at least one digital video camera and is adapted to contain, during operation, at least one portion of said cable which comprises a region of said external surface which is targeted by said at least one digital video camera; and a source of compressed gas configured to introduce a pressurized gas into said working volume.
