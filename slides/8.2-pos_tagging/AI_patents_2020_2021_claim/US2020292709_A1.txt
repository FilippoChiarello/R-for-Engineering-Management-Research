POLYGON MIRROR AND MEMS INTERCONNECT WITH MULTIPLE TURNS
</title>

<abstract>
In some embodiments, a LIDAR system may include at least one processor configured to control at least one light source for projecting light toward a field of view and receive from at least one first sensor first signals associated with light projected by the at least one light source and reflected from an object in the field of view, wherein the light impinging on the at least one first sensor is in a form of a light spot having an outer boundary. The processor may further be configured to receive from at least one second sensor second signals associated with light noise, wherein the at least one second sensor is located outside the outer boundary; determine, based on the second signals received from the at least one second sensor, an indicator of a magnitude of the light noise; and determine, based on the indicator the first signals received from the at least one first sensor and, a distance to the object.

1. 1.-176. (canceled)
177. A MEMS scanning device, comprising: a movable MEMS mirror configured to pivot about at least one axis; at least one actuator operable to rotate the MEMS mirror about the at least one axis, each actuator out of the at least one actuator operable to bend upon actuation to move the MEMS mirror; and at least one flexible interconnect element coupled between the at least one actuator and the MEMS mirror for transferring a pulling force of the bending of the at least one actuator to the MEMS mirror; wherein each flexible interconnect element out of the at least one interconnect element is an elongated structure comprising at least two turns at opposing directions, each turn greater than 120Â°.
178. The MEMS scanning device according to claim 177, comprising: a plurality of actuators which are a plurality of piezoelectric actuators operable to rotate the MEMS mirror about the at least one axis, each piezoelectric actuator comprising a body and a piezoelectric element that is configured to bend the body and move the MEMS mirror when subjected to an electrical field; and a plurality of flexible interconnect elements, each comprising a substantially straight portion substantially perpendicular to an edge of the MEMS mirror; wherein a bent part of the flexible interconnect which comprises the at least two opposing turns has an accumulated width that is shorter than the elongated part; wherein each of the plurality of flexible interconnect elements is narrower than an actuator out of the plurality of actuators two which the respective flexible interconnect element is coupled.
179. A polygon scanner assembly, the polygon scanner assembly comprising: an at least-partly transparent tank; an at least-partly transparent fluid, confined within the tank; and a reflective polygon, at least partly immersed in the fluid, the reflective polygon operable to reflect an incidence beam of light arriving from outside the tank to provide a deflected beam of light exiting from the tank outward; wherein a shape of an exterior wall of the tank is not parallel to a shape of an interior wall of the wall in at least a transference part of the wall of the tank through which at least one of the incidence beam and the deflected beam propagates.
180. The polygon scanner assembly according to claim 179, wherein the fluid is a liquid, wherein the exterior of the transference part includes at least one flat facet, while the interior of the transference part is a smoothly curved plane, wherein a divergence of a light beam scanned by the polygon scanner is substantially unchanged in a plurality of instantaneous positions of the reflective polygon.
