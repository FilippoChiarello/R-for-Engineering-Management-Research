<title>
PROVIDING RISK BASED SUBSCRIBER ENHANCEMENTS
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system may input telemetry into a data structure. The telemetry may comprise a plurality of measurement results or other data collected from remote network nodes. Subscriber use metrics may be determined from the telemetry. From the use metrics and habits of the subscriber, user characteristics may be determined. A likelihood of service cancellation, based on the user characteristics, may be estimated in an embodiment. In another embodiment, a likelihood of receiving an inquiry from the subscriber at a subscriber support center may be estimated. Service enhancements may be proactively provided to the subscriber, based on the telemetry, the subscriber use metrics and the user characteristics in advance of service cancellation or receiving the inquiry. Last mile equipment may provide telemetry. The last mile equipment may include set top boxes, cellular phones, tablets and the like.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: collecting telemetry including measurement results or other data, from remote network nodes; determining subscriber use metrics; determining user characteristics based on the subscriber use metrics and habits of the subscriber; estimating a likelihood of service cancelation or a likelihood of receiving an inquiry from the subscriber at a subscriber support center; and proactively providing service enhancements to the subscriber, based on the telemetry, the subscriber use metrics and the user characteristics in advance of service cancellation or receiving the inquiry.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein estimating the likelihood of service cancellation is performed by comparing the subscriber use metrics to user metrics of users who have canceled service.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein estimating the likelihood of service cancellation is performed via regression trees.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the telemetry includes at least one or more of: quality of service (QoS) information, quality of experience (QoE) information or viewing preferences of the subscriber.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the data structure includes at least one of: geolocation information, network location, a network type, access equipment type, service plan cost, additional purchases, history of calls to the subscriber support center, key head end (KHE) quality indicators, key operator network (KNet) quality indicators, key subscriber (KSub) quality indicators, quality monitoring system alarms, network equipment alarms from FM/PM, city/town population.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the service enhancements include providing a message to the subscriber or connecting the subscriber to a service representative.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the subscriber use metrics are determined via collecting data for a plurality of subscribers.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the estimating is performed via a machine learning model.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the machine learning model is based on arrival of new data, which causes the machine learning model to adapt to changes in taste and habits of a plurality of subscribers.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the machine learning model is a neural network based model.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein the machine learning model is a gradient boosting based model.
12. A system comprising: a data structure configured to receive telemetry, wherein the telemetry comprises a plurality of measurement results or other data collected from remote network nodes; circuitry configured to determine subscriber use metrics; the circuitry configured to determine user characteristics based on the subscriber use metrics and habits of the subscriber; the circuitry configured to estimate a likelihood of service cancelation or likelihood of receiving an inquiry from the subscriber at a subscriber support center; and a transmitter configured to provide enhanced services to the subscriber, based on the telemetry, the subscriber use metrics and the user characteristics in advance of service cancellation or receiving the inquiry.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein estimating the likelihood of service cancellation is performed by comparing the subscriber use metrics to user metrics of users who have cancelled service.
14. The system of claim 12, wherein estimating the likelihood of service cancellation is performed via regression trees.
15. The system of claim 12, wherein the telemetry includes at least one or more of: quality of service (QoS) information, quality of experience (QoE) information or viewing preferences of the subscriber.
16. The system of claim 12, wherein the data structure includes at least one of: geolocation information, network location, a network type, access equipment type, service plan cost, additional purchases, history of calls to the subscriber support center, key head end (KHE) quality indicators, key operator network (KNet) quality indicators, key subscriber (KSub) quality indicators, quality monitoring system alarms, network equipment alarms from FM/PM, city/town population.
17. The system of claim 12, wherein the service enhancements include providing a message to the subscriber or connecting the subscriber to a service representative.
18. The system of claim 12, wherein the subscriber use metrics are determined via collecting data for a plurality of subscribers.
19. The system of claim 12, wherein the estimating is performed via a machine learning model.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein the machine learning model is based on arrival of new data, which causes the machine learning model to adapt to changes in taste and habits of a plurality of subscribers.
