<title>
Detecting self-generated wake expressions
</title>

<abstract>
A speech-based audio device may be configured to detect a user-uttered wake expression. For example, the audio device may generate a parameter indicating whether output audio is currently being produced by an audio speaker, whether the output audio contains speech, whether the output audio contains a predefined expression, loudness of the output audio, loudness of input audio, and/or an echo characteristic. Based on the parameter, the audio device may determine whether an occurrence of the predefined expression in the input audio is a result of an utterance of the predefined expression by a user.
