IMAGING DISPLAY DEVICE AND ELECTRONIC DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
An imaging display device which can quickly display a captured image is provided. The imaging display device includes an imaging portion on a first surface and a display portion on a second surface that is opposite to the first surface. The imaging portion includes a photoelectric conversion element configured to receive light delivered to the first surface. The display portion includes a light-emitting element configured to emit light in a direction opposite to the first surface. A pixel in the imaging portion is electrically connected to a pixel in the display portion. An image signal obtained at the imaging portion can be directly input to the display portion. Accordingly, the time delay due to data conversion can be eliminated, so that a captured image can be displayed in a moment.
