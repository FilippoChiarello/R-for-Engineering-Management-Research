METHODS AND MATERIALS FOR GENDER-DEPENDENT TREATMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR DYSFUNCTION
</title>

<abstract>
This document provides methods and materials involved in treating cardiovascular conditions such as calcific aortic valve stenosis. For example, methods and materials for using sGC agonists or a combination of sGC agonists and PDE5A inhibitors to reduce calcification of heart valves and/or vessels or to slow progression of aortic sclerosis to calcific aortic valve stenosis are provided.
