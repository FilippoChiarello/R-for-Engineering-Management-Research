ELECTRONIC APPARATUS, METHOD FOR CONTROLLING THEREOF, AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING SERVER
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosure relates to an artificial intelligence (AI) system that uses a machine learning algorithm and an application thereof. A method for controlling an electronic apparatus according to the disclosure includes receiving image data and information associated with a filter set that is applied to an artificial intelligence model for upscaling the image data from an external server; decoding the image data; upscaling the decoded image data using a first artificial intelligence model that is obtained based on the information associated with the filter set; and providing the up scaled image data for output.

<claims>
1. A method for controlling an electronic apparatus, the method comprising: receiving image data and information associated with a filter set that is applied to an artificial intelligence model for upscaling the image data from an external server; decoding the image data; upscaling the decoded image data using a first artificial intelligence model that is obtained based on the information associated with the filter set; and providing the upscaled image data for output.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the information associated with the filter set includes index information of the filter set, and wherein the upscaling comprises: obtaining the first artificial intelligence model to which one of a plurality of trained filter sets stored in the electronic apparatus is applied based on the index information; and upscaling the decoded image data by inputting the decoded image data into the obtained first artificial intelligence model.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the image data is obtained by encoding downscaled image data acquired by inputting original image data corresponding to the image data into a second artificial intelligence model for downscaling original image data.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein a number of filters of the first artificial intelligence model is smaller than a number of filters of the second artificial intelligence model.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the information associated with the filter set is information obtained by the external server, and identifies a filter set that minimizes a difference between the upscaled image data acquired by the first artificial intelligence model and the original image data.
