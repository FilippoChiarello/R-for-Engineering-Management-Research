Methods to detect anomalies and to measure water usage in pumping plants using energy consumption data
</title>

<abstract>
Water leaks and other anomalies in irrigation systems may be detected by analysis of energy consumption data captured from a utility power meter, and particularly energy data from smart meters that service water pumps. Furthermore, water usage can be measured indirectly from the energy required to move it given an understanding of its operating condition that ties water flow and electrical power. Unlike existing solutions that use water meters or other sensors, embodiments of the present method described herein detect water leaks and other anomalies from the electrical load for the water pump(s) and track the operating condition of the pump.

1. A method of providing an automated water record for an irrigation system using ground water extraction and that includes an electrical water pump that operates using electrical energy and which is connected to an energy meter that periodically provides for a previous period of time energy usage data for the previous period of time, the method comprising the steps of: receiving and storing the energy usage data associated with the irrigation system for the previous period of time in a database; using the energy usage data for the previous period of time to estimate water usage for the previous period of time using a data processing computer system coupled to the database that operates upon the energy usage data, wherein the data processing system that operates upon the energy usage data uses an average operating condition during a time period in obtaining the water usage estimate during the same time period; and preparing the water record based upon the estimated water usage using the data processing computer system.
2. A method of providing an automated water record for an irrigation system using ground water extraction and that includes an electrical water pump that operates using electrical energy and which is connected to an energy meter that periodically provides for a previous period of time energy usage data for the previous period of time, the method comprising the steps of: receiving and storing the energy usage data associated with the irrigation system for the previous period of time in a database; using the energy usage data for the previous period of time to estimate water usage for the previous period of time using a data processing computer system coupled to the database that operates upon the energy usage data, wherein the data processing system that operates upon the energy usage data uses a polynomial decomposition of water flow according to changes in power of the water pump in obtaining the water usage estimate of a pump working away from its average operating condition; and preparing the water record based upon the estimated water usage using the data processing computer system.
3. A method of providing an automated water record for an irrigation system using ground water extraction and that includes an electrical water pump that operates using electrical energy and which is connected to an energy meter that periodically provides for a previous period of time energy usage data for the previous period of time, the method comprising the steps of: receiving and storing the energy usage data associated with the irrigation system for the previous period of time in a database; using the energy usage data for the previous period of time to estimate water usage for the previous period of time using a data processing computer system coupled to the database that operates upon the energy usage data, wherein the data processing system that operates upon the energy usage data uses machine learning in obtaining the water usage estimate based on a type of pump curve that relates water flow, horse power, and feet of head; and preparing the water record based upon the estimated water usage using the data processing computer system.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein the previous period of time is at least a 24 hour period.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the previous period of time is at least a one hour period.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein the previous period of time is a one minute period.
7. The method according to claim 2, wherein the previous period of time is at least a 24 hour period.
8. The method according to claim 2, wherein the previous period of time is at least a one hour period.
9. The method according to claim 2, wherein the previous period of time is a one minute period.
10. The method according to claim 3, wherein the previous period of time is at least a 24 hour period.
11. The method according to claim 3, wherein the previous period of time is at least a one hour period.
12. The method according to claim 3, wherein the previous period of time is a one minute period.
