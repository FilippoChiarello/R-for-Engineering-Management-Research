ENCRYPTION METHOD AND SYSTEM BASED ON IMAGES.
</title>

<abstract>
It is described a digital processing system (100), comprising: an encryption apparatus (104) comprising: an input (103) configured to receive first digital data (m) to be encrypted; an encryption module (104) configured to process the first digital data (m) with an encryption function (E) so as to generate a first input digital image (IMm) associated to the first digital data; a rotation module (105) configured to process the first input digital image (IMm) according to a function (X) to produce a plurality of modified digital images formula I including at least one first modified digital image formula II obtained by rotating the input first digital image (IMm) of a pre-established non–zero angle.

<claims>
1. Digital processing method, comprising:
an encryption processing comprising:
providing first digital data ( m ) to be encrypted;
processing the first digital data (m) with an encryption function (IE) so as to generate a first input digital image (IMm) associated to the first digital data; and
processing the first input digital image (IMm) according to a rotation function (X) to produce a plurality of modified digital images
including at least one first modified digital image obtained by rotating
the input first digital image (IMm) of a pre-established non-zero angle.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of modified digital images ({/M^}) comprises: a first encrypted image rotated of 0°, a second encrypted image rotated of 90°, a third encrypted image rotated of 180° and a fourth encrypted image rotated of 270° with respect to the first input digital image (IMm).
3. The method of claim 1, wherein further including: randomly adding noise and/ or distortion to the plurality of modified digital images
4. The method of claim 1 or 3, further comprising a decryption processing, comprising:
processing at least one image of the plurality of modified digital images with a decryption function (D) providing a plurality of decrypted
digital data ( m' ) together with a plurality of angle values (a) each associated with a corresponding modified digital image
analysing the plurality of decrypted digital data ( m ') to evaluate if the first digital data ( m ) has been correctly recognised.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the encryption function (IE) and the decryption function (ID)) are parametric functions.
6 The method of claim 5 further comprising:
configuring the encryption function (IE), the rotation function (X) and the decryption function (ID)) by an optimization algorithm taking into account noise and/ or distortion which can be added to the plurality of modified digital images
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of modified digital images are employable in at least one of the following application:
Watermarking, Steganography, Asymmetric Encryption, Augmented Reality and Automatic Identification.
8. The method of claim 3 or 4, further comprising:
configuring the encryption function (IE), the rotation function (X) and the decryption function (ID)) in order to ensure that the first input digital image (IMm) shows a style of a reference image (IMs); wherein the configuration of the encryption, the rotation and the decryption functions is performed according to a Generative Adversarial Network.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the encryption function (IE) and the decryption function (©) are Deep Neural Networks.
10. Digital processing system (100), comprising:
an encryption apparatus (104) comprising:
an input (103) configured to receive first digital data ( m ) to be encrypted; an encryption module (104) configured to process the first digital data (m) with an encryption function (IE) so as to generate a first input digital image (IMm) associated to the first digital data;
a rotation module (105) configured to process the first input digital image (IMm) according to a rotation function (X) to produce a plurality of modified digital images including at least one first modified digital image
obtained by rotating the input first digital image (IMm) of a pre-established non-zero angle.
