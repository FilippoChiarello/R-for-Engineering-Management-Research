<title>
DoS detection configuration
</title>

<abstract>
A method for configuring a network monitoring device is provided. One or more performance metrics associated with one or more thresholds to be configured are received from a user. Historical network traffic flow information associated with a previously detected malicious activity is analyzed to identify characteristic values for the one or more performance metrics. Threshold values are automatically configured based on the identified characteristic values.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A network monitoring device comprising: a memory configured to store instructions; one or more processors disposed in communication with the memory and communicatively coupled to a plurality of network nodal devices, wherein the one or more processors upon execution of the instructions is configured to: receive from a user one or more performance metrics associated with one or more thresholds to be configured; receive from a user designation of a subgroup of nodal devices from the plurality of network nodal devices consisting of at least two nodal devices (single managed data object devices); analyze, by the one or more processors, historical network traffic flow information associated with a previously detected malicious activity regarding the single managed data object devices in reverse from the end time of a predetermined period towards a beginning time of the predetermined time period to identify characteristic values for the one or more performance metrics for the single managed data object devices, wherein the performance metrics include one or more of: maximum data rate in bps (bits per second) and pps (packets per second) on a router, maximum transmission rate of an interface link, maximum throughput rate through a managed object, maximum transmission rate of individual TCP connections (SYN packets) through a managed object and UDP traffic conditions through a managed object; automatically configure, by the one or more processors, threshold values based on the identified characteristic values; store the configured threshold values in a data repository; evaluate the configured threshold values stored in the data repository based upon user input regarding performance metrics over time associated with the configured threshold settings; present to the user via a user interface, by the one or more processors, interactive visual information in a user interactive graph provided on the user interface displaying the effect of the automatically configured threshold values using the historical network traffic flow information for the single managed data object devices; monitor, by the one or more processors, network traffic for the single managed data object devices to determine when the network traffic exceeds the automatically configured threshold values; and generate, by the one or more processors, an alert responsive to the determination that the network traffic for the single managed data object devices exceeds one or more of the configured threshold values.
2. The network monitoring device as recited in claim 1, wherein analyzing historical network traffic flow information comprises discarding, by the one or more processors, a portion of the historical network traffic flow information.
3. The network monitoring device as recited in claim 1, wherein the historical network traffic flow information is stored in a storage repository.
