<abstract>
(c) determining the state of the light of the image stream by processing the verified extracted points comprising an item to be checked.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of assessing the condition of one or more lights in an airfield ground lighting system, the method comprising: capturing by an image acquisition means an image stream of the light of the airfield ground lighting system by moving a housing having the image acquisition means disposed therein across said light; detecting the location information of the image acquisition means whilst capturing the plurality of images comprised in the image stream by a location sensor coupled image acquisition means; processing the image stream of a light of the airfield ground lighting system by a processor coupled to the image acquisition means by: (a) associating characteristics of a plurality of points in an image with an item to be checked in the image of the light to be checked, and (b) extracting the points from the images of the image stream wherein said extraction is by; (i) analysing a plurality of randomly selected pairs of images from the images of the image stream to determine a plurality of tentative reference locations, one for each of the pairs of images for each extracted point relative to a three dimensional coordinate frame of the light; (ii) assessing the tentative reference locations determined for each extracted point, to determine a reference location for each extracted point; (c) projecting each extracted point into the images of the image stream based upon the determined reference location of said each extracted point and location information of the image acquisition means for each image; (d) analysing the images of the image stream by comparing the locations in the images of the extracted points and the corresponding projected points and calculating the proximity therebetween; (e) verifying existence in an image of a points of the item to be checked in the image stream of the light being checked by comparing the calculated proximity against a threshold value; (f) repeating steps (b) to (e) to verify existence of each point in the plurality of points associated with each item to be checked in the light being checked; and (g) determining the state of the item to be checked based upon analysis of verified points.
2. An airfield ground lighting inspection system comprising: a housing having an image acquisition means attached thereto configured for capturing a plurality of image streams of a plurality of lights comprised in an airfield ground lighting system upon movement of the housing across the airfield; a location sensor for detecting location information for the image acquisition means capturing the plurality of images comprised in the image streams; an image processor coupled to the image acquisition means and the location sensor for processing the image stream of a light of the airfield ground lighting system by: (a) associating characteristics of a plurality of points in an image with an item to be checked in the image of the light to be checked, and (b) extracting the points from the images of the image stream wherein said extraction is by; (i) analysing a plurality of randomly selected pairs of images from the images of the image stream to determine a plurality of tentative reference locations, one for each of the pairs of images for each extracted point relative to a three dimensional coordinate frame of the light; (ii) assessing the tentative reference locations determined for each extracted point, to determine a reference location for each extracted point; (c) projecting each extracted point into the images of the image stream based upon the determined reference location of said each extracted point and location information of the image acquisition means for each image; (d) analysing the images of the image stream by comparing the locations in the images of the extracted points and the corresponding projected points and calculating the proximity therebetween; (e) verifying existence in an image of points of the item to be checked in the image stream of the light being checked by comparing the calculated proximity against a threshold value; (f) repeating steps (b) to (e) to verify existence of each point in the plurality of points associated with each item to be checked in the light being checked; and (g) determining the state of the item to be checked based upon analysis of verified points.
3. The airfield ground lighting inspection system according to claim 2 wherein the system is configured to verify any one or more of: the presence of a crack; the absence of any one or more of a bolt, a nut, a ring, and an inset light; the orientation of any one or more of a bolt, a nut, a ring, an inset light and a crack; or predetermined markings identifying the light at a predetermined location on said light.
4. The airfield ground lighting inspection system according to claim 2 wherein the images are acquired under ambient lighting conditions.
5. The airfield ground lighting inspection system according to claim 2 wherein an additional illumination means is attached to the movable housing for lighting the lights for image acquisition.
6. The airfield ground lighting inspection system according to claim 2 wherein a tentative reference location for a point in each pair of images analysed is determined using the positional information of the image acquisition means for that pair of images and the detected location of that point in the pair of images.
7. The airfield ground lighting inspection system according to claim 2 wherein the points extracted in an image of the image stream are extracted using an algorithm selected from the histogram of oriented gradient algorithm and normalised gradient analysis algorithm.
