SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DERIVING HIGH-RESOLUTION SUBSURFACE RESERVOIR PARAMETERS
</title>

<abstract>
A method is described for deriving high-resolution reservoir properties for a subsurface reservoir. The method may include receiving a seismic dataset; inverting the seismic dataset to generate an ensemble of coarse-scale seismic parameters, wherein the inverting may use one of Bayesian models with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, simulated annealing, partial swarm, or analytic Bayes formulations; receiving fine-scale lithotype models; developing deep learning neural networks based on transfer learning using the fine-scale lithotype models to generate a conditional probability distribution of high-resolution reservoir parameters; generating an ensemble of high-resolution reservoir parameters using the deep learning neural network to condition the ensemble of coarse-scale seismic parameters; and displaying, on a user interface, the ensemble of high-resolution reservoir parameters. The method is executed by a computer system.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method of generating fine-scale subsurface reservoir properties, comprising: a. receiving, at one or more processors, a seismic dataset representative of a subsurface volume of interest; b. inverting, via the one or more processors, the seismic dataset to generate an ensemble of coarse-scale seismic parameters, wherein the inverting may use one of Bayesian models with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, simulated annealing, partial swarm, or analytic Bayes formulations; c. receiving, at the one or more processors, fine-scale lithotype models; d. developing, via the one or more processors, deep learning neural networks based on transfer learning using the fine-scale lithotype models to generate a conditional probability distribution of high-resolution reservoir parameters; e. generating, via the one or more processors, an ensemble of high-resolution reservoir parameters using the deep learning neural network to condition the ensemble of coarse-scale seismic parameters; and f. displaying, on a user interface, the ensemble of high-resolution reservoir parameters.
2. The method of claim 1 further comprising performing, via the one or more processors, flow simulation for each image in the ensemble of high-resolution reservoir parameters to generate an ensemble of flow simulation results.
3. The method of claim 2 further comprising receiving flow-related data at the one or more processors and comparing the flow-related data to the ensemble of flow simulation results.
4. The method of claim 3 further comprising using some criteria to select those models from the ensemble of flow simulation results that fit the flow-related data within a set variance.
5. A computer system, comprising: one or more processors; memory; and one or more programs, wherein the one or more programs are stored in the memory and configured to be executed by the one or more processors, the one or more programs including instructions that when executed by the one or more processors cause the device to execute the method of claim 1.
6. A non-transitory computer readable storage medium storing one or more programs, the one or more programs comprising instructions, which when executed by an electronic device with one or more processors and memory, cause the device to execute the method of claim 1.
