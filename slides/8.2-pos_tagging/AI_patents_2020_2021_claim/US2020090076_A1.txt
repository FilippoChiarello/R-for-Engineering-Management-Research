<title>
NON-TRANSITORY COMPUTER-READABLE RECORDING MEDIUM, PREDICTION METHOD, AND LEARNING DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A learning device creates a plurality of decision trees, using pieces of training data respectively including an explanatory variable and an objective variable, which are configured by a combination of the explanatory variables and respectively estimate the objective variable based on true or false of the explanatory variables. The learning device creates a linear model that is equivalent to the plurality of decision trees, and lists all terms configured by a combination of the explanatory variables without omission. The learning device outputs a prediction result by using the linear model from input data.

<claims>
1. A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium having stored therein a program that causes a computer to execute a process comprising: creating a plurality of decision trees, using pieces of training data respectively including an explanatory variable and an objective variable, which are configured by a combination of the explanatory variables and respectively estimate the objective variable based on true or false of the explanatory variables; creating a linear model that is equivalent to the plurality of decision trees and lists all terms configured by a combination of the explanatory variables without omission; and outputting a prediction result by using the linear model from input data.
2. The non-transitory computer-readable recording medium according to claim 1, wherein the creating includes creating a plurality of partial linear models corresponding to each of the decision trees by using a sum of paths with a leaf being true or a sum of paths with a leaf being false, and creating a result acquired by dividing a sum of the partial linear models by a total number of the decision trees as the linear model equivalent to the plurality of decision trees.
3. The non-transitory computer-readable recording medium according to claim 1, wherein the outputting includes predicting that the prediction result corresponds to the objective variable when the prediction result is equal to or larger than a threshold, predicting that the prediction result does not correspond to the objective variable when the prediction result is smaller than the threshold.
4. A prediction method comprising: creating a plurality of decision trees, using pieces of training data respectively including an explanatory variable and an objective variable, which are configured by a combination of the explanatory variables and respectively estimate the objective variable based on true or false of the explanatory variables, using a processor; creating a linear model that is equivalent to the plurality of decision trees and lists all terms configured by a combination of the explanatory variables without omission, using the processor; and outputting a prediction result by using the linear model from input data, using the processor.
5. A prediction method comprising: specifying, from pieces of training data respectively including an explanatory variable and an objective variable, a combination of the explanatory variables, using a processor; creating a linear model that is configured by a combination of the explanatory variables, is equivalent to a plurality of decision trees that respectively estimate the objective variable based on true or false of the explanatory variables, and lists all terms configured by a combination of the explanatory variables without omission, using the processor; and outputting a prediction result by using the linear model from input data, using the processor.
6. A learning device comprising: a memory; and a processor coupled to the memory and the processor configured to: create a plurality of decision trees, using pieces of training data respectively including an explanatory variable and an objective variable, which are configured by a combination of the explanatory variables and respectively estimate the objective variable based on true or false of the explanatory variables; create a linear model that is equivalent to the plurality of decision trees and lists all terms configured by a combination of the explanatory variables without omission; and output a prediction result by using the linear model from input data.
