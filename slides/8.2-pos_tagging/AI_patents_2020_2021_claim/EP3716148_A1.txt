ITEM CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM, DEVICE AND METHOD THEREFOR
</title>

<abstract>
An image processing system for categorising the colour of an item is disclosed. The system comprises processing means configured to: process an image of an item to extract a portion of the image where the item is located; determine a first average colour value of a plurality of colour values associated with the portion of the image where the item is located; map the average colour value to one of a plurality of predetermined colour definitions based on a plurality of colour ranges associated with each colour definition; and categorise the colour of the item according to the mapping.

<claims>
1. An image processing system for categorising the colour of an item, the system comprising:
processing means configured to: i. process an image of an item to extract a portion of the image where the item is located; ii. determine a first average colour value of a plurality of colour values associated with the portion of the image where the item is located; iii. mapping the average colour value to one of a plurality of predetermined colour definitions based on a plurality of colour ranges associated with each colour definition; and iv. categorising the colour of the item according to the mapping.
2. The system of claim 1 wherein the first average colour value is determined according to a first colour space and wherein the processing means is further configured to determine a second average colour value according to a second colour space wherein the first colour space is different from the second colour space.
3. The system of claim 2 wherein the processing means is further configured to determine a single average colour for the plurality of channels defining the first colour space and preferably to determine a plurality of average colours for each of the plurality of channels defining the second colour space.
4. The system of claims 2 or 3 wherein the first colour space is a red, green, blue colour space and preferably wherein the second colour space is a hue, saturation and value colour space.
5. The system of any preceding claim wherein the processing means is further configured to determine a plurality of dominant colours associated with the portion of the image and preferably to determine colour values for each of the plurality of dominant colours and further preferably wherein each dominant colour is determined using k-means clustering.
6. The system of any preceding claim wherein the processing means is further configured to categorise the colour of the item using a model (619) based on the determined average colour value or/and the dominant colours associated with the image.
7. The system of claim 6 further comprising training the model (619) using the determined dominant colour values or/and the average colour values and preferably wherein the model is a random forest model (619).
8. The system of any preceding claim wherein the processing means is further configured to generate training data using the image of the item wherein the training data comprises any one or more of: a. the or an image of the item; b. the or an associated colour classification of the item; c. the or an average colour values of the item; and d. the or further dominant colour values of the item.
9. The system of claim 8 wherein the average colour values and the dominant colour values are determined from an extracted portion of the image where the item is located.
10. A baggage handling system comprising the image processing system of claim 1 wherein the item is an item of baggage for check in at an airport.
11. The baggage handling system of any preceding claim wherein the system is configured to categorise the colour of the item in response to a passenger or agent placing the item of baggage on a bag drop belt.
12. The baggage handling system of any preceding claim wherein the processing means is further configured to determine a bounding box enclosing at least a portion of the bag within the image.
13. The baggage handling system of any preceding claim wherein the processing means is further configured to extract a portion of the image containing the bag using a grab cut function.
14. An image processing system for categorising the colour of an item, the system comprising:
processing means configured to: i. process an image of an item to extract a portion of the image where the item is located; ii. determine a first average colour value of a plurality of colour values associated with the portion of the image where the item is located; iii. determine a plurality of dominant colour values associated with the portion of the image where the item is located; and iv. categorising the colour of the item according to the first average colour value and the plurality of dominant colour values.
15. A method for executing the system of any preceding claim and preferably a computer program product which when executed undertakes the method.
