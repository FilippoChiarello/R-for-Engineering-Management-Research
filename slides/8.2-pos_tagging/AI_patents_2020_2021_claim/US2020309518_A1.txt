ROAD SURFACE STATE DETERMINATION APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
A road surface state determination apparatus includes a plurality of tire-side devices each of which detects vibration applied to corresponding tire and produces road surface data indicative of a road surface state based on data of the vibration, and a vehicle-body-side system that determines the road surface state based on the road surface data.

<claims>
1. A road surface state determination apparatus comprising: a plurality of tire-side devices to be attached individually to a plurality of tires of a vehicle, each of the tire-side devices including a vibration detection unit that outputs a detection signal corresponding to a magnitude of vibration of the tire, a waveform processing unit that generates road surface data representing a road surface state appearing in a waveform of the detection signal, and a first data communication unit that transmits the road surface data; and a vehicle-body-side system including a second data communication unit that receives the road surface data transmitted from the first data communication unit and a road surface determination unit that determines, based on the road surface data, a road surface state of a road surface on which the vehicle travels, wherein the plurality of tire-side devices are configured to receive the road surface data from each other, the first data communication units of the plurality of tire-side devices and the second data communication unit of the vehicle-body-side system are configured to enable bidirectional communication between the first data communication units and the second data communication unit, and the road surface determination unit of the vehicle-body-side system measures received radio wave intensities when the second data communication unit receives the road surface data transmitted from the plurality of tire-side devices, sets at least one of the plurality of tire-side devices which is higher in received radio wave intensity than an other tire-side device to a central device, while setting the other tire-side device to a peripheral device, and causes the second data communication unit to transmit data indicating whether each of the plurality of tire-side devices is either the central device or the peripheral device, and the first data communication unit of the central device is caused to transmit, to the vehicle-body-side system, road surface data including the road surface data of the peripheral device received through communication.
2. The road surface state determination apparatus according to claim 1, wherein after receiving the road surface data transmitted from each of the peripheral devices, the central device provides each of the road surface data of the central device and the road surface data of the peripheral devices with unique identification information and transmits, to the vehicle-body-side system, the road surface data of the central device and the road surface data of the peripheral devices with the respective unique identification information.
3. A road surface state determination apparatus comprising: a plurality of tire-side devices to be attached individually to a plurality of tires of a vehicle, each of the tire-side devices including a vibration detection unit that outputs a detection signal corresponding to a magnitude of vibration of the tire, a waveform processing unit that generates road surface data representing a road surface state appearing in a waveform of the detection signal, and a first data communication unit that transmits the road surface data; and a vehicle-body-side system including a second data communication unit that receives the road surface data transmitted from the first data communication unit and a road surface determination unit that determines, based on the road surface data, a road surface state of a road surface on which the vehicle travels, wherein the plurality of tire-side devices are configured to receive the road surface data from each other, and each of the plurality of tire-side devices transmits, to the vehicle-body-side system, road surface data including the road surface data received from another of the plurality of tire-side devices through communication.
4. A road surface state determination apparatus comprising: a plurality of tire-side devices to be attached individually to a plurality of tires included in a vehicle, each of the tire-side devices including a vibration detection unit that outputs a detection signal corresponding to a magnitude of vibration of the tire, a waveform processing unit that generates road surface data representing a road surface state appearing in a waveform of the detection signal, and a first data communication unit that transmits the road surface data; and a vehicle-body-side system including a second data communication unit that performs bidirectional communication with the first data communication unit and receives the road surface data and a road surface determination unit that determines, based on the road surface data, the road surface state of a road surface traveled by the vehicle, wherein the plurality of tire-side devices are configured to receive the road surface data from each other, and when the vehicle-body-side system fails to receive the road surface data of a part of the plurality of tire-side devices, the vehicle-body-side system provides a data request to one of the plurality of tire-side devices, the road surface data of which has been received successfully, to cause the one to transmit the road surface data of the part from the one.
