BIOMETRIC-MUSIC INTERACTION METHODS AND SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for the automatic, procedural generation of musical content in relation to biometric data. The systems and methods use a user's device, such as a cell phone to capture image data of a body part, and derive a biometric signal from the image data. The biometric signal includes biometric parameters, which are used by a music generation engine to generate music. The music generation can also be based on user-specific data and quality data related to the biometric detection process.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: configuring a mobile device to operate as a content management engine; acquiring, by the content management engine, biometric data from the mobile device; deriving, by the content management engine, a bio-state of an entity as a function of the biometric data; generating, by the content management engine, a content list or procedurally generated content from the bio-state; and configuring the mobile device to render the procedurally generated content or content associated with the content list.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein biometric data pertains to a user of the mobile device and wherein the rendered content provides a therapeutic effect on the user.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the bio-state comprises a physiological state.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the bio-state comprises a psychological state.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the mobile device comprises at least one of the following: a phone, a tablet, a phablet, a vehicle, a gaming device, and a medical device.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of acquiring biometric data from the mobile device comprises operating the mobile device as a photoplethysmograph.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of generating the content list includes classifying content according to an ontological classification scheme according to bio-state attributes representative of the bio-state.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the bio-state attributes include at least one of the following: stress levels, endurance levels, galvanic response, emotional characteristics, and vocal tone.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the content list comprises at least one of the following types of content: image data, audio data, music data, video data, game data, shopping data, medical data, and family data.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the content list comprises a music playlist.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the content list or the procedurally generated content comprises visual stimuli.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the content list comprises play rules that govern playback of content identified by the content list.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the play rules operate as a function of the bio-state.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the play rules operate as a function of the bio-state as feedback.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein the play rules operate as a function of the bio-state in real-time.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of configuring the mobile device to render the procedurally generated content or the content associated with the content list occurs substantially in real-time with respect to the step of deriving the bio-state.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the step of configuring the mobile device to render the procedurally generated content or the content associated with the content list occurs substantially within one minute to the step of deriving the bio-state.
18. A method comprising: configuring a mobile device of a user to operate as a content management engine; acquiring, by the content management engine, biometric data of the user from the mobile device; generating, by the content management engine, a visualization or audio representation of the biometric data configuring the mobile device to render the visualization or audio representation of the biometric data to the user to provide cross-modality feedback providing a therapeutic effect on the user; wherein the biometric data is the user's breath rate.
