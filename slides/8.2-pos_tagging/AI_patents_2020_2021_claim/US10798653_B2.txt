<title>
Systems and methods for managing communication between devices
</title>

<abstract>
A system for managing power on distributed devices may include a first device having a master logic and a second device having a slave logic. The master logic may enable the first device to communicate with multiple devices having the slave logic on one or more channels. The slave logic may enable the second device having the slave logic to communicate with the first device and to communicate with a third device having the slave logic. The slave logic may enable the multiple devices having the slave logic to manage operations of the distributed devices.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A configurable device for managing communication between devices, the configurable device comprising: one or more master channel connectors; one or more slave channel connectors; a master logic enabling the configurable device configured in a master mode to exchange clockless communication with multiple devices on one or more channels, the multiple devices having a slave logic, wherein the configurable device configured in the master mode communicates with one or more devices having the slave logic on a single channel over a wired serial connection via a single master channel connector of the configurable device; and a slave logic enabling the configurable device configured in a slave mode to: exchange clockless communication with a master device on a single channel over a first wired serial connection via a first slave channel connector of the configurable device, the master device having the master logic; and exchange clockless communication with a slave device on the single channel over a second wired serial connection via a second slave channel connector of the configurable device, the slave device having the slave logic.
2. The configurable device of claim 1, wherein the configurable device is reconfigurable between the master mode and the slave mode.
3. The configurable device of claim 1, wherein the configurable device is configurable once in the master mode or the slave mode.
4. The configurable device of claim 1, wherein the slave logic enables the configurable device configured in a slave mode to manage operations of one or more distributed devices via one or more of the slave channel connectors of the configurable device.
5. The configurable device of claim 4, wherein the distributed devices include a power device.
6. The configurable device of claim 5, wherein the configurable device is a part of the power device.
7. The configurable device of claim 1, wherein the configurable device addresses the slave device using at least one of pulse shaving and pulse adding.
8. The configurable device of claim 1, wherein the configurable device communicates using at least one of an open-gate configuration and a closed-gate configuration.
9. The configurable device of claim 1, wherein the master logic enables the configurable device to receive a signal sent on the single channel via another single master channel connector of the configurable device.
10. The configurable device of claim 1, wherein the master logic further enables the configurable device to communicate with a processor via a master data connector.
11. A master device for managing communication between devices, the master device comprising: one or more master channel connectors; and a master logic enabling the master device to exchange clockless communication with multiple devices on one or more channels, the multiple devices having a slave logic, wherein the master device communicates with one or more devices having the slave logic on a single channel over a wired serial connection via a single master channel connector of the master device; wherein the master device addresses the devices using at least one of pulse shaving and pulse adding.
12. The master device of claim 11, wherein the master logic enables the master device to receive a signal sent on the single channel via another single master channel connector of the master device.
13. The master device of claim 11, wherein the master device communicates using at least one of an open-gate configuration and a closed-gate configuration.
14. The master device of claim 11, wherein the master logic further enables the master device to communicate with a processor via a master data connector.
15. A slave device for managing communication between devices, the slave device comprising: a plurality of slave channel connectors; and a slave logic enabling the slave device to: exchange clockless communication with a master device on a single channel over a first wired serial connection via a first slave channel connector of the slave device and a single master channel connector of the master device, the master device having a master logic; exchange clockless communication with another slave device on the single channel over a second wired serial connection via a second slave channel connector of the slave device, the another slave device having the slave logic; wherein the slave device is addressed using at least one of pulse shaving and pulse adding.
16. The slave device of claim 15, wherein the slave logic enables the slave device to manage operations of one or more distributed devices via one or more of the slave channel connectors of the slave device.
17. The slave device of claim 16, wherein the distributed devices include a power device.
18. The slave device of claim 15, wherein the slave device communicates using at least one of an open-gate configuration and a closed-gate configuration.
