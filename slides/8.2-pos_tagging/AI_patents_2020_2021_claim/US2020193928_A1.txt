DISPLAY DEVICE AND ELECTRONIC DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A display device capable of performing image processing is provided. A memory node is provided in each pixel included in the display device. An intended correction data is held in the memory node. The correction data is calculated by an external device and written into each pixel. The correction data is added to image data by capacitive coupling, and the resulting data is supplied to a display element. Thus, the display element can display a corrected image. The correction enables image upconversion, for example.
