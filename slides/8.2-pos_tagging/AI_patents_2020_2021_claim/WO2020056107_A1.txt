<title>
AUTOMATED SIMULATION PIPELINE FOR FAST SIMULATION DRIVEN COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN
</title>

<abstract>
A computer aided design system for simulation driven design of a three-dimensional (3D) object includes a boundary condition extraction module that extracts a set of boundary conditions for each of a plurality of various known designs of 3D objects related to a new design for a proposed 3D object and generates a set of design independent boundary conditions representative of typical usage of the known designs. Design exploration module generates a plurality of design candidates for the new design. Morphing module transforms design independent boundary conditions into design specific boundary conditions for each of the design candidates. Performance prediction module includes a neural network model trained to predict performance of each design candidate based on learning from prior simulation results of known designs, and generates a set of key performance indicators for each design candidate. A best design choice is selected from the design candidates based on the key performance indicators.
