SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING A TRAJECTORY
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the disclosure provide a system and method for determining a trajectory of a subject. The method can include acquiring motion data of the subject to which the mobile device is attached; determining a motion status of the subject based on the motion data; and determining the trajectory based on the motion data using a trajectory model corresponding to the motion status.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for determining a trajectory of a subject, comprising: acquiring, via at least one sensor of a mobile device, motion data of the subject to which the mobile device is attached; determining, by a processor, a motion status of the subject based on the motion data; and determining, by the processor, the trajectory based on the motion data using a trajectory model corresponding to the motion status.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, herein the determining a motion status of the subject based on the motion data further comprises; determining at least one of a stride length, a stride frequency, and a direction of movement based on the motion data; and determining the motion status based on at least one of the stride length, the stride frequency, and the direction of movement, wherein the motion status comprises a movement gesture of the subject or a place on the subject where the mobile device is attached.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, wherein the determining the trajectory based on the motion data using a trajectory model corresponding to the motion status further comprises: generating the trajectory based on the at least one of the stride length, the stride frequency, and the direction of movement using the trajectory model corresponding to the motion status.

5. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, further comprising: acquiring the training data associated with the subject in a plurality of time periods; acquiring reference movements associated with the subject in respective time periods; clustering the training data and the reference movements into groups; and generating the trajectory model based on the training data and the reference movements of respective groups.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 5, wherein the generating the trajectory model based on the training data and the reference movements of the respective groups further comprises: generating the trajectory model using machine learning techniques.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 5, wherein each group is associated with a different motion status.
8. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the at least one sensor includes at least one of an accelerometer, a gyroscope, an electronic compass, or a barometer of the mobile device.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, wherein the training data comprises Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) data.
10. The method of claim 2, wherein the movement gesture comprises at least one of walking, jogging, or climbing.
11. A system for generating a trajectory of a subject, comprising: a communication interface configured to communicate with a mobile device attached to the subject, acquiring motion data of the subject; a memory configured to store at least one trajectory model; and at least one processor configured to: determine a motion status of the subject based on the motion data, and determine the trajectory based on the motion data using a trajectory model corresponding to the motion status.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to: determine at least one of a stride length, a stride frequency, and a direction of movement based on the motion data; and determine the motion status based on at east one of the stride length, the stride frequency, and the direction of movement, wherein the motion status comprises a movement gesture of the subject or a place on the subject where the mobile device is attached.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to: generate the trajectory based on the at least one of the stride length, the stride frequency, and the direction of movement using the trajectory model corresponding to the motion status.
