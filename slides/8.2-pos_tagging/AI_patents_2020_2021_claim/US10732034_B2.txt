</title>

<abstract>
System and methods for accurate measurement and real-time feedback of solar ultraviolet exposure for management of ultraviolet dose. The systems can include a wearable device and a mobile device, the system performing accurate measurement of UV exposure.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A wearable UV sensing device, comprising: a sensing housing that includes a back surface, a front surface with, in a side view of the housing, an outwardly curved configuration relative to the back surface, the front surface having a central region disposed further away from the back surface than a periphery of the front surface, the front surface made of a material adapted to block visible light, the front surface including an aperture formed therein allowing UV light to travel therethrough, a UV sensor positioned under the aperture so that UV light passing through the aperture can be sensed by the UV sensor, a wireless communication module configured to wirelessly communicate with an external device, a printed circuit board disposed within the sensing housing; and a releasable securing member, wherein the sensing housing also includes a securing surface, and the releasable securing member is configured to interact with the securing surface to releasably secure the sensing housing to the releasable securing member, wherein the releasable securing member has a curved configuration where it interacts with the securing surface.
2. The wearable UV sensing device of claim 1, wherein releasable securing member has an annular configuration where it interacts with the securing surface.
3. The wearable UV sensing device of claim 1, wherein the back surface comprises the securing surface.
4. The wearable UV sensing device of claim 1, wherein the aperture is in the central region of the front surface.
5. The wearable UV sensing device of claim 1, wherein the back surface is a flat back surface.
6. The wearable UV sensing device of claim 5, wherein the aperture is disposed further away from the flat back surface than a periphery of the front surface.
7. The wearable UV sensing device of claim 1, wherein the UV sensor is secured to the printed circuit board.
8. The wearable UV sensing device of claim 1, wherein the front surface comprises a second aperture formed therein.
9. The wearable UV sensing device of claim 1, further comprising a front casing that comprises the front surface.
10. The wearable UV sensing device of claim 9, further comprising a back casing that comprises the back surface.
11. The wearable UV sensing device of claim 10, wherein the front casing and the back casing are secured to one another.
12. The wearable UV sensing device of claim 1, further comprising a diffuser disposed between the printed circuit board and a front casing, the front casing comprising the front surface.
13. The wearable UV sensing device of claim 1, further comprising an annular magnetic element between the printed circuit board and a back casing, the back casing comprising the back surface.
