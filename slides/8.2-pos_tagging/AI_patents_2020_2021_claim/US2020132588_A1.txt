DEVICE AND METHOD FOR MEASURING AND TRACKING THE QUANTITY OR CONCENTRATION OF A COMPOUND IN A FLUID
</title>

<abstract>
A device for measuring and tracking over time the quantity or concentration of a component in a fluid comprises: a sensor capable of measuring a quantity or concentration of the component in the fluid and providing a quantitative signal for tracking this quantity or concentration over time; a signal-processing module comprising a low-pass filter of the quantitative tracking signal; and an output interface for providing the filtered quantitative tracking signal. The signal-processing module comprises an estimator of a value of instantaneous trend of variation of the quantitative tracking signal in a predetermined sliding time window. Also provided is means for adjusting over time a high cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter according to the estimated value of instantaneous trend of variation.
