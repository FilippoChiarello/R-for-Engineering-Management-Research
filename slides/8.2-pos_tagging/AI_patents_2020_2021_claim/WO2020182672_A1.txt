CLOSED LOOP RECYCLING PROCESS AND SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
This invention relates to a closed loop process and system for collecting and recycling of materials commonly used for packaging. The process comprises the steps of collecting and sorting of items containing material to be recycled, creating one or more datasets relating to the portions of sorted materials containing information relating to the quantity and origin as well as identity, brand, type and/or quality of sorted material, and registering at least the quantity and origin and optionally also about identity, brand, type and/or quality of sorted material in a blockchain. Embodiments of the invention comprise performing software assisted item recognition for determining at least one property of an item.

<claims>
1. A process for recycling material, comprising the steps of a. collecting a plurality of items of material that comprise one or more materials to be recycled, b. sorting the collected items of material according to their identity, brand, type and/or quality, to obtain portions of sorted material items, c. creating one or more datasets relating to the portions of sorted materials, the da tasets containing information relating to the quantity and origin of sorted material, and further containing information about identity, brand, type and/or quality of the sorted material, d. reporting information at least about the quantity and origin of sorted material, and optionally also about identity, brand, type and/or quality, to a network of nodes for registration in a blockchain.
2. Process according to claim 1 , wherein the step of sorting items of material includes for at least some of the plurality of items: separating items of material into smaller items according to their identity, type and/or quality.
3. Process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the identity of an item refers to the identification of the item based on an identifier such as a tag or other features that are specific, or pseudo-specific to said individual item, the brand of an item refers to the origin of the item such as the items manufacturer or retailer, the type of an item refers to materials used in the item such as the polymer or polymer mixture that the item contains, the quality of the item refers to the status of the item such as the cleanliness, the purity relating to the material, or the size of the item, and/or the quantity refers to the weight, volume and/or number of material items.
4. Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the steps of collecting and sorting take place in the same or different locations, and/or wherein the process comprises the additional step of transferring items of material from a collecting entity to a sorting entity.
5. Process according to claim 4, wherein the process comprises the additional step of reporting at least the quantity of transferred material, and optionally also identity, brand, type and/or quality, to a network of nodes for registration in a blockchain.
6. Process according to at least one of the preceding claims, comprising the step of providing a material items database configured to store information about material items, such as type and weight of an item.
7. Process according to at least one of the preceding claims, wherein the sorting step comprises determining at least one property of an item, such as identity, brand, type, quality and/or quantity.
8. Process according to claim 7, wherein
- determining at least one property of an item comprises performing software assisted item recognition is utilized.
9. Process according to claim 7 or 8, wherein
- a machine learning method for determining at least one property of the item is uti lized is utilized.
10. Process according to one of claims 7 to 9, wherein
- a supervised machine learning method, such as a support vector machine or an arti ficial neural net, for determining at least one property of the item is utilized.
11. Process according to at least one of claims 7 to 10, wherein determining at least one property of an item includes accessing information about raw material items from the material items database.
12. Process according to at least one of claims 7 to 11 , wherein determining at least one property of an item comprises utilizing at least one item property capturing device such as a spectral sensor, a photometer, a camera, a weighing scale, a hardness tester, a QR code reader and/or a bar code reader.
13. Process according to claim 1 , further comprising before step a. the step of providing a material items database configured to store information about material items, such as type and weight of an item, wherein
- step b. comprises determining at least one property of an item, such as identity, brand, type, quality and/or quantity,
- determining at least one property of an item comprises performing software assisted item recognition,
- a machine learning method for determining the at least one property of an item is utilized, and
- determining the at least one property of an item includes accessing information about raw material items from the material items database.
14. Process according to at least one of the preceding claims, comprising the step of adding a block to the blockchain, the block containing information about at least the quantity of sorted material, and optionally also identity, brand, type and/or quality of sorted material.
15. Process according to at least one of the preceding claims, wherein the reported infor mation is made available to one or more recyclers.
16. Process according to at least one of the preceding claims, wherein a material transfer from a delivering participant to a receiving participant is reported to the network of nodes, such as a material transfer from a collector to a sorter is reported by the collec tor.
17. Process according to claim 16, wherein a token transfer is executed by the blockchain.
18. Recycling system for recycling for recycling material, comprising at least one network of nodes administering a blockchain data structure configured to receive and store reported information at least about the quantity and origin of sorted material, and optionally also about identity, brand, type and/or quality, computer hardware and software run by a sorter configured a) to generate one or more datasets in a predetermined format, the datasets containing information relating to quantity, origin, identity, brand, type and/or quality of the recyclable material contained in the material items sorted, and b) to report the dataset(s) and/or all or a part of the available information at least about the quantity and origin of sorted material items, and optionally al so about identity, brand, type and/or quality, to the network of nodes for reg istration in the blockchain; computer hardware and software run by a recycler configured to read the dataset(s) and/or all or a part of the information reported by the sorter.
19. System according to claim 18, wherein the system comprises means for performing software assisted image recognition configured to classify material items into categories.
20. System according to claim 18 or 19, wherein the system comprises means for performing software assisted image recognition which includes machine learning.
21. System according to one of claims 18 to 20, wherein the system comprises a material items database having material item information stored therein.
22. System according to one of claims 18 to 21 , wherein the computer hardware is selected from a stationary computer, a portable comput er, a smartphone, a server, and a tablet computer.
23. System according to one of claims 18 to 22, wherein the system comprises at least one collecting container comprising computer hard ware and software for collecting information relating to quantity, identity, brand, type and/or quality of the material items.
