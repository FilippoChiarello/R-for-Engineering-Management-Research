<title>
Methods and systems for multidisciplinary research collaboration
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for multidisciplinary team collaboration may include an algorithm for determining suitable relationships between the team members; a visualization interface for illustrating and managing members in separate groups according to their profiles, expertise, work output, and/or project roles; and the analysis of how members interact and use knowledge content. In the disclosed method, lived-work practices and/or knowledge content may be incorporated in the system to account for human behavior and expand upon existing documented work processes.

2. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, further comprising displaying, by the computer, a graphical user interface on the client computing device of each of the plurality of users, which displays a user profile of the plurality of users and one or more groups associated with each user of the plurality of users.
3. The computer-implemented method according to claim 2, further comprising identifying, by the computer, records in the database associated with each of the plurality of users, wherein a record of each of the plurality of users comprises profile information associated with the user.
4. The computer-implemented method according to claim 3, further comprising determining, by the computer, the records of the plurality of users that are related to each other based on the attributes associated to the records, wherein the attributes associated to the records comprises at least a level of expertise associated to each of the plurality of users.
5. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the each of the one or more second teams comprises the users having a same job title or a discipline.
6. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the each of the one or more second teams comprises the users having a same job function.
7. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, further comprising: receiving, by the computer, from the client computing device, a request associated with execution of a new project; and determining, by the computer, whether the execution of the new project requires knowledge data or information associated to the plurality of users based on processing of tasks within the new project.
8. The computer-implemented method according to claim 7, further comprising, upon determining that the request is for the knowledge data associated to the plurality of users, automatically generating, by the computer, a plurality of groups comprising a subset of users from the plurality of users to execute the tasks of the new project based on the updated preprocessed data associated to each of the plurality of users, wherein each user is assigned to one of the plurality of groups.
9. The computer-implemented method according to claim 8, further comprising, upon determining that the request is for the information associated to the plurality of users, automatically generating, by the computer, a plurality of groups comprising a subset of users from the plurality of users to execute the tasks of the new project based on lived-work practices of each of the users of each of the one or more second teams while executing the one or more tasks, wherein each user is assigned to one of the plurality of groups.
10. A system for generating a relationship model, the system comprising: a database; a processor; and a non-transitory computer-readable medium having computer-readable instructions that when executed by the processor is configured to: collect raw data comprising exchange of interactions between a plurality of users on a plurality of social networking sources via a plurality of user interfaces displayed on a plurality of client computing devices associated with the plurality of users, and wherein the raw data is stored in the database; index the raw data to generate preprocessed data, wherein the preprocessed data is stored in the database; determine attributes associated with each of the plurality of the users within the preprocessed data relating to each user within the plurality of users, the attributes defining lived-work practices of each user; generate a relationship model algorithm configured to receive an input of the preprocessed data; generate, by executing the relationship model algorithm, one or more first teams containing users sharing common lived-work practices determined from the preprocessed data, the lived-work practices enabling the users to execute one or more tasks received from a first client computing device; determine attributes associated with each of the plurality of users within an employee profile of each user within the plurality of users, the attributes defining expertise of each user; generate one or more third teams containing the users from the plurality of users sharing common expertise determined from the employee profile, the common expertise enabling the users to execute the one or more tasks; iteratively update the preprocessed data based on new raw data associated with the plurality of users generated from a new exchange of interactions between the plurality of users, wherein the relationship model algorithm causes the computer to periodically query the database to receive the new raw data; adjust the relationship model algorithm using updated preprocessed data associated with the plurality of users, the server adjusting the relationship model using at least one attribute associated with a process undertaken by at least one user to execute the one or more tasks, the at least one attribute defining updated lived-work practices of the user; generate, by executing an adjusted relationship model algorithm, one or more second teams containing users sharing common updated lived-work practices determined from the updated preprocessed data, the common updated lived-work practices enabling the users to execute the one or more tasks, wherein the one or more second teams includes one or more users not included in the one or more first teams; and present a recommendation to assign either the second team or the third team to execute the one or more tasks.
