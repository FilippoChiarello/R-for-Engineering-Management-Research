CLASSIFYING AN INPUT DATA SET WITHIN A DATA CATEGORY USING MULTIPLE DATA RECOGNITION TOOLS
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method and system are disclosed for classifying an input data set within a data category using multiple data recognition tools. The method includes identifying at least a first attribute and a second attribute of the data category; classifying the at least first attribute via at least a first data recognition tool and the at least second attribute via at least a second data recognition tool, the classifying including: allocating a confidence factor for each of the at least first and second attributes that indicates a presence of each of the at least first and second attributes in the input data set; and combining outputs of the classifying into a single output confidence score by using a weighted fusion of the allocated confidence factors.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for identifying an image or object by classifying an input data set of attributes within a data category using multiple data recognition tools, the method comprising:
identifying at least a first attribute and a second attribute of the data category;
classifying the at least first attribute via at least a first data recognition tool and the at least second attribute via at least a second data recognition tool, the classifying including allocating a confidence factor that indicates a presence of each attribute in the input data set; and
combining outputs of the classifying into a single output confidence by using a weighted fusion of the allocated confidence factors to indicate a confidence that the input data set has been classified correctly according to data category.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the allocating of the confidence factor for an attribute is based on a type of attribute and a quality of the input data set.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the input data set is biometric data and the data category is at least one of a facial image, a fingerprint, iris image, palm image, hand geometry, or DNA.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the data category is a facial image and at least one of the at least first or second attributes is at least one of facial expression, pose, partial image, image contrast, illumination, tone, image pitch, pose, perspective, or other type of facial quality attributes for the facial image.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the input data set is acoustic data and the data attribute is one of audio pitch, tone, loudness, timbre, or other type of acoustic quality attributes.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the input data set is behavioral characteristics data and each data attribute is one of signal-to-noise ratio, contrast, motion blur, or other type of behavioral quality attributes.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the input data set is a combination of acoustic data, biometric data, and behavioral characteristics data.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the first attribute data is classified based on a logistic regression algorithm.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the second attribute data is classified based on a neural network algorithm.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the combining outputs comprises:
applying a multi-algorithm fusion approach.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the multi-algorithm fusion approach is based on a logistic regression algorithm, a neural network algorithm, or a combination of logistic regression and neural network algorithms.
12. A system for identifying an image or object by classifying an input data set of attributes within a data category using multiple data recognition tools, the system comprising: an identification module configured to identify at least a first attribute and a second attribute of the data category;
a classification module configured to classify the at least first attribute via at least a first data recognition tool and the at least second attribute via at least a second data recognition tool, the classification including allocating a confidence factor for each of the at least first and second attributes that indicates a presence and identification of each of the at least first and second attribute in the input data set; and
a combination module configured to combine outputs of the classifying into a single output confidence by using a weighted fusion of the allocated confidence factors to indicate a confidence that the input data set has been classified correctly according to data category.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the classification module is configured to allocate a confidence factor for an attribute based on a type of attribute and a quality of the input data set.
14. The system of claim 12, wherein the combination module is configured to applying a multi-algorithm fusion approach to combine outputs of the classification module into a single output confidence score.
15. The system of claim 12, wherein the combination module is configured to execute a multi-algorithm fusion approach.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the multi-algorithm fusion approach is based on a logistic regression algorithm, a neural network algorithm, or a combination of logistic regression and neural network algorithms.
17. The system of claim 14, comprising:
a physical data interface to provide the single output confidence score.
