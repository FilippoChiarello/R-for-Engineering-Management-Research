<title>
MOBILE ROBOT PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTAL MAPPING FOR HOUSEHOLD ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL
</title>

<abstract>
A mobile robot includes a processor connected to a memory and a wireless network circuit, for executing routines stored in the memory and commands generated by the routines and received via the wireless network circuit. The processor drives the mobile robot to a multiplicity of accessible two dimensional locations within a household, and commands an end effector, including at least one motorized actuator, to perform mechanical work in the household. A plurality of routines include a first routine which monitors a wireless local network and detects a presence of a network entity on the wireless local network, a second routine which receives a signal from a sensor detecting an action state of one of the network entities, the action state changeable between waiting and active, and a third routine which commands the end effector to change state of performing mechanical work based on the presence and on the action state.

<claims>
That which is claimed is:
1. A computer-implemented method for operating a cleaning robot, the method comprising: providing at least one user-selectable cleaning strategy control element at a user terminal, the user-selectable pre-planned cleaning strategy control element having at least a deep cleaning strategy control state and a quick cleaning strategy control state, wherein: responsive to selection of the deep cleaning strategy control state, the user terminal commands the remote cleaning robot to execute a relatively higher cumulative energy cleaning strategy; and responsive to selection of the quick cleaning strategy control state, the user terminal commands the remote cleaning robot to execute a relatively lower cumulative energy cleaning strategy, wherein the relatively lower cumulative energy cleaning strategy includes the remote cleaning robot concentrating its cleaning in open areas and/or in designated areas.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the relatively higher cumulative energy cleaning strategy includes the remote cleaning robot concentrating its cleaning on edges and corners of a living space.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the at least one user-selectable pre-planned cleaning strategy control element comprises a cleaning strategy button configured to receive user selection from a plurality of different cleaning modes, the plurality of different cleaning modes comprises at least the deep cleaning strategy control state and the quick cleaning strategy control state.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the at least one user-selectable pre-planned cleaning strategy control element comprises a graphically displayed element for receiving a user input.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the quick cleaning strategy control state comprises a deterministic, planned travel pattern over a cleaning area in a single-pass.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the quick cleaning strategy control state comprises a faster forward speed as compared to a speed in the deep cleaning strategy control state.
7. A computer-implemented method for operating a cleaning robot, the method comprising: displaying a graphical representation of a map of an area at a user terminal, the graphical representation comprising a plurality of subdivisions of the map; and providing at least one user-selectable pre-planned cleaning strategy control element, the cleaning strategy control element being configured to receive input from the user to select an associated cleaning strategy from a plurality of cleaning strategies for one or more of the plurality of subdivisions of the map.
8. The computer-implemented method of claim 7, wherein the plurality of subdivisions of the map comprise a room identity.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 8, wherein the room identities comprise an area of the map, a transition line from one subdivision to another subdivision, or as localized markers within the map.
10. The computer-implemented method of claim 7, wherein the plurality of subdivisions of the map comprises at least a first subdivision corresponding to a first cleaning strategy and a second subdivision corresponding to a second cleaning strategy that is different from the first cleaning strategy.
11. The computer-implemented method of claim 8, wherein the plurality of cleaning strategies comprises a deep cleaning strategy control state and a quick cleaning strategy control state, wherein: responsive to selection of the deep cleaning strategy control state, the user terminal commands the remote cleaning robot to execute a relatively higher cumulative energy cleaning strategy; and responsive to selection of the quick cleaning strategy control state, the user terminal commands the remote cleaning robot to execute a relatively lower cumulative energy cleaning strategy.
12. The computer-implemented method of claim 11, wherein the relatively lower cumulative energy cleaning strategy includes the cleaning robot concentrating its cleaning in open areas and/or in designated areas.
13. The computer-implemented method of claim 11, wherein the relatively higher cumulative energy cleaning strategy includes the cleaning robot concentrating its cleaning on edges and corners of a living space.
