METHOD AND DEVICE FOR ENCODING IMAGE ACCORDING TO LOW-QUALITY CODING MODE, AND METHOD AND DEVICE FOR DECODING MAGE
</title>

<abstract>
Provided is a method of decoding an image, the method including determining at least one reference region to be referenced by a target region in the image to which a low-quality coding mode is applied; extracting a certain type of information from the determined at least one reference region; and changing pixel values of the target region, based on the extracted type of information.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of decoding an image, the method comprising: determining at least one reference region to be referenced by a target region in the image to which a low-quality coding mode is applied; extracting a certain type of information from the determined at least one reference region; and changing pixel values of the target region, based on the extracted type of information.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the type of information comprises a certain type of reference texture feature, and the changing of the pixel values of the target region comprises changing the pixel values of the target region such that a type of target texture feature of the target region is the same as or similar to the reference texture feature.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the changing of the pixel values of the target region comprises changing the pixel values of the target region by applying the target region and the at least one reference region to a machine learning model.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising, before changing the pixel values of the target region, reconstructing the target region encoded at low quality, based on information obtained from a bitstream.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising, before changing the pixel values of the target region, post-processing the reconstructed target region.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the post-processing of the reconstructed target region comprises post-processing the reconstructed target region by at least one of up-sampling or high-pass filtering.
7. The method of claim 4, wherein the reconstructing of the target region comprises: reconstructing the reference region by obtaining, from the bitstream, information generated as a result of encoding a reference region included in an original image; and reconstructing the target region by obtaining, from the bitstream, information generated as a result of encoding a target region included in a low-quality image corresponding to the original image.
8. The method of claim 2, further comprising, when the determined at least one reference region includes a plurality of reference regions, identifying types of reference texture features to be extracted from the plurality of reference regions, and wherein the extracting of the certain type of information comprises extracting the identified types of reference texture features from the plurality of reference regions, and the changing of the pixel values of the target region comprises changing the pixel values of the target region such that target texture features of the target region corresponding to the identified types of reference texture features are the same as or similar to the extracted reference texture features.
9. A method of encoding an image, the method comprising: determining at least one reference region to be referenced by a target region in a first image to which a low-quality coding mode is to be applied; encoding the target region at low quality; and generating a bitstream to include information generated as a result of encoding the target region and information indicating the at least one reference region.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the encoding of the target region at low quality comprises: pre-processing the target region of the first image, based on at least one of down-sampling, low-pass filtering, or pixel-value filtering; and encoding the pre-processed target region according to at least one of an intra mode, an inter mode, a skip mode, or a merge mode.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the encoding of the target region at low quality comprises encoding the target region according to at least one of an intra mode, an inter mode, or a merge mode, based on a quantization parameter larger than a quantization parameter of regions other than the target region and the reference region of the first image.
12. The method of claim 9, wherein the encoding of the target region at low quality comprises: obtaining a second image of lower quality than the quality of the first image; determining a region in the second image corresponding to the target region of the first image; and encoding the determined region of the second image.
13. The method of claim 9, further comprising encoding the at least one reference region at high quality, and wherein the generating of the bitstream comprises generating the bitstream to additionally include information generated as a result of encoding the at least one reference region and information related to the encoding of the at least one reference region at high quality.
14. An image decoding device comprising: a processor; and a memory storing at least one instruction, wherein the processor is configured to execute the at least one instruction to: determine at least one reference region to be referenced by a target region in an image to which a low-quality coding mode is applied; extract a certain type of information from the determined at least one reference region; and change pixel values of the target region, based on the extracted type of information.
15. An image encoding device comprising: a processor; and a memory storing at least one instruction, wherein the processor is configured to execute the at least one instruction to: determine at least one reference region to be referenced by a target region in a first image to which a low-quality coding mode is to be applied; encode the target region at low quality; and generate a bitstream to include information generated as a result of encoding the target region and information indicating the at least one reference region.
