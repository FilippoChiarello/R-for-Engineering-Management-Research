<title>
PCA-BASED SCORING OF THE SIMILARITY OF DAMAGE PATTERNS OF OPERATIONAL ASSETS
</title>

<abstract>
In some implementations, there is provided a method, which includes transforming, by the recommendation system, a first data set into the principal component analysis domain; rotating, by the recommendation system, the transformed first data first data set into a common axis system; comparing, by the recommendation system, the rotated, transformed first data set to at least one of a plurality of reference data sets having been rotated into the common axis system; and identifying, by the recommendation system, at least one reference data set, the identifying based on the comparing. Related systems, methods, and articles of manufacture are also disclosed.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: transforming, by a recommendation system, a first data set into the principal component analysis domain; rotating, by the recommendation system, the transformed first data first data set into a common axis system; comparing, by the recommendation system, the rotated, transformed first data set to at least one of a plurality of reference data sets having been rotated into the common axis system; and identifying, by the recommendation system, at least one reference data set, the identifying based on the comparing.
2. The method of claim 1 further comprising: outputting, by the recommendation system, at least one recommendation based on the identified at least one reference data set.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein the at least one reference data set is mapped to the at least one recommendation for a failure of an object being monitored by a sensor.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the at least one recommendation includes a score indicative of a condition of the object.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein a portion of the first data set is measured by the sensor.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein the sensor comprises an Internet of Things sensor including a wireless transceiver for transmitting at least the portion of the first data set to the recommendation system.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the common axis system comprises an axis system of the first data set prior to the transforming.
8. The method of claim 6, wherein the rotating comprises rotating the transformed first data first data set by an angle in accordance with the axis system of the first data set prior to the transforming.
9. The method of claim 1 further comprising: receiving, at a recommendation system, the first data set representing sensor data measuring at least one aspect of an object.
10. The method of claim 1 further comprising: receiving at least one data value measured by a sensor monitoring an object; transforming the at least one data value into the principal component analysis domain of the first data set; rotating the transformed at least one data value into the common axis system; comparing the rotated, transformed at least one data value to the plurality of reference data sets; and identifying, based on the comparing, the at least one reference data set mapped to at least one recommendation to remedy a failure of the object being monitored by the sensor.
11. A system comprising: at least one processor and at least one memory including program code which when executed by the at least one processor causes operations comprising: transforming a first data set into the principal component analysis domain; rotating the transformed first data first data set into a common axis system; comparing the rotated, transformed first data set to at least one of a plurality of reference data sets having been rotated into the common axis system; and identifying at least one reference data set, the identifying based on the comparing.
12. The system of claim 11 further comprising: outputting at least one recommendation based on the identified at least one reference data set.
13. The system of claim 12 wherein the at least one reference data set is mapped to the at least one recommendation for a failure of an object being monitored by a sensor.
14. The system of claim 12, wherein the at least one recommendation includes a score indicative of a condition of the object.
15. The system of claim 12, wherein a portion of the first data set is measured by the sensor.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the sensor comprises an Internet of Things sensor including a wireless transceiver for transmitting at least the portion of the first data set to the recommendation system.
17. The system of claim 11, wherein the common axis system comprises an axis system of the first data set prior to the transforming.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the rotating comprises rotating the transformed first data first data set by an angle in accordance with the axis system of the first data set prior to the transforming.
19. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium including program code which when executed caused operations comprising: transforming a first data set into the principal component analysis domain; rotating the transformed first data first data set into a common axis system; comparing the rotated, transformed first data set to at least one of a plurality of reference data sets having been rotated into the common axis system; and identifying at least one reference data set, the identifying based on the comparing.
20. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 19 further comprising: outputting at least one recommendation based on the identified at least one reference data set.
