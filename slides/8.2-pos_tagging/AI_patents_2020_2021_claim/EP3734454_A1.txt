MEMORY MAPPED VIRTUAL DOORBELL MECHANISM
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus to facilitate doorbell notifications is disclosed. The apparatus includes memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) base address registers including a physical function (PF) and plurality of virtual functions (VF), wherein each function's base address register comprises a plurality of doorbell pages and doorbell hardware including doorbell registers, each having an assignable function identifier (ID) and offset, and comprising a plurality of doorbells to activate a doorbell notification in response to receiving a doorbell trigger from an associated doorbell page set upon detection of an access request.

<claims>
1. An apparatus to facilitate doorbell notifications, comprising: memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) base address registers including a physical function (PF) and a plurality of virtual function (VF) register sets each associated with a VF, wherein each register set comprises a plurality of doorbell pages; and doorbell hardware including doorbell registers, each having an assignable function identifier (ID) and comprising a plurality of doorbells to activate a doorbell notification in response to receiving a doorbell trigger from an associated doorbell page set upon detection of an access request.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein a doorbell trigger comprises an offset and a function number.
3. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the function number is compared to the function ID and the offset is compared to each of the plurality of doorbells.
4. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein a doorbell notification is activated at a first of the plurality of doorbells upon a determination that the offset matches the doorbell and the function number matches the function ID.
5. The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the doorbell hardware further comprises a status vector register associated with each doorbell register to record which doorbell has been activated.
6. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein a status vector register records a doorbell notification.
7. The apparatus of claim 6, further comprising a scheduler to receive a doorbell notification and schedule an action associated with a doorbell notification.
8. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein the scheduler accesses a status vector register to retrieve a doorbell notification.
9. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the scheduler clears a status vector register after retrieving doorbell notification.
10. A method to facilitate doorbell notifications, comprising: receiving a doorbell trigger at a first of a plurality of doorbell registers having an assignable function identifier; determining whether the doorbell trigger matches the associated function and one of a plurality of doorbells; and activating a doorbell notification upon a determination that the doorbell trigger matches the function and one of the plurality of doorbells.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising: recording the doorbell notification at a status vector register associated with the doorbell register; and transmitting the doorbell notification.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising: receiving the doorbell notification at a scheduler; and scheduling an action associated with the doorbell.
13. The method of claim 11, further comprising the scheduler clearing the status vector register after retrieving the doorbell notification.
14. At least one computer readable medium having instructions, which when executed by one or more processors, cause the processors to perform a method as claimed in any of claims 10-13.
