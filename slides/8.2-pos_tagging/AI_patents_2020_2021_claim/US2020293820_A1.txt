<title>
OBJECT DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION
</title>

<abstract>
An embodiment of the invention may include a method, computer program product and computer system for object detection and identification. The method, computer program product and computer system may include computing device which may receive an image from a user device. The image may be a screenshot captured by the user device from a display. The computing device may classify the image based on features present in the image and detect a salient object contained within the image. The computing device may identify the object in the image and one or more sources of the object in the image.

<claims>
1. A method for object detection and identification, the method comprising: receiving, by a computing device, an image from a user device, wherein the image is screenshot captured by the user device from a display; classifying, by the computing device, the image, wherein the image is classified based on features present in the image; detecting, by the computing device, an object contained within the image, wherein the object is a salient object; identifying, by the computing device, the object in the image; and identifying, by the computing device, one or more sources of the object in the image.
2. A method as in claim 1, wherein identifying, by the computing device, one or more sources of the object in the image further comprises: determining, by the computing device, a location of the user device; generating, by the computing device, a list of sources of the object based on the location of the user device; and presenting, by the computing device, the list of sources of the object to a user on the user device, thereby allowing the user to compare respective conditions and locations for each of the objects.
3. A method as in claim 1, further comprising: receiving, by the computing device, a second image, the second image being an image of the user, from the user device; and generating, by the computing device, a second image of the user with the object, wherein the second image is generated using at least one convolutional neural network.
4. A method as in claim 1, further comprising: receiving, by the computing device, a request to acquire the object from the user device from one of the one or more sources; verifying, by the computer device, the request to acquire the object; and sending, by the computer device, the request to acquire the object to the source.
5. The method as in claim 1, wherein the screenshot is captured from the display displaying at least one of the group consisting of: a movie, a television program, and a commercial.
6. The method as in claim 1, wherein the object is detected using a saliency detection algorithm.
7. The method as in claim 1, wherein the object is identified using multi-modal learning techniques, the multi-modal learning techniques comprising at least one of the group consisting of: a neural network, a convolutional neural network (CNN), a background subtraction technique, a k-means algorithm, a Barnes-Hut approximation, and a t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).
8. The method as in claim 4, wherein the request to acquire the object is verified using a biometric sensor on the user device.
