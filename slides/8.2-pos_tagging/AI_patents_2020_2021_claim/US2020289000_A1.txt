TOILET WITH VASCULAR HEALTH REPORTING
</title>

<abstract>
A system for providing a report on vascular health of a user is disclosed. The system includes a toilet with a bowl adapted to receive excreta from the user and a processor. The toilet includes a seat with weight and PPG sensors. BCG data is derived from the weight sensor data. PPG data is derived from the PPG sensor. The processor performs a comparison of the data from the weight sensor and the data from the PPG sensor and preexisting data in a database. The processor then generates a report on the user's vascular health based on the comparison.

<claims>
1. A system for providing a report on vascular health of a user comprising: a toilet with a bowl adapted to receive excreta from the user; a seat to receive weight from the user wherein the seat comprises: a weight sensor to detect a portion of the user's weight and apparent fluctuations of the user's weight, which data is used in deriving BCG data for the user; a PPG sensor to detect PPG data pertaining to vascular properties of the user; a processor that performs a comparison of the data from the weight sensor and the data from the PPG sensor and preexisting data in a database; and wherein the processor generates a report on the user's vascular health based on the comparison.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the report is used in providing the user with information about the user's vascular health or a prompt to seek additional health or wellness care.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the report is used to prompt a user to seek additional health or wellness care.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the report is used in providing a heath or wellness provider with information about the user's vascular health.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the report is electronically stored as a reference for future vascular health comparison.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the preexisting data is based on data from relevant populations.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the preexisting data is the derived from the user's previous vascular health data.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein data regarding the user's vascular health is used in calculating an average, mean, or trend to create a baseline about the user's vascular health for that set of data; and the baseline is used as a reference to identify changes of the user relative to the baseline.
9. The system of claim 1, further comprising a second PPG sensor to detect secondary PPG data, wherein the PPG sensor is on the user's left hand side of the seat, the second PPG sensor is on the user's right hand side of the seat, the PPG data and the secondary PPG data are independently collected, and asymmetricallity between the PPG data and secondary PPG data is also used to generate the report.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein waveform image recognition analysis is performed on the BCG data or the PPG data; the processor is part of a neural net; results from waveform image recognition analysis are run through the neural net and compared to the preexisting data; the neural net outputs comparison data relative to the user's relative vascular health; and the processor uses the comparison data in generating the report.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein data from the PPG sensor is used in deriving a blood oxygen level for the user.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein the toilet further comprises a urine sensor.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the urine sensor monitors the volume of urine deposited in the bowl and is used to derive a user's urine flow.
14. The system of claim 12, wherein the urine sensor monitors the volume of urine deposited in the bowl and is used to derive a user's total urine volume deposited.
15. The system of claim 11, wherein data from the urine sensor is used to detect a ratio of albumin to creatinine in the urine.
16. The system of claim 12, wherein data from the urine sensor is used to detect myoglobin and troponin.
17. The system of claim 12, wherein data from the urine sensor is used to detect in the urine at least one of sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, phosphorus, and urea.
18. The system of claim 1, further comprising ECG leads to generate ECG data for the user.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein waveform image recognition analysis is performed on the ECG data; the processor is part of a neural net; results from the waveform image recognition analysis are run through the neural net and compared to the preexisting data; the neural net outputs comparison data relative to the user's relative vascular health; and the processor uses the comparison data in generating the report.
20. The system of claim 1, further comprising an additional weight sensor, data from which is combine with data from the seat's weight sensor to create weight data; wherein weight data includes a total weight for the user and is also used to generate the report.
21. The system of claim 1, wherein the height of the user is also used to generate the report.
22. The system of claim 1, wherein BCG data, PPG data, and the height of the user are used in determining a PWV, which is also used to generate the report.
23. The system of claim 1, wherein the user's BMI is also used to generate the report.
24. The system of claim 1, further comprising a bioimpedance sensor that generates bioimpedance data that is useful in determining body composition, and wherein bioimpedance data is also used to generate the report.
25. The system of claim 1, wherein the toilet further comprises a microphone for detecting audio signals relevant to cardiac functions of the user, which signals are also used to generate the report.
26. The system of claim 1, further comprising a durometer to test the user's skin hardness, wherein data from the durometer is also used to generate the report.
