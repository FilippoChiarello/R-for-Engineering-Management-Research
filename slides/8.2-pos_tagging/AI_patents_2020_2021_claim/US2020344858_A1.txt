TEMPORALLY MODULATED LIGHTING SYSTEM AND METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
Electric light sources typically exhibit temporal variations in luminous flux output, commonly referred to as "flicker." Flicker, or temporal modulation, is known to influence the growth, health and behavior patterns of humans, and is also linked to growth, health and behavior patterns throughout the growth cycle of plants and animals. Control of peak radiant flux emitted by a light source to temporally modulate a light source will allow for the control of plants and animals for sustainable farming including but not limited to horticultural, agricultural, or aquacultural endeavors. The light source allows the transmission of daylight, which is combined with the flicker.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A system for optimizing health of a plant comprising: a glazing unit having: an outer pane; an inner pane parallel to and spaced apart from the outer pane; an array of light-emitting elements (LEEs) mounted on an inner side of the outer pane; and electrical conductors adhered to the inner side of the outer pane and connected to the LEEs; a sensor that detects a health parameter of the plant; and a controller connected via the electrical conductors to the LEEs, wherein the controller: controls the LEEs to provide flicker that has a peak radiant flux, an average radiant flux, a duty factor and a pulse frequency, wherein the plant is exposed to the flicker; incorporates a signal from the sensor into a closed loop feedback system; and adjusts, based on the detected health parameter: the peak radiant flux and the duty factor, without adjusting the pulse frequency and the average radiant flux; or the pulse frequency, without adjusting the peak radiant flux, the duty factor and the average radiant flux; wherein said adjustment maintains the health parameter of the plant within predetermined limits.
2. The system of claim 1 wherein the inner pane transmits light that has passed through the outer pane and light that is emitted from the LEEs.
3. The system of claim 1 wherein the outer pane and the inner pane are soda-lime glass or borosilicate glass.
4. The system of claim 1 wherein the electrical conductors are substantially transparent.
5. The system of claim 1 wherein the outer pane and the inner pane are polymethyl methacrylate.
6. The system of claim 1 wherein a space between the outer pane and the inner pane is filled with air or argon.
7. The system of claim 1 wherein a space between the outer pane and the inner pane is filled with liquid.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the liquid is water.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein the liquid is mineral spirits.
10. The system of claim 7, wherein the liquid is flowing.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the inner pane is an optical diffuser.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the optical diffuser comprises a transparent substrate with a textured surface.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the optical diffuser comprises a material with embedded diffusing particles.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the diffusing particles are luminophores.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the luminophores are fluorophores, phosphors or quantum dots that have a decay time shorter than an off-cycle of the flicker.
16. The system of claim 1, further comprising a holographic diffuser on an inner surface of the inner pane.
17. The system of claim 1, wherein the LEEs are micro light emitting diodes.
18. The system of claim 1 wherein: the controller is connected to the LEEs via a current driver: the controller provides a modulated first frequency signal for controlling the peak radiant flux; the controller provides a modulated second frequency signal for controlling the average radiant flux; the second frequency is lower than the first frequency and superimposed on the first frequency; and the current driver provides current modulated with the superimposed first and second frequencies to the glazing unit.
19. A method for optimizing health of a plant comprising: providing the plant; exposing the plant to flicker from a glazing unit having: an outer pane; an inner pane parallel to and spaced apart from the outer pane; an array of light-emitting elements (LEEs) mounted on an inner side of the outer pane; and electrical conductors adhered to the inner side of the outer pane and connected to the LEEs; wherein the flicker has a peak radiant flux, an average radiant flux, a duty factor and a pulse frequency, wherein the plant is exposed to the flicker; detecting a health parameter of the plant; and adjusting, based on the detected health parameter: the peak radiant flux and the duty factor, without adjusting the pulse frequency and the average radiant flux; or the pulse frequency, without adjusting the peak radiant flux, the duty factor and the average radiant flux; wherein said adjustment maintains the health parameter of the plant within predetermined limits.
20. The method of claim 19 comprising: providing, by a first current driver, a modulated first frequency signal for controlling the peak radiant flux; and providing, by a second current driver, a modulated second frequency signal for controlling the average radiant flux; wherein the second frequency is lower than the first frequency and superimposed on the first frequency.
