<claims>
1. 1-157. (canceled)
158. An isolated antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, that binds to a C10orf 54 protein, wherein the antibody is the antibody 230A, comprising: a heavy chain variable domain comprising the following three CDRs, respectively CDR-H1 having the sequence SEQ ID NO: 1302, CDR-H2 having the sequence SEQ ID NO: 1365 and CDR-H3 having the sequence SEQ ID NO: 1402, and a light chain variable domain comprising the following three CDRs, respectively CDR-L1 having the sequence SEQ ID NO: 1455, CDR-L2 having the sequence SEQ ID NO: 1103 and CDR-L3 having the sequence SEQ ID NO: 1505.
159. The isolated antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of claim 158, wherein the antibody comprises a heavy chain variable domain comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1271, and a light chain variable domain comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1272.
160. The antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of claim 158, wherein the antibody is a monoclonal antibody.
161. The antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of claim 158, wherein the antibody is humanized.
162. The antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of claim 158, wherein the antibody is a Fab fragment, a F(abâ€²)2 fragment, a single chain Fv (sFv), a diabody, a triabody, or a minibody.
163. The antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of claim 158, wherein the antibody is conjugated or recombinantly fused to a detectable agent.
164. The antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of claim 163, wherein the detectable agent is selected from the group consisting of an enzyme, a fluorescent compound, a bioluminescent compound, a chemiluminescent compound, a radioisotope, a prosthetic group, a positron emitting metal, and a non-radioactive paramagnetic metal ion.
165. The antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of claim 164, wherein the enzyme is selected from the group consisting of horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, and acetylcholinesterase, the fluorescent compound is selected from the group consisting of umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocynate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride and phycoerythrin, the bioluminescent compound is selected from the group consisting of luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin, the chemiluminescent compound is luminol, or the radioisotope is selected from the group consisting of 131I, 125I, 123I, 121I, 14C, 35S, 3H, 115In, 113In, 112In, 111In, 99Tc, 201Ti, 68Ga, 67Ga, 103Pd, 99Mo, 133Xe, 18F, 153Sm, 177Lu, 159Gd, 149Pm, 140La, 175Yb, 166Ho, 90Y, 47Sc, 186Re, 188Re, 142Pr, 105Rh, 97Ru, 68Ge, 57Co, 65Zn, 85Sr, 32P, 153Gd, 169Yb, 51Cr, 54Mn, 75Se, 113Sn, and 117Sn.
166. A polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of claim 158.
167. An expression vector comprising the polynucleotide of claim 166.
168. An isolated host cell comprising the expression vector of claim 167.
169. A method of producing the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of claim 158, the method comprising a step of culturing an isolated host cell comprising an expression vector comprising a polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of claim 158 under conditions that promote the production of the antibody.
170. An in vitro method for detecting a C10orf 54 protein in a sample comprising contacting the sample with the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of claim 158.
171. An in vitro method of detecting a C10orf 54-mediated disease in a subject comprising: (a) assaying the level of a C10orf 54 antigen in cells or a tissue sample of a subject using the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of claim 158, and (b) comparing the level of the C10orf 54 antigen with a control level of the antigen, wherein an increase in the assayed C10orf 54 antigen level as compared to the control level of the C10orf 54 antigen is indicative of a C10orf 54-mediated disease.
172. The method of claim 171, wherein assaying the level of C10orf 54 antigen is determined by a method selected from the group consisting of: an immunohistochemistry assay, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a radioimmunoassay (RIA), and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).
173. An in vitro method of monitoring a C10orf 54-mediated disease comprising repeating the method of claim 171 one month, six months, or one year after initial diagnosis of the C10orf 54-mediated disease.
174. The method of claim 171 wherein the C10orf 54-mediated disease is a cell proliferative disorder, a cancer, a tumor, or graft-versus-host disease.
175. A kit comprising the antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of claim 158.
176. The kit of claim 175, further comprising a substantially isolated C10orf 54 antigen.
177. The kit of claim 176, wherein the C10orf 54 antigen is attached to a solid support.
