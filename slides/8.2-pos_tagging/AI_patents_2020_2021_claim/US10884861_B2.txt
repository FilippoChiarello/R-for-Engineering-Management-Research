<title>
Write-balanced parity assignment within a cluster
</title>

<abstract>
According to one embodiment, a computer-implemented method includes determining a write speed for each of a plurality of systems in a cluster, determining a ratio of the write speeds for each of the plurality of systems in the cluster, and updating parity assignments to each of the plurality of systems in the cluster, based on the ratio of the write speeds.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method, comprising: determining a write speed for each of a plurality of systems in a cluster; determining a ratio of the write speeds for each of the plurality of systems in the cluster; and updating parity assignments to each of the plurality of systems in the cluster, based on the ratio of the write speeds.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein each of the plurality of systems includes a data storage system.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein data is written to the plurality of systems asynchronously.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein an erasure code for the cluster is log based.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein an erasure code for the cluster is block based.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the write speed for each of the plurality of systems indicates an amount of data received by and written to the system over a predetermined period of time.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein each system includes a first volume for storing received data, and a second volume for storing cluster parity data.
8. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein at least one volume of each system is thin provisioned.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein a parity of the cluster is thin provisioned.
10. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the write speed is predicted for one or more of the plurality of systems in the cluster.
11. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the updated parity assignments are based on a ratio of parity data to be written to each of the plurality of systems, that includes a ratio of parity data to be calculated by each of the plurality of systems and written to storage portions of the systems.
12. The computer-implemented method of claim 11, wherein the ratio of parity data to be written to each of the plurality of systems is based on the ratio of the write speeds.
13. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the write speed for each of the plurality of systems in the cluster is determined by monitoring the plurality of systems.
14. The computer-implemented method of claim 13, wherein the monitoring is performed according to a schedule.
15. The computer-implemented method of claim 13, wherein the monitoring is performed in response to identifying that a predetermined amount of data has been transferred to the cluster for storage.
16. The computer-implemented method of claim 13, wherein the monitoring is performed in response to identifying that a predetermined number of partial parity data computations have been performed by the plurality of systems in the cluster.
17. A computer program product for implementing a write-balanced parity assignment within a cluster, the computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, wherein the computer readable storage medium is not a transitory signal per se, the program instructions executable by a processor to cause the processor to perform a method comprising: determining, by the processor, a write speed for each of a plurality of systems in the cluster; determining, by the processor, a ratio of the write speeds for each of the plurality of systems in the cluster; and updating, by the processor, parity assignments to each of the plurality of systems in the cluster, based on the ratio of the write speeds.
18. The computer program product of claim 17, wherein each of the plurality of systems includes a data storage system.
19. The computer program product of claim 17, wherein data is written to the plurality of systems asynchronously.
20. A system, comprising: a processor; and logic integrated with the processor, executable by the processor, or integrated with and executable by the processor, the logic being configured to: determine a write speed for each of a plurality of systems in a cluster; determine a ratio of the write speeds for each of the plurality of systems in the cluster; and update parity assignments to each of the plurality of systems in the cluster, based on the ratio of the write speeds.
