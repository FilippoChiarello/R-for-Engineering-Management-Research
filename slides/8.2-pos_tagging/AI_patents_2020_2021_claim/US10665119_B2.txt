<title>
Gaze based classroom notes generator
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques are provided for creating presentation notes based upon gaze tracking information associated with observers of a presentation. In one example, a computer-implemented method comprises: obtaining, by a system operatively coupled to a processor, gaze information associated with observers of a presentation; determining, by the system, respective content clarity scores for content elements of the presentation based on a content clarity function; selecting, by the system, respective content from one or more content sources for the content elements based on the respective content clarity scores; and generating, by the system, presentation notes based on the presentation and the selected respective content for the content elements of the presentation.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method, comprising: obtaining, by a system including one or more processors, gaze information associated with observers of a presentation; determining, by the system, respective attention scores for content elements of the presentation based on the gaze information, wherein the determining comprises determining an attention score for a content element of the content elements based on an attention function that employs a cluster average of saccade paths for the content element determined based on the gaze information, wherein the cluster average of saccade paths comprises a set of respective representative saccade paths for clusters of saccade paths associated with the content element; determining, by the system, respective content clarity scores for content elements of the presentation based on a content clarity function and the gaze information, wherein the content clarity function employs the attention score for the content element; selecting, by the system, respective content, from one or more content sources, for the content elements based on the respective content clarity scores; and generating, by the system, presentation notes based on the presentation and the selected respective content for the content elements of the presentation.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising controlling, by the system, a device associated with an observer to display the presentation notes as the observer is reviewing the presentation.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the attention function further employs one or more statistics selects from a group consisting of a total fixation duration for the content element, a number of fixations for the content element, an average fixation duration for the content element, and a percentage viewing time for the content element.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising obtaining, by the system, respective importance levels for the content elements, wherein the content clarity function further employs an importance level for the content element.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising obtaining, by the system, respective effort levels for the content elements, wherein the content clarity function further employs an effort level for the content element.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising obtaining, by the system, a heuristic for the content element, wherein the content clarity function further employs the heuristic for the content element.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising determining, by the system, the content clarity function based upon a deep learning model that is optimized for learning for a particular topic of the presentation.
