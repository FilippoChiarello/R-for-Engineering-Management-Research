INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD, DEVICE AND ELECTRONIC APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
An information processing method includes detecting a specified input directed to one or more members of a current chat group, determining the one or more members directed to by the specified input as target members, and sending private content to the target members, where the private content is not visible by other members of the current chat group.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An information processing method, comprising: detecting a specified input directed to one or more members of a current chat group; determining the one or more members directed to by the specified input as target members; and sending private content to the target members, wherein the private content is not visible by other members of the current chat group.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: displaying the private content in the current chat group to the target members and not to the other members of the current chat group.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: entering, by the target members, a private mode, wherein in the private mode, a content sent to the current chat group is visible by a sender of the private content and the target members.
4. The method of claim 2, further comprising: receiving the private content sent by a member of the current chat group; selecting members from the target members or re-selecting members from the current chat group; and sending a response to prompt to the selected members.
5. The method of claim 2, further comprising: when receiving the private content sent by a member of the current chat group, entering a private mode, wherein in the private mode, a content sent to the current chat group is visible to members who can see the private content, until the members exit the private mode.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: creating a temporary conversation including a sender and the target members; and sending the private content and causing the private content to be displayed at an interface of the temporary conversation.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein a display of the private content is different from a display of other content of the chat group.
8. An electronic apparatus for information processing, comprising: a detection circuit, configured to detect a specified input by a sender, directed to one or more members of a current chat group and determine the one or more members directed to by the specified input as target members; and a transmitting circuit, configured to send private content to the target members, wherein the private content is not visible by other members of the current chat group.
9. The electronic apparatus for information processing of claim 8, further comprising: a first controller, configured to place the target members into a private mode, wherein in the private mode, the private content is visible by the sender of the private content and the target members; a selection circuit, configured to, when receiving the private content, identify members from the target members or re-select members from the current chat group to send a response; a second controller, configured to, when receiving the private content, enter the private mode; and a creation circuit, configured to create a temporary conversation including the sender and the target members.
10. The electronic apparatus for information processing of claim 9, wherein the transmitting circuit is further configured to display the private content in the current chat group to the target members and not to the other members of the current chat group.
11. The electronic apparatus for information processing of claim 9, wherein the creation circuit is configured to create a temporary conversation to display the private content at an interface of the temporary conversation.
12. A computer-readable storage medium storing a computer program, when executed by one or more processors, the computer program causes the processors to perform a method of information processing, the method comprising: detecting a specified input directed to one or more members of a current chat group; determining the one or more members directed to by the specified input as target members; and sending private content to the target members, wherein the private content is not visible by other members of the current chat group.
13. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 12, the method further comprising: displaying the private content in the current chat group to the target members and not to the other members of the current chat group.
14. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, the method further comprising: entering, by target members, a private mode, wherein in the private mode, a content sent to the current chat group is visible by the senders of the private content and the target members.
15. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, the method further comprising: receiving the private content sent by a member of the current chat group; selecting members from the target members or re-selecting members from the current chat group; and sending a response to prompt to the selected members.
16. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, the method further comprising: when receiving the private content sent by a member of the current chat group, entering a private mode, wherein in the private mode, a content sent to the current chat group is visible to members, who can see the private content, until the members exit the private mode.
17. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 12, the method further comprising: creating a temporary conversation including a sender and the target members; and sending the private content to cause the private content to be displayed at an interface of the temporary conversation.
18. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein a display of the private content is different from a display of other content of the chat group.
