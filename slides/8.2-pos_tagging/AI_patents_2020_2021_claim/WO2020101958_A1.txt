</title>

<abstract>
A computer implemented method includes turning off a sensor, receiving fall curve data from the sensor, and comparing the received fall curve data to a set of fall curve signatures to identify the sensor or a sensor fault.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method comprising:
turning off a sensor;
receiving fall curve data from the sensor; and
comparing the received fall curve data to a set of fall curve signatures to identify the sensor or a sensor fault.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the sensor comprises a wireless sensor.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the set of fall curve signatures comprises fall curve signatures from sensors having one or more of the faults comprising short fault, spike fault, stuck-at fault.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein comparing the received fall curve data to a set of fall curve signatures to identify the sensor or a sensor fault is performed by the sensor comprising a digital sensor.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the fall curve data corresponds to an analog signal output from the sensor in response to turning off the sensor.
6. The method of claim 5 wherein the fall curve data comprises a time series sampling of the analog signal that is sampled periodically or in response to anomalous data received from the sensor prior to turning off the sensor.
7. The method of claim 6 wherein the set of fall curve signatures include fall curve signatures from properly operating sensors that are different for different types of sensors and fall curve signatures from faulty sensors that are different for different types of faults.
8. The method of any one of claims 1-7 wherein the fall curve data comprises a time series sampled analog output from the sensor in response to turning off the sensor and wherein comparing the received fall curve data comprises:
generating a feature vector for the time series sampled analog output; and comparing the feature vector with feature vectors corresponding to the set of fall curve signatures to match the generated feature vector with one of the feature vectors of the set of fall curve signatures.
9. The method of claim 8 wherein the feature vector is generated by:
fitting a polynomial curve to the time series sampled analog output;
using polynomial coefficients of the polynomial curve as the feature vector;
finding a nearest neighbor to the polynomial coefficients; and
identifying the sensor or sensor fault in response to the nearest neighbor being within a certain threshold.
10. The method of claim 9 wherein the hyper-parameters comprising fall curve width and polynomial degree are tuned to trade off accuracy based on resource and power constraints.
11. The method of claim 8 wherein the feature vectors corresponding to the set of fall curve signatures are generated by:
recording multiple fall curve signatures for multiple sensors and an ID for each of the multiple sensors;
fitting polynomial curves to the recorded signatures;
using polynomial coefficients of the polynomial curve as the feature vector; and performing clustering on the feature vectors for each sensor to identify a smaller set of unique features for each sensor.
12. The method of claim 11 and further comprising optimizing a set of hyper parameters comprising fall curve width, degree of polynomial, and number of clusters for the feature vectors.
13. A machine-readable storage device having instructions for execution by a processor of a machine to cause the processor to perform operations to perform a method of managing communication accounts, the operations comprising:
turning off a sensor;
receiving fall curve data from the sensor; and
comparing the received fall curve data to a set of fall curve signatures to identify the sensor or a sensor fault.
14. The device of claim 13 wherein the fall curve data comprises a time series sampled analog output from the sensor in response to turning off the sensor and wherein comparing the received fall curve data comprises:
generating a feature vector for the time series sampled analog output;
comparing the feature vector with feature vectors corresponding to the set of fall curve signatures to match the generated feature vector with one of the feature vectors of the set of fall curve signatures; and
wherein the feature vector is generated by:
fitting a polynomial curve to the timer series sampled analog output;
using polynomial coefficients of the polynomial curve as the feature vector;
finding a nearest neighbor to the polynomial coefficients; and
identifying the sensor or sensor fault in response to the nearest neighbor being within a certain threshold.
15. A device comprising:
a processor;
an analog sensor coupled to the processor; and
a memory device coupled to the processor and having a program stored thereon for execution by the processor to perform operations comprising:
turning off a sensor;
receiving fall curve data from the sensor; and
comparing the received fall curve data to a set of fall curve signatures to identify the sensor or a sensor fault.
