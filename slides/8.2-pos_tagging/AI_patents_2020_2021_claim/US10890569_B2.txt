<title>
Colorimetric sensor arrays based on nanoporous pigments
</title>

<abstract>
A colorimetric array includes a substrate, a first spot on the substrate, and a second spot on the substrate. The first spot includes a first nanoporous pigment that includes a first nanoporous material and a first immobilized, chemoresponsive colorant. The second spot includes a second nanoporous pigment that includes a second nanoporous material and a second immobilized, chemoresponsive colorant. The first nanoporous pigment is different from the second nanoporous pigment.

<claims>
1. A method of making a colorimetric array comprising: depositing a first liquid at a first point on a substrate; depositing a second liquid at a second point on the substrate; converting the first liquid into a first spot on the substrate; and converting the second liquid into a second spot on the substrate, wherein the first spot comprises a first nanoporous pigment and a first immobilized, chemoresponsive colorant and the second spot includes the second nanoporous pigment and a second immobilized, chemoresponsive colorant, wherein the first and second liquids further comprise at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of a nanoporous material precursor for the first nanoporous pigment, a nanoporous material precursor for the second nanoporous pigment, a solvent, an oxidant, a reductant, a catalyst, additive and a surfactant, or a combination thereof, wherein the first and second liquids are each formed according to the following process: combining a precursor for an organically modified silica, a solvent, a nanoporous material precursor for the first or second nanoporous pigment and the first or second chemoresponsive colorant to form a mixture; and hydrolyzing the mixture to form a sol.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first and second nanoporous pigments are the same, and the first and second immobilized, chemoresponsive colorants are different.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the first and second nanoporous pigments are different, and the first and second immobilized, chemoresponsive colorants are the same.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the first and second nanoporous pigments are different, and the first and second immobilized, chemoresponsive colorants are different.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the substrate comprises a polymeric membrane.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the polymeric membrane is selected from the group consisting of cellulose acetate, polysulfone, polypropylene, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, glass, metal, poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) and poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET).
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the first and second liquids comprise nanoporous material precursors for the first and second nanoporous pigments, respectively and first and second immobilized chemoresponsive colorants, respectively.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the nanoporous material precursors for the first and second nanoporous pigments are selected from the group consisting of a polymer, a prepolymer, a precursor for an organically modified silica and a ceramic, or a combination thereof.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the nanoporous material precursors for the first and second nanoporous pigments comprise a precursor material for an organically modified silica that has been at least partially hydrolyzed.
10. The method of claim 7, wherein the steps of converting the first and second liquids into the first and second spots on the substrate, respectively, comprises solidifying the nanoporous material precursors for the first and second nanoporous pigments, respectively.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein solidifying the nanoporous material precursors comprises condensing the nanoporous material precursors to form nanoporous gels or organically modified silicas.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein the solidifying comprises heating the first and second liquids between 10 C to 30 C from 24 to 72 hours or curing the substrate at a temperature between 10 C to 30 C from 24 to 72 hours.
