ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
An artificial intelligence device according to an embodiment of the present invention may include a microphone configured to receive voice; a sound output unit configured to output sound; an artificial intelligence unit configured to acquire context information of a target, based on at least one of an image received from a camera disposed outside and a voice received from the microphone, generate feedback information according to the acquired context information, and determine output volume intensity of the generated feedback information; and a controller configured to control the sound output unit to output the feedback information at the determined output volume intensity.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An artificial intelligence device comprising: a microphone configured to receive voice; a sound output unit configured to output sound; an artificial intelligence unit configured to acquire context information of a target, based on at least one of an image received from a camera disposed outside and a voice received from the microphone, generate feedback information according to the acquired context information, and determine output volume intensity of the generated feedback information; and a controller configured to control the sound output unit to output the feedback information at the determined output volume intensity.
2. The artificial intelligence device of claim 1, wherein the context information of the target includes at least one of the attributes of the target, an action of the target, and a position of the target.
3. The artificial intelligence device of claim 2, wherein the artificial intelligence unit predicts the context of the target and generates the feedback information indicating a prediction result, using the context information of the target.
4. The artificial intelligence device of claim 3, wherein the artificial intelligence unit determines the output volume intensity of the feedback information to be less than the preset volume intensity, in a case where the intensity of the voice input through the microphone is less than a preset intensity.
5. The artificial intelligence device of claim 3, wherein the artificial intelligence unit determines the output volume intensity of the feedback information to be more than the preset volume intensity, in a case where the intensity of the voice input through the microphone is more than a preset intensity.
6. The artificial intelligence device of claim 1, wherein the artificial intelligence unit selects a target to be uttered by using the voice received through the microphone among the plurality of targets in a case where a plurality of targets are included in the image, and wherein the controller outputs the feedback information through the sound output unit in a direction of a selected target.
7. The artificial intelligence device of claim 1, further comprising: a short range communication module configured to perform short range communication with a mobile terminal of the target, wherein the feedback information includes a notification received by the mobile terminal.
8. The artificial intelligence device of claim 1, further comprising: a short range communication module configured to perform short range communication with a mobile terminal of the target, wherein the artificial intelligence unit determines an output method of the feedback information according to the context information of the target, and wherein the output method is a method of outputting the feedback information through any one of the short range communication module or the sound output unit.
9. An artificial intelligence device comprising: a short range communication module configured to perform short range communication with a mobile terminal of a target, a microphone configured to receive voice; a sound output unit configured to output sound; an artificial intelligence unit configured to acquire context information of a target, based on at least one of an image received from a camera disposed outside and a voice received from the microphone, generate feedback information according to the acquired context information, and determine any one of the short range communication module or the sound output unit with an output method of the generated feedback information; and a controller configured to control any one of the short range communication module or the sound output unit to output the feedback information in the determined output method.
10. The artificial intelligence device of claim 9, wherein the artificial intelligence unit transmits the feedback information in response to the voice received through the microphone to the mobile terminal through the short range communication module, in a case where the target does not exist in the image.
11. The artificial intelligence device of claim 9, wherein the artificial intelligence unit outputs the feedback information in response to the voice received through the microphone through the sound output unit in a case where the target exists in the image.
12. The artificial intelligence device of claim 9, wherein the context information of the target includes at least one of the attributes of the target, an action of the target, and a position of the target.
13. The artificial intelligence device of claim 12, wherein the artificial intelligence unit predicts the context of the target, using the context information of the target and generates the feedback information indicating a prediction result.
14. The artificial intelligence device of claim 13, wherein the artificial intelligence unit selects a target to be uttered by using the voice received through the microphone among the plurality of targets in a case where a plurality of targets are included in the image and outputs the feedback information through the sound output unit in a direction of a selected target.
15. The artificial intelligence device of claim 9, wherein the artificial intelligence unit generates emergency context information regardless of the context information of the target, in a case where a dangerous context of the target is detected, based on the image, and wherein the controller transmits the generated emergency context information to the mobile terminal through the short range communication module, and outputs the emergency context information as a sound having a preset volume intensity or more through the sound output unit.
