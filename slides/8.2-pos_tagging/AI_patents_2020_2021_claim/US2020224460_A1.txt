SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR AUTOMATED CAPTURE AND RECOVERY OF TAG AND TACK
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for operating a tag detacher. The methods comprise: receiving a tag body of a security device in a nest of the tag detacher; actuating a detachment mechanism of the tag detacher so as to cause a release of a tack assembly from a securement mechanism located within the tag body of the security device; allowing the tag body to travel out of a nest by at least rotating a portion of the nest so that the nest transitions between a home position and a pivoted position; and returning the nest to the home position when the tag body no longer resides in the nest.

<claims>
1. A method for operating a tag detacher, comprising: receiving a tag body of a security device in a nest of the tag detacher; actuating a detachment mechanism of the tag detacher so as to cause a release of a tack assembly from a securement mechanism located within the tag body of the security device; allowing the tag body to travel out of a nest by at least rotating a portion of the nest so that the nest transitions between a home position and a pivoted position; and returning the nest to the home position when the tag body no longer resides in the nest.
2. The method according to claim 1, further comprising determining, by the tag detacher, whether the tag body is properly placed in the nest, prior to an actuation of the detachment mechanism.
3. The method according to claim 2, further comprising outputting from the tag detacher a prompt for adjusting the tag body's position within the nest, when a determination is made that the tag body is not properly placed in the nest.
4. The method according to claim 2, further comprising actuating a latch mechanism to secure the tag body to the tag detacher, when a determination is made that the tag body is properly placed in the nest.
5. The method according to claim 1, further comprising performing operations by the tag detacher to determine whether there are any obstructions preventing access to the tack assembly, prior to an actuation of the detachment mechanism.
6. The method according to claim 5, further comprising outputting from the tag detacher a prompt for causing an individual to check for obstructions preventing access to the tack assembly, when a determination is made that there is an obstruction preventing access to the tack assembly.
7. The method according to claim 1, further comprising performing operations by the tag detacher to move a shield in proximity to the tack assembly, prior to an actuation of the detachment mechanism.
8. The method according to claim 7, further comprising using the shield to clamp an article to the tag detacher.
9. The method according to claim 8, further comprising performing operations by the tag detacher to move a shield out of proximity to the tack assembly, after the actuation of the detachment mechanism.
10. The method according to claim 1, further comprising performing capturing operations by the tag detacher to capture the tack assembly.
11. The method according to claim 10, wherein the capturing operations comprise actuating a mechanical device to grasp the tack assembly, generating a magnetic field to cause the tack assembly to be attracted to a magnetic surface, or operating a vacuum to collect the tack assembly.
12. The method according to claim 10, further comprising performing operations by the tag detacher to move the captured tack assembly over a storage container, and release the tack assembly so that the tack assembly travels into the storage container.
13. A tag detacher, comprising: a nest sized and shaped to receive a tag body of a security device; a detachment mechanism that is actuable so as to cause a release of a tack assembly from a securement mechanism located within the tag body of the security device; wherein at least a portion of the nest is transitionable between a home position in which the tag body is prevented from sliding or falling out of the nest and a pivoted position in which the tag body is allowed to slide or fall out of the nest; and wherein the nest is returned to the home position when the tag body no longer resides in the nest.
14. The tag detacher according to claim 13, further comprising at least one sensor that generates sensor data useful to determine whether the tag body is properly placed in the nest.
15. The tag detacher according to claim 14, further comprising an output device from which a prompt is output for adjusting the tag body's position within the nest, when a determination is made that the tag body is not properly placed in the nest.
16. The tag detacher according to claim 14, further comprising a latch mechanism that is actuable to secure the tag body to the tag detacher, when a determination is made that the tag body is properly placed in the nest.
17. The tag detacher according to claim 12, further comprising at least one sensor that generates sensor data useful to determine whether there are any obstructions preventing access to the tack assembly, prior to an actuation of the detachment mechanism.
18. The tag detacher according to claim 17, further comprising an output device from which a prompt is output for causing an individual to check for obstructions preventing access to the tack assembly, when a determination is made that there is an obstruction preventing access to the tack assembly.
19. The tag detacher according to claim 12, further comprising a shield that is moved in proximity to the tack assembly, prior to an actuation of the detachment mechanism.
20. The tag detacher according to claim 19, wherein the shield is used to clamp an article to the tag detacher.
21. The tag detacher according to claim 19, wherein the shield is moved out of proximity of the tack assembly, after the actuation of the detachment mechanism.
22. The tag detacher according to claim 12, further comprising a capturing unit that captures the tack assembly by grasping the tack assembly, generating a magnetic field to cause the tack assembly to be attracted to a magnetic surface, or operating a vacuum to collect the tack.
23. The tag detacher according to claim 22, wherein the tag detacher moves the captured tack assembly over a storage container, and releases the tack assembly so that the tack assembly travels into the storage container.
