METHODS OF SCALING COMPUTATIONAL GENOMICS WITH SPECIALIZED ARCHITECTURES FOR HIGHLY PARALLELIZED COMPUTATIONS AND USES THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosure relates to methods for increasing the speed and efficiency of computational genomics. In particular, the disclosure relates to methods of scaling computational genomics by using one or more specialized architectures for highly parallelized computations, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), tensor processing units (TPUs), and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and the like, to compute the computational genomics calculations.
