<title>
REFERENCE DISTANCE SIMILARITY SEARCH
</title>

<abstract>
A similarity search system includes a database of original vectors, a hierarchical database of bins and a similarity searcher. The hierarchical database of bins is stored in an associative memory array, each bin identified by an order vector representing at least one original vector and the dimension of the order vector is smaller than the dimension of the original vector. The similarity searcher searches in the database for at least one similar bin whose order vector resembles an order vector representing a query vector and provides at least one original vector represented by the bin resembling the query vector.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A similarity search system comprising: a database comprising a plurality of original vectors; a hierarchical database of bins stored in an associative memory array, each bin identified by an order vector representing at least one original vector, a dimension of said order vector smaller than a dimension of said original vector; and a similarity searcher to search in said database for at least one similar bin whose order vector resembles an order vector representing a query vector and to provide said at least one original vector represented by said bin, said original vector resembling said query vector.
2. The system of claim 1 wherein bins of said hierarchical database are stored in columns of said associative memory array and said similarity searcher operates simultaneously on a plurality of said columns.
3. The system of claim 2 wherein said hierarchical database is arranged in levels, each level stored in a different section of said associative memory array.
4. The system of claim 1 also comprising a hierarchical database builder to build said hierarchical database of bins from said database of original vectors.
5. The system of claim 4 wherein said hierarchical database builder comprises: a reference vector definer to define a set of reference vectors in a dimension of said original vectors; an order vector creator to compute for each original vector a distance to each reference vector and to create an order vector comprising IDs of said reference vectors ordered by their distance from said original vector; and a bin creator to create a bin identified by an order vector representing at least one original vector.
6. The system of claim 5 said hierarchical database builder also to cluster order vectors representing different original vectors sharing an order vector to a single bin.
7. The system of claim 1 wherein said hierarchical database comprises at least two levels, and wherein a bin in a level is associated with bins in a lower level.
8. The system of claim 7 wherein said similarity searcher to start said search in a first level of said hierarchical database and to continue with bins in a lower level associated with bins found in said first level.
9. A method for finding a set of vectors in a database of original vectors, said set of vectors similar to a query vector, the method comprising: having access to a set of reference vectors; creating a query order vector associated with said query vector using said reference vectors, a dimension of said query order vector smaller than a dimension of said query vector; and searching in a hierarchical database of bins stored in an associative memory array, each bin representing at least one original vector and identified by an order vector created using said set of reference vectors, at least one similar bin whose order vector resembles said query order vector; and providing said at least one original vector represented by said similar bin, said original vector resembling said query vector.
10. The method of claim 9 wherein said hierarchical database storing bins in columns of said associative memory array and said step of searching operates simultaneously on a plurality of said columns.
11. The method of claim 10 also arranging said hierarchical database in levels, each level in a different section of said associative memory array.
12. The method of claim 9 also comprising building said hierarchical database of bins from said database of original vectors.
13. The method of claim 12 wherein said step of building said hierarchical database comprises: defining said set of reference vectors in a dimension of said original vectors; computing for each original vector a distance to each reference vector and creating an order vector comprising IDs of said reference vectors ordered by their distance from said original vector; and a bin creator to create a bin identified by an order vector representing at least one original vector.
14. The method of claim 13 also comprising clustering order vectors representing different original vectors sharing an order vector to a single bin.
15. The method of claim 9 wherein said hierarchical database comprises at least two levels, and wherein a bin in a level is associated with bins in a lower level.
16. The method of claim 15 wherein said step of searching comprises starting in a first level of said hierarchical database and continuing with bins in a lower level associated with bins found in said first level.
