METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR MAPPING AND LOCALIZATION FOR A VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided for controlling a vehicle. In one embodiment, a method includes: receiving, by a processor, landmark data obtained from an image sensor of the vehicle; fusing, by the processor, the landmark data with vehicle pose data to produce fused lane data, wherein the fusing is based on a Kalman filter; retrieving, by the processor, map data from a lane map based on the vehicle pose data; selectively updating, by the processor, the lane map based on a change in the fused lane data from the map data; and controlling, by the processor, the vehicle based on the updated lane map.

<claims>
1. A method for controlling a vehicle, comprising: receiving, by a processor, landmark data obtained from an image sensor of the vehicle; fusing, by the processor, the landmark data with vehicle pose data to produce fused lane data, wherein the fusing is based on a Kalman filter; retrieving, by the processor, map data from a lane map based on the vehicle pose data; selectively updating, by the processor, the lane map based on a change in the fused lane data from the map data; and controlling, by the processor, the vehicle based on the updated lane map.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the fused lane data includes a right lane edge and a left lane edge, and wherein the selectively updating comprises selectively updating a right lane edge and a left lane edge of the lane map based on the right lane edge and the left lane edge of the fused lane data.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the selectively updating comprises: replacing the right lane edge and the left lane edge when the change is greater than a threshold; and fusing the right lane edge and the left lane edge of the lane data with the right lane edge and the left lane edge of the lane map when the change is less than the threshold.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising computing the change based on a hypothesis test.
5. The method of claim 3, further comprising computing the change based on a Mahalanobis distance.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the fused lane data includes a position of a center of the lane, and wherein the method further comprises correcting the vehicle pose data based on the map data and the position of the center of the lane.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the landmark data includes lane markings along the road.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the landmark data includes lane edges inferred from image data.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the landmark data includes structures identified next to a lane edge.
10. A system for controlling a vehicle, comprising: at least one image sensor that generates image data associated with an environment of the vehicle; a map datastore that stores a lane map; and a controller configured to, by a processor, receive landmark data obtained from an image sensor of the vehicle, fuse the landmark data with vehicle pose data to produce fused lane data, wherein the fusing is based on a Kalman filter, retrieve map data from the lane map based on the vehicle pose data, selectively updates the lane map based on a change in the fused lane data from the map data; and controls the vehicle based on the updated lane map.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the fused lane data includes a right lane edge and a left lane edge, and wherein the selectively updating comprises selectively updating a right lane edge and a left lane edge of the lane map based on the right lane edge and the left lane edge of the fused lane data.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the controller selectively updates by replacing the right lane edge and the left lane edge when the change is greater than a threshold; and fusing the right lane edge and the left lane edge of the lane data with the right lane edge and the left lane edge of the lane map when the change is less than the threshold.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the controller computes the change based on a hypothesis test.
14. The system of claim 12, wherein the controller computes the change based on a Mahalanobis distance.
15. The system of claim 10, wherein the fused lane data includes a position of a center of the lane, and wherein the controller corrects the vehicle pose data based on the map data and the position of the center of the lane.
16. The system of claim 10, wherein the landmark data includes lane markings along the road.
17. The system of claim 10, wherein the landmark data includes lane edges inferred from image data.
18. The system of claim 10, wherein the landmark data includes structures identified next to a lane edge.
19. The system of claim 10, wherein the controller continuously updates the map during operation of the vehicle.
20. The system of claim 10, wherein the controller generates map error data for graphically displaying the error on the lane map to a user.
