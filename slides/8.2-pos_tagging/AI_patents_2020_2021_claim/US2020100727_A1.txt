<title>
SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING A SET OF AT LEAST ONE CARDIO-RESPIRATORY DESCRIPTOR OF AN INDIVIDUAL DURING SLEEP
</title>

<abstract>
A system for determining a set of at least one cardio-respiratory descriptor of an individual during sleep comprises a memory device having a first accelerometer for a thoracic position, a second accelerometer synchronized with the first and for an abdominal position, and an optional sensor (e.g., a photoplethysmorgraphic sensor). The system also includes memory for recording accelerometer and optional sensor data; memory with a reference model; and a device for filtering accelerometer data and configured to extract low-, medium-, and high-frequency ranges. A computer is configured for determining, within the extracted frequency ranges, at least one characteristic representative of a cardio-respiratory and physiological state and the time of the extraction thereof; comparing the determined characteristic(s) with similar characteristics from the reference model; and deducing therefrom a set of at least one probable corresponding event the individual experienced during a predetermined period of time.

<claims>
1. A system for determining a set of at least one cardio-respiratory descriptor of an individual during sleep, comprising: a measuring device comprising: a first set of at least one accelerometer, configured so as to be placed in a thoracic position on the individual; a second set of at least one accelerometer, synchronized with the first set of at least one accelerometer and configured so as to be placed in an abdominal position on the individual; and optionally, at least one sensor from amongst a photoplethysmographic sensor (PPG), a microphone, and a set of at least one sensor for measuring angular position synchronized with the first set of at least one accelerometer; a memory for recording data coming from the accelerometers and from the optional sensors; a reference model recorded in another memory, the reference model comprising a correspondence between a set of characteristics distributed over time and a set of given physiological events, each given physiological event preferably being representative of a potential sleep disorder; a device for filtering the data coming from the accelerometers, the device configured for extracting low-frequency, medium-frequency and high-frequency ranges, and a computer configured for: determining, within at least one of the extracted frequency ranges, a set of at least one characteristic representative of a cardio-respiratory and physiological state, together with the time at which the characteristic was extracted; comparing the set of at least one determined characteristic with similar characteristics coming from the reference model, and deducing therefrom a set of at least one probable corresponding event which the individual experienced during a predetermined period of time.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the device for filtering the data is configured for: extracting a low-frequency range, a medium-frequency range and a high-frequency range from the data coming from the first set of at least one accelerometer, and extracting at least one low-frequency range from data coming from the second set of at least one accelerometer.
3. The system claim 1, further comprising: means for determining the position of the individual during sleep, from data coming from at least one from amongst the first set of at least one accelerometer and the second set of at least one accelerometer; and the computer being configured for determining, based on at least one from amongst the set of given physiological events, a set of at least one cardio-respiratory descriptor of the individual.
4. The system of claim 1, further comprising the at least one sensor from amongst: the photoplethysmographic sensor (PPG), the microphone, and the set of at least one sensor for measuring angular position, synchronized with the first set of at least one accelerometer and configured so as to be placed in another thoracic position on the individual; wherein the device for filtering the data is further configured for: coupling data from a set the set of at least one sensor for measuring angular position with data of at least one from amongst the first set of at least one accelerometer and the second set of at least one accelerometer, for extracting characteristics on position of the user or on atypical variations in respiratory angular speed; and/or averaging data coming from the photoplethysmographic sensor (PPG).
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the computer is configured for determining a set of at least one cardio-respiratory descriptor of the individual from amongst: an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), a first set of respiratory forces in data coming from the first set of at least one accelerometer, a second set of respiratory forces in data coming from the second set of at least one accelerometer, a thorax-abdomen desynchronization index, by synchronized comparison of the first set of respiratory forces and of the second set of respiratory forces, a heart rate variability (HRV), an oxymetric profile or oxygen saturation, a respiratory entropy per unit time, a percentage of snoring per unit time; and a night-time profile of the oxygen saturation.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the computer is further configured for selecting a set of characteristics, from amongst the set of at least one determined characteristic, by an algorithm of Sequential Feature Selection (SFS) or Fast Correlation-Based Filter (FCBF) type, prior to comparing the set of at least one determined characteristic with the similar characteristics.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the computer is further configured for calculating at least one from amongst: a temporal correlation between at least two events identified over a same range of time or over several ranges of time; a set of (event/position) pairs; a set of (event/characteristic) pairs; a set of (event/characteristic/position) triplets; and a set of (event/event/characteristic/position) quadruplets.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the computer is further configured for identifying a chain of events which, during a predetermined time window, resulted in a cardio-respiratory descriptor of abnormal value.
9. The system of claim 1, further comprising means of enabling/disabling the accelerometers and the optional at least one sensor.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the memory for recording the data coming from the accelerometers and from the optional sensors and the other memory for recording the reference model are the same, the memory and the other memory being either: remote, or connected via a wired data link with the first set of at least one accelerometer, with the second set of at least one accelerometer, and also with the optional at least one sensor.
