</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the subject disclosure may include, for example, an antenna structure that includes a dielectric antenna and a dielectric core. The dielectric antenna can include an antenna lens that operates as an aperture. The antenna lens can have a structure configured to direct a beam pattern generated by the dielectric antenna from a center axis of the dielectric antenna. The dielectric core can be coupled to a feed point of the dielectric antenna. The dielectric core can supply electromagnetic waves that are converted by the dielectric antenna to the beam pattern directed away from the center axis. Other embodiments are disclosed.
