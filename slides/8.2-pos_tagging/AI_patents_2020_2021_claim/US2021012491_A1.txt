Image Processing Method, Image Processing Device, and Program
</title>

<abstract>
An image processing method includes image inputting, auxiliary information inputting, image processing, feature quantity extracting, and discriminating. The image inputting is inputting a cell image. The auxiliary information inputting is inputting auxiliary information on a color of the cell image. The image processing is generating multiple processed images by performing a different image-processing process on the cell image based on the auxiliary information. The feature quantity extracting is extracting a feature quantity of a discrimination target from each of the multiple processed images. The discriminating is discriminating the discrimination target in the cell image based on the feature quantity.

<claims>
1. An image processing method, comprising: image inputting that is inputting a cell image; auxiliary information inputting that is inputting auxiliary information on a color of the cell image; image processing that is generating multiple processed images by performing a different image-processing process on the cell image based on the auxiliary information; feature quantity extracting that is extracting a feature quantity of a discrimination target from each of the multiple processed images; and discriminating that is discriminating the discrimination target in the cell image based on the feature quantity.
2. The image processing method according to claim 1, wherein the auxiliary information is information on a color of each of a specific region in the cell image, and the image processing is generating the multiple processed images by performing the image-processing process for each of the specific region.
3. The image processing method according to claim 2, wherein the image processing is generating the multiple processed images by performing, as the image-processing process, a normalization process that uses a luminosity average and a luminosity variance of each of the region to which a cell belongs.
4. The image processing method according to claim 1, wherein the auxiliary information is information on a color of each of a type of cell, and the image processing is generating the multiple processed images by performing the image-processing process for each of the type of cell.
5. The image processing method according to claim 4, wherein the image processing is generating the multiple processed images by performing, as the image-processing process, a normalization process that uses a luminosity average and a luminosity variance of each of the type of cell.
6. The image processing method according to claim 1, wherein the auxiliary information is information on a color of the cell image under each of a staining condition, and the image processing is generating the multiple processed images by performing the image-processing process based on the staining condition of the cell image.
7. The image processing method according to claim 6, wherein the image processing is generating the multiple processed images by performing, as the image-processing process, a normalization process that uses a luminosity average and a luminosity variance of each of the staining condition.
8. The image processing method according to claim 1, wherein the feature quantity extracting and the discriminating are performed together.
9. An image processing apparatus, comprising: an image inputter that inputs a cell image; an auxiliary information inputter that inputs auxiliary information on a color of the cell image; and a hardware processor that generates multiple processed images by performing a different image-processing process on the cell image based on the auxiliary information, extracts a feature quantity of a discrimination target from each of the multiple processed images, and discriminates the discrimination target in the cell image based on the feature quantity.
10. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing a program that causes a computer of an image processing apparatus including an image inputter that inputs a cell image and an auxiliary information inputter that inputs auxiliary information on a color of the cell image to perform: generating multiple processed images by performing a different image-processing process on the cell image based on the auxiliary information; extracting a feature quantity of a discrimination target from each of the multiple processed images; and discriminating the discrimination target in the cell image based on the feature quantity.
