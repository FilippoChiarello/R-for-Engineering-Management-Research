Device and method for accelerating graphics processor units, and computer readable storage medium
</title>

<abstract>
A method for accelerating graphics processing units (GPUs) receives a request for usage of GPU resource sent by a user, calculates a quantity of GPUs which are necessary, and arrange the GPUs in several ways to maximize data transmission from and between the GPUs, and between the GPUs and one or more central processing units (CPUs) connected by switches between the GPUs and the CPUs. A device for accelerating GPUs is also provided.
