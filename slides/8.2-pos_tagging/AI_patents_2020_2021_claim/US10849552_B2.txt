<title>
Method and apparatus for enhancing nervous function
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a method for interacting with the nervous system. The method includes detecting signals associated with a biological function at one or more sensors. It also includes processing the signals to create a representation thereof, delivering effector responses based on the representations, and controlling a physical process.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of treating a disease, the method comprising: detecting signals associated with at least one symptom or sign of the disease at one or more sensors; processing the signals to create a symbolic representation of the disease, wherein the symbolic representation indicates a relationship of the signals to the disease empirically and not based on physiologic mapping of the signals to the disease; and stimulating a region of the body to alter the symbolic representation between detected signals and the disease, wherein the stimulating is sufficient to treat the disease and the symbolic representation as altered indicating treatment of the disease.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the disease is a stroke affecting an extremity of the human body.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the signals are detected on the extremity.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises directly transforming the symbolic representation from patterns of nerve firing during the stimulating.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the symbolic representation is not directly transformed from patterns of nerve firing during the stimulating.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the stimulating involves delivering energy to the scalp overlying brain regions associated with the disease.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the stimulating involves delivering energy to regions of the body associated with the disease not including the brain.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one symptom or sign includes a rate of breathing.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the signals are associated with one or more of ventilating (breathing) rate, muscle movement, gastrointestinal function, body temperature, and electrical signals from the nervous system.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the stimulating comprises delivering one or more of electrical stimuli, visual stimuli, and auditory stimuli.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the visual stimuli include displays on a computer device selected from the group consisting a personal computer, a personal digital assistant, a mobile device, a palmtop computer, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a communications device, a control system, a web appliance, and combinations thereof.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein the auditory stimuli include sounds from a computer device selected from the group consisting of a personal computer, a personal digital assistant, a mobile device, a palmtop computer, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a communications device, a control system, a web appliance, and combinations thereof.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the disease is a sleep disorder.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the disease is sleep apnea.
15. A system to treat a disease, the system comprising: a processor, a memory storing instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform operations comprising: detecting signals associated with at least one symptom or sign of the disease at one or more sensors; processing the signals to create a symbolic representation of the disease, wherein the symbolic representation indicates a relationship of the signals to the disease empirically and not based on physiologic mapping of the signals to the disease; and stimulating a region of the body to alter the symbolic representation between detected signals and the disease, wherein the stimulating is sufficient to treat the disease and the symbolic representation as altered indicating treatment of the disease.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the disease is a stroke affecting an extremity of the human body.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein the signals are detected on the extremity.
18. The system of claim 15, wherein the operations further comprise directly transforming the representation from patterns of nerve firing during the stimulating.
19. The system of claim 15, wherein the symbolic representation is not directly transformed from patterns of nerve firing during the stimulating.
20. The system of claim 15, wherein the stimulating involves delivering electrical impulses to the scalp overlying brain regions associated with the disease.
21. The system of claim 15, wherein the stimulating involves delivering energy to regions of the body associated with the disease not including the brain.
22. The system of claim 15, wherein the disease is a sleep disorder.
23. The system of claim 15, wherein the disease is sleep apnea.
