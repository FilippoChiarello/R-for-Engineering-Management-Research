Apparatus and method for reconstructing image using extended neural network
</title>

<abstract>
A method and apparatus for reconstructing an image using an extended neural network is provided. The method includes receiving an input image and reconstructing an output image from the input image using a neural network meeting a predetermined frame constraint. The reconstructing includes transforming the input image into signals corresponding to different frequencies, adjusting coefficients of the transformed signals using a nonlinear function, reconstructing the adjusted coefficients, and inversely transforming all coefficients determined using the reconstructed coefficients into the output image.
