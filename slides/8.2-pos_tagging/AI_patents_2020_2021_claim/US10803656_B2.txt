<title>
Anti-aliasing adaptive shader with pixel tile coverage raster rule system, apparatus and method
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, apparatuses and methods may provide away to render edges of an object defined by multiple tessellation triangles. More particularly, systems, apparatuses and methods may provide a way to perform anti-aliasing at the edges of the object based on a coarse pixel rate, where the coarse pixels may be based on a coarse Z value indicate a resolution or granularity of detail of the coarse pixel. The systems, apparatuses and methods may use a shader dispatch engine to dispatch raster rules to a pixel shader to direct the pixel shader to include, in a tile and/or tessellation triangle, one more finer coarse pixels based on a percent of coverage provided by a finer coarse pixel of a tessellation triangle at or along the edge of the object.

<claims>
1. A graphics pipeline apparatus comprising: a memory comprising geometric primitives, wherein the geometric primitives define at least one object; and a compute shader, implemented at least partly in electronic circuitry, to: detect an edge of the at least one object within a Z value threshold based on tessellation triangles along the edge, wherein the Z value threshold defines a Z value resolution; identify one or more coarse pixels within a threshold distance of the edge as edge coarse pixels, where at least a portion of at least one of the edge coarse pixels crosses two or more of the tessellation triangles; and for each edge coarse pixel that crosses the two or more of the tessellation triangles, determine a percentage of coverage of the edge by the edge coarse pixel; and assign a coarse pixel color at least based on the determined coverage.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the compute shader, for each edge coarse pixel of the edge coarse pixels for each of the two or more of the tessellation triangles crossed, assigns a weighted sample value to each sample in one or more locations of the edge coarse pixel and assigns the coarse pixel color based on one or more of the percentage of coverage of the edge by the edge coarse pixel or the weighted sample values.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the compute shader calculates a surface normal of a first tessellation triangle of the tessellation triangles and a second tessellation triangle of the tessellation triangles, wherein the edge or a sharpness of the edge is defined based on an edge threshold, wherein the edge threshold indicates a difference in the surface normal of the first tessellation triangle and the second tessellation triangle, wherein shading, by a pixel shader, is based on the edge threshold.
4. At least one non-transitory computer readable storage medium comprising a set of instructions, when executed, cause a computing device to: detect an edge of at least one object within a Z value threshold based on tessellation triangles along the edge, wherein the Z value threshold defines a Z value resolution; identify one or more coarse pixels within a threshold distance of the edge as edge coarse pixels, where at least a portion of at least one of the edge coarse pixels crosses two or more of the tessellation triangles; and for each edge coarse pixel that crosses the two or more of the tessellation triangles, determine a percentage of coverage of the edge; and assign a coarse pixel color at least based on the determined coverage.
5. The at least one non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 4, wherein the set of instructions, when executed, cause the computing device to: dispatch, by a shader dispatch engine, one more raster rules to a pixel shader, wherein the shader dispatch engine includes a helper pixel, and wherein the shader dispatch engine and the pixel shader are each implemented at least partly in electronic circuitry; shade, by the pixel shader, the helper pixel to a helper pixel color based on one more of a pixel color weight of finer coarse pixels of an edge coarse pixel or the raster rules; and shade, by the pixel shader, finer coarse pixels of a first tessellation triangle of the tessellation triangles, and using the helper pixel color, shading complement alternative pixels of a second tessellation triangle of the tessellation triangles.
6. The at least one non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 5, wherein the set of instructions, when executed, cause the computing device to: calculate a surface normal of the first tessellation triangle and the second tessellation triangle, wherein the edge or a sharpness of the edge is defined based on an edge threshold, wherein the edge threshold indicates a difference in the surface normal of the first tessellation triangle and the second tessellation triangle, wherein the shading, by the pixel shader, of the helper pixel is based on the edge threshold.
