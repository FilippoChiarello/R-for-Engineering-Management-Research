<title>
ANOMALOUS BEHAVIOR DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
A training dataset is used to train an unsupervised machine learning trained model. Corresponding gradient values are determined for a plurality of entries included in the training dataset using the trained unsupervised machine learning model. A first subset of the training dataset is selected based on the determined corresponding gradient values and a first threshold value selected from a set of threshold values. A labeled version of the selected first subset is used to train a first supervised machine learning model to detect one or more anomalies.

A method, comprising: using a training dataset to train an unsupervised machine learning trained model; determining corresponding gradient values for a plurality of entries included in the training dataset using the trained unsupervised machine learning model; selecting a first subset of the training dataset based on the determined corresponding gradient values and a first threshold value selected from a set of threshold values; and using a labeled version of the selected first subset to train a first supervised machine learning model to detect one or more anomalies.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: selecting a second subset of the training dataset based on the determined corresponding gradient values and a second threshold value selected from the set threshold values; using a labeled version of the selected second subset to train a second supervised machine learning trained anomaly detection model; and selecting among a group of supervised machine learning trained models including at least the first trained supervised machine learning model and the second trained supervised machine learning model, a model based on one or more performance metrics of each of the supervised machine learning trained models in the group.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the unsupervised machine learning trained model is a clustering algorithm.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the trained unsupervised machine learning model is configured to generate a gradient range for entries included in the training dataset.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising removing one or more entries of the training dataset that are equal to the first threshold value.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the first subset of the training dataset include one or more entries that were not removed from the training dataset.
7. The method of claim 4, wherein an entry of the training dataset is labeled as being normal in the event a corresponding gradient value of the entry is less than the first threshold value and the entry of the training dataset is labeled as being anomalous in the event the corresponding gradient value is greater than the first threshold value.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising applying a validation dataset to the first trained supervised machine learning model.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the first trained supervised machine learning model is associated with one or more corresponding performance metrics based on the validation dataset being applied to the first trained supervised machine learning model.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the one or more corresponding performance metrics include at least one of a number of false positives, a number of false negatives, a number of true positives, or a number of true negatives.
11. The method of claim 2, wherein the first threshold value and the second threshold value correspond to a gradient value included in a gradient range.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein the second threshold value is greater than the first threshold value.
