Event premises media control for training and performance
</title>

<abstract>
A system can include a server connected to a public media system in a public event premises. The system can provide a relatively large number of mobile devices access to and control of one or more public media systems. A permissioned user of the system can monitor performance by and enforce behaviors of other users through management of public media systems at remote public event premises.
