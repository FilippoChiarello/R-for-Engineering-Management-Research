<title>
Using a mobile phone for monitoring a medical device
</title>

<abstract>
A server having stored thereon information associated with an identified portable medical device. The server is configured to receive a position and a time point of a client device, and configured to use the position and the time point to retrieve position-specific data for the time point. The position-specific data is used to determine whether the portable medical device should be serviced or replaced.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A server having stored thereon information associated with an identified portable medical device, the server being configured to receive a position and a time point of a client device, and configured to use the position and the time point to retrieve position-specific data for the time point, and to use the position-specific data to determine whether the portable medical device should be serviced or replaced; and wherein the server being further configured to receive at least a first time point associated with a first position for the client device and a second time point associated with a second position for the client device; and receiving, from the portable medical device a time point for when the medical device has been in use (third time point), the server having time point selection software that selects, among at least the first time point and the second time point, the time point that is closest to the third time point, the server being configured to use the selected time point and position to retrieve the position-specific data.
2. The server according to claim 1, where the determination if the medical device should be serviced or replaced involves the server applying a decision rule, said decision rule being generated by applying machine learning to a data set, said data set comprising previously collected position-specific data for comparable medical devices, said data set also comprising data about previous failures of the comparable portable medical devices.
3. A mobile phone having stored thereon information about an individual portable medical device of a user, the mobile phone carried by the user and being configured to: independent of operation of the portable medical device, determine and store the geographical position of the mobile phone as a proxy for a position of the portable medical device together with a time point for the determination of the geographical position; independent of operation of the portable medical device, provide said geographical position and said time point to a server via a data connection; and receive information from the server indicating that the portable medical device should be serviced or replaced.
4. The mobile phone according to claim 3, wherein the mobile phone is further configured to determine and store the geographical position of the mobile phone together with the time point for the determination of the geographical position at a plurality of predetermined time periods.
5. The mobile phone according to claim 4, wherein the mobile phone is further configured to transmit the stored geographical positions and associated time points to the server at predetermined time intervals.
6. The mobile phone according to claim 3, wherein the data connection over which the geographical position and the time point are provided from the mobile phone to the server is made over a first communication pathway to a communications medium between the mobile phone and the communications medium that is different than a second communication pathway between the portable medical device and the communications medium over which data from the portable medical device is communicated to the server.
