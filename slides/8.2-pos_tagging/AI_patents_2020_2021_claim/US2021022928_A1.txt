DIAPER STATE SENSOR AND NOTIFICATION NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
A diaper state change notification device has a power source, a micro controller capable of generating a notification, a wireless communications chip, and one or more sensors incorporated in the device or coupled thereto, characterized in that the notification device is attached to or otherwise embedded within a diaper and generates and sends a notification to a monitoring entity upon sensor detection of a diaper state change from a fresh diaper state to a soiled diaper state.

<claims>
1. A diaper state change notification device comprising: a power source; a micro controller capable of generating a notification; a wireless communications chip; one or more sensors incorporated in the device or coupled thereto; characterized in that the notification device is attached to or otherwise embedded within a diaper and generates and sends a notification to a monitoring entity upon sensor detection of a diaper state change from a fresh diaper state to a soiled diaper state.
2. The diaper state change notification device of claim 1, wherein the power source is a micro battery.
3. The diaper state change notification device of claim 1, wherein the one or more sensors are embedded in the diaper core material and are coupled to the device via one or more conductive traces, the device affixed to the outside of the diaper.
4. The diaper state change notification device of claim 3, wherein the device is reusable and may be detached from a used diaper and reattached to a new diaper.
5. The diaper state change notification device of FIG. 1, wherein the one or more sensors are mounted on the device, the device embedded within the diaper core material, and wherein the device is not reusable beyond sending one notification of a diaper state change.
6. The diaper state change notification device of claim 5, wherein the power source is a power generating circuit that harnesses ambient radio waves and redirects the energy to generating and sending a notification upon sensor detection of a change in diaper state.
7. The diaper state change notification device of claim 3 attached to the waist band of the diaper and coupled manually to one or more conductive sensor traces.
8. The diaper state change notification device of claim 1, wherein the one or more sensors detect change in moisture, humidity, and or the presence of or increased level of one or more chemicals associated with human urine and or human excrement.
9. The diaper state change notification device of claim 1, wherein the device communicates a notification to another device operated or maintained in operation by a monitoring entity as a Blue Tooth™ enabled device.
10. The diaper state change and notification device of claim 1, wherein the device may be remotely activated and remotely deactivated.
11. The diaper state change notification device of claim 10, wherein remote activation or deactivation may be performed using a Blue Tooth™ enabled communications device running an application adapted to recognize the device and to receive notification from the device.
12. A network-based tracking apparatus for counting soiled diapers comprising: a diaper state change notification device having a power source, a micro controller capable of generating a notification, a wireless communications chip, and one or more sensors incorporated into the device or coupled thereto, the device or at least the associated sensor or sensors embedded within the diaper; a monitoring computing device having wireless communications access to the diaper state change notification device and at least wireless communications access to the Internet through a network modem or gateway, the monitoring device hosting an application adapted to receive and process a notification from the diaper state change notification device, and at least one server connected to the network, the server accessible over the network to the monitoring device, the server coupled to at least one data repository adapted for storing an updated count of used diapers over time; characterized in that the diaper state change notification device generates and sends a diaper state change notification to the monitoring computing device upon sensor detection of a diaper state change from a fresh diaper state to a soiled diaper state, and wherein the monitoring computing device date and time stamps the received notification and accesses, if not connected, the at least one server on the Internet and sends one or more than one date and time stamped notification events received over time to the server, the server recording the data in the data repository.
13. The network-based tracking apparatus of claim 12, wherein the power source of the diaper state change notification device is a power generating circuit that harnesses ambient radio waves and redirects the energy to generating and sending a notification upon sensor detection of a change in diaper state.
14. The network-based tracking apparatus of claim 12, wherein the diaper state change notification device is disposable and in operation only sends one notification.
15. The network-based tracking apparatus of claim 12, wherein the updated count of soiled diapers in the repository is redistributed periodically to at least one other server on the network the at least one other server charged with managing a subscription to a diaper order and fulfillment service for at least one subscriber.
16. The network-based tracking apparatus of claim 12, wherein the monitoring computing device is a mobile phone running a browser-based application adapted to at least manage tracking of the number of soiled diapers over time.
17. The network-based tracking apparatus of claim 12, wherein the monitoring computing device is operated by a parent or relative of one or more children wearing the diapers.
18. The network-based tracking apparatus of claim 12, wherein the monitoring computing device is operated by a caretaker entrusted by parents to manage a group of children wearing the diapers.
19. The network-based tracking apparatus of claim 18, wherein the monitoring computing device operated by the caretaker hosts an application adapted to receive diaper state change notifications across subscriptions.
20. The network-based tracking apparatus of claim 19, wherein unique identifiers assigned to individual diaper state notification devices are traceable to the individual diaper subscription accounts.
