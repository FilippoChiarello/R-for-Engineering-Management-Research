METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR VOICE AND ACUPRESSURE -BASED LIFESTYLE MANAGEMENT WITH SMART DEVICES
</title>

<abstract>
In one aspect, a computerized method for implementing voice and acupressure-based lifestyle management includes the step of measuring a speed at which a user is speaking. A wearable device records the user's voice with a microphone and communicates a digital recording of the user's voice to a computer processor. The method includes the step of measuring a time spacing between a set of user's words and a length of the set of user's words. The method includes the step of determining at least one anomaly by comparing the digital recording of the user's voice with a benchmark recording of the user's voice. The method includes the step of alerting the user of the detected anomaly.

<claims>
What is claimed as new and desired to be protected by Letters Patent of the United States is:
1. A computerized method for implementing voice and acupressure-based lifestyle management comprising: measuring a speed at which a user is speaking, wherein a wearable device records the user's voice with a microphone and communicates a digital recording of the user's voice to a computer processor; measuring a time spacing between a set of user's words and a length of the set of user's words; determining at least one anomaly by comparing the digital recording of the user's voice with a benchmark recording of the user's voice; and alerting the user of the detected anomaly.
2. The computerized method of claim 1 further comprising: providing a real-time feedback that help make the user more aware ability to adapt and adjust to be a better speaker.
3. The computerized method of claim 2 further comprising: measuring breathing pattern of the user with the microphone of the mobile device.
4. The computerized method of claim 3, wherein the breath rate is measured with the user's speech.
5. The computerized method of claim 4, wherein the mobile device comprises a smart watch with a pulse sensor.
6. The computerized method of claim 5, wherein the pulse rate, the breath rate and the user's speech pattern are used to determine a user emotional state.
7. The computerized method of claim 6 further comprising: based on the user's emotional state, providing feedback to the user when it is determined that the user is in a negative or highly emotional state.
8. The computerized method of claim 7, wherein the user wears an acupressure band.
9. The computerized method of claim 8, wherein the acupressure band comprises a computer networking system and one or more mechanical acupressure applicators.
10. The computerized method of claim 9, wherein the mobile device signals the acupressure band to apply pressure to a specified acupressure point based on a detected user emotional state.
11. The computerized method of claim 10, wherein the acupressure point comprises a PC6 acupressure point or an H7 acupressure point.
12. The computerized method of claim 9, wherein the mobile device signals the acupressure band to apply pressure to a specified acupressure point based on a specified pulse rate of the user.
13. The computerized method of claim 1, wherein the alert comprises an alarm sound and a haptic pattern.
14. A computerized system useful for implementing voice and acupressure-based lifestyle management comprising: at least one processor configured to execute instructions; at least one memory containing instructions when executed on the at least one processor, causes the at least one processor to perform operations that: measure a speed at which a user is speaking, wherein a wearable device records the user's voice with a microphone and communicates a digital recording of the user's voice to a computer processor; measure a time spacing between a set of user's words and a length of the set of user's words; determine at least one anomaly by comparing the digital recording of the user's voice with a benchmark recording of the user's voice; and alert the user of the detected anomaly.
15. The computerized system of claim 14 The computerized method of claim 7, wherein the user wears an acupressure band.
16. The computerized system of claim 15, wherein the acupressure band comprises a computer networking system and one or more mechanical acupressure applicators.
17. The computerized system of claim 16, wherein the mobile device signals the acupressure band to apply pressure to a specified acupressure point based on a detected user emotional state.
18. The computerized system of claim 17, wherein the acupressure point comprises a PC6 acupressure point or an H7 acupressure point.
19. The computerized system of claim 18, wherein the mobile device signals the acupressure band to apply pressure to a specified acupressure point based on a specified pulse rate of the user.
20. The computerized system of claim 19, wherein the user's voice volume, pitch, resonance, signature, melody are measured.
