WIRE ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE MACHINING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
The invention is related to a method for the monitoring of a wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) process, the method comprising the steps of: setting a unit observation length for the signal acquisition, continuously acquiring at least one process signal which is representative of an amount of material removed by at least one discharge and the position (X;Y) of said at least one discharge, and determining, based on said at least one process signal and one or more properties of a current machining, a cumulated amount of material removed per unit observation length along a machining path, including amounts of material removed by travelling in a forward cutting direction and amounts of material removed by travelling in a reverse cutting direction.
