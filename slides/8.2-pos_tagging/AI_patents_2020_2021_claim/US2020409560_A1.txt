INFORMATION COLLECTION DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
An object is to provide a technique capable of appropriately storing data. An information collection device includes a similarity degree determination unit configured to obtain a degree of similarity between acquired-data and saved-data and generate a link that associates the acquired-data and the saved-data based on the degree of similarity, a request estimation unit configured to generate a link that associates the saved-data when the saved-data is read, and estimate a future request for the saved-data, and a data life determination unit configured to determine a storage time limit of the saved-data on a link-by-link basis.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An information collection device comprising: acquisition circuitry configured to acquire data including an image of at least one of inside and outside of a vehicle as acquired-data; similarity degree determination circuitry configured to obtain a degree of similarity between the acquired-data and the saved-data based on characteristics of the acquired-data and characteristics of the saved-data, the saved-data being the acquired-data stored in a database and generate a link that associates the acquired-data and the saved-data based on the degree of similarity; request estimation circuitry configured to generate a link that associates the saved-data when the saved-data is read, and estimate a future request for the saved-data; time limit determination circuitry configured to determine a storage time limit of the saved-data in the database on a link-by link basis based on a generation result in the similarity degree determination circuitry and an estimation result in the request estimation circuitry; and database processing circuitry configured to manage the saved-data in the database based on the storage time limit determined by the time limit determination circuitry.
2. The information collection device according to claim 1, wherein the data further includes sensor information collected by a sensor of the vehicle and navigation information collected by a navigation device of the vehicle.
3. The information collection device according to claim 1, further comprising: a time limit table configured to store the storage time limit determined in the time limit determination circuitry on a link-by-link basis, wherein the database processing circuitry is configured to reduce or delete the saved-data in the database based on the storage time limit stored in the time limit table.
4. The information collection device according to claim 1, wherein the request estimation circuitry is configured to estimate the request based on an attribute of an application that uses the saved-data in the vehicle.
5. The information collection device according to claim 1, further comprising communication circuitry configured to communicate at least one of the acquired-data and the saved-data with the outside of the vehicle.
6. The information collection device according to claim 1, wherein the request estimation circuitry is configured to estimate the request based on an attribute of an application that uses the saved-data outside the vehicle.
7. The information collection device according to claim 1, wherein the database includes a first database provided in the vehicle and a second database provided outside the vehicle.
