METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR SUGGESTING REVISIONS TO AN ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a method for suggesting revisions to a document-under-analysis ("DUA") from a seed database, the seed database including a plurality of original texts each respectively associated with one of a plurality of final texts. The method includes tokenizing the DUA into a plurality of statements-under-analysis ("SUAs"), selecting a first SUA of the plurality of SUAs, generating a first similarity score for each of the plurality of the original texts, the similarity score representing a degree of similarity between the first SUA and each of the original texts, selecting a first candidate original text of the plurality of the original texts, and creating an edited. SUA ("ESUA") by modifying a copy of the first SUA consistent with a first candidate final text associated with the first candidate original text.

<claims>
1. 1-27. (canceled)
28. A computer-implemented method for suggesting revisions to text data, the method comprising: obtaining an electronic document under analysis (DUA); tokenizing the DUA into one or more statements under analysis (SUAs); selecting a first SUA of the one or more SUAs; selecting a candidate original text from a seed database; determining, using a natural language processing (NLP) alignment of the first SUA and the candidate original text, an edit operation to apply to the DUA; and recording the determined edit operation in an appendix.
29. The method of claim 28, further comprising: creating the appendix to the DUA.
30. The method of claim 28, wherein the appendix is a separate electronic file from the DUA.
31. The method of claim 28, wherein the appendix further comprises a reference to the DUA.
32. The method of claim 28, wherein the DUA is a portable document format electronic document.
33. The method of claim 28, wherein the determining, using the NLP alignment of the first SUA and the candidate original text, the edit operation to apply to the DUA further comprises: aligning the first SUA with the candidate original text according to a first alignment; obtaining a candidate final text associated with the candidate original text; and, determining a first set of one or more edit operations that convert the first SUA to the candidate final text, wherein the first set of one or more edit operations comprises the first determined edit operation.
34. The method of claim 33, further comprising: creating a first edited SUA (first "ESUA") by applying to the first SUA one or more edit operations from the first set of one or more edit operations according to the first alignment.
35. The method of claim 28, further comprising: obtaining a sample database comprising a plurality of sample original texts and a plurality of sample final texts, wherein each sample original text is associated with a respective sample final text; obtaining an input comprising an indication of a user preference; selecting one or more of the plurality of sample originals texts and the plurality of sample final texts based on the user preference; and loading, into the seed database, the selected one or more of the plurality of sample original texts and the plurality of sample final texts.
36. The method of claim 28 further comprising: displaying in a user interface the determined edit operation; and prompting a user to accept the determined edit operation.
37. A non-transitory computer readable medium storing instructions configured to cause a computer to perform the method of claim 28.
38. A system for suggesting revisions to text data, the system comprising: a processor; a non-transitory computer readable memory coupled to the processor, wherein the processor is configured to: obtain an electronic document under analysis (DUA); tokenize the DUA into one or more statements under analysis (SUAs); select a first SUA of the one or more SUAs; select a candidate original text from a seed database; determine, using a natural language processing (NLP) alignment of the first SUA and the candidate original text, an edit operation to apply to the DUA; and record the determined edit operation in an appendix
39. The system of claim 38, wherein the processor is further configured to: create the appendix to the DUA.
40. The system of claim 38, wherein the appendix is a separate electronic file from the DUA.
41. The system of claim 38, wherein the appendix further comprises a reference to the DUA.
42. The system of claim 38, wherein the DUA is a portable document format electronic document.
43. The system of claim 38, wherein the processor is further configured to: align the first SUA with the candidate original text according to a first alignment; obtain a candidate final text associated with the candidate original text; and, determine a first set of one or more edit operations that convert the first SUA to the candidate final text, wherein the first set of one or more edit operations comprises the first determined edit operation.
44. The system of claim 43, wherein the processor is further configured to: create a first edited SUA (first "ESUA") by applying to the first SUA one or more edit operations from the first set of one or more edit operations according to the first alignment.
45. The system of claim 38, wherein the processor is further configured to: obtain a sample database comprising a plurality of sample original texts and a plurality of sample final texts, wherein each sample original text is associated with a respective sample final text; obtain an input comprising an indication of a user preference; select one or more of the plurality of sample originals texts and the plurality of sample final texts based on the user preference; and load, into the seed database, the selected one or more of the plurality of sample original texts and the plurality of sample final texts.
46. The system of claim 38, wherein the processor is further configured to: display in a user interface the determined edit operation; and prompt a user to accept the determined edit operation.
