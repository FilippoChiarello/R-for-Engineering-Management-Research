SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DEPICTION AND COUNTING OF EXTERNAL STRUCTURES ON A FISH
</title>

<abstract>
A system (1) for in-situ monitoring and recording of fish health of fish in a fish cage (9), the system (1) comprising at least one camera housing (3). The camera housing (3) is provided with a camera group (2) comprising at least two cameras (21) arranged to take synchronized pictures for digital close- range photogrammetry; the system (1) comprises a central data-processing unit (7), the central data-processing unit (7) being arranged to calculate a three-dimensional model (6, 60, 69) of an object (5) photographed synchronously by the at least two cameras (21); and the data- processing unit (7) is arranged to report the number of structures (53; 61-63) deviating from the smooth surface of the object (5) in the three-dimensional model (6, 60).

C l a i m s
1. A system (1) for in-situ monitoring and recording of fish health of fish in a fish cage (9), the system (1) comprising at least one camera housing (3), characterized i n that the camera housing (3) is provided with a camera group (2) comprising at least two cameras (21) arranged to take synchronized pictures for digital close-range photogrammetry; the sys tem (1) comprises a central data-processing unit (7), the central dataprocessing unit (7) being arranged to calculate a three-dimensional model (6, 60, 69) of an object (5) photographed synchronously by the at least two cameras (21); and the data-processing unit (7) is arranged to report the number of structures (53; 61-63) deviating from the smooth surface of the object (5) in the three-dimensional model (6, 60).
2. The system (1) in accordance with claim 1, wherein the camera group (2) comprises a video surveillance camera (23).
3. The system (1) in accordance with any one of the preceding claims, wherein the camera housing (3) comprises two camera groups (2).
4. The system (1) in accordance with any one of the preceding claims, wherein the camera housing (3) is attached to an underwater vehicle (8).
5. The system (1) in accordance with claim 4, wherein the underwater vehicle (8) is an autonomous underwater vehicle (8).
6. The system (1) in accordance with any one of the preceding claims, wherein the system (1) comprises at least two camera housings (3) attached to an underwater vehicle (8).
7. The system (1) in accordance with any one of the preceding claims, wherein the system (1) comprises communication means for wireless transmission of acquired data from the at least two cameras (21) to the central dataprocessing unit (7).
8. A fish cage (9) provided with a system (1) in accordance with any one of the preceding claims, wherein the fish cage (9) is provided with a charging sta tion (81) for an underwater vehicle (8).
9. The fish cage (9) provided with a system (1) in accordance with any one of the preceding claims, wherein the fish cage (9) is provided with two underwater vehicles (8), and each underwater vehicle (8) is provided with at least one camera housing (3).
10. A method for in-situ monitoring and recording of fish health of fish in a fish cage (9), characterized i n that the method comprises the steps of:
- providing a system (1) in accordance with any one of the preceding claims;
- synchronously photographing an object (5) in the fish cage (9) with the cameras (21) of the camera group (2);
- processing the data acquired from the system (1) in the central dataprocessing unit (7);
- calculating a three-dimensional model (6, 60, 69) of the photographed ob ject (5);
- analysing the three-dimensional model (6, 60) for structures (53; 61-63) deviating from the smooth surface of the object (5) and counting the num ber of such structures (53; 61-63); and
- reporting the number of such structures (53; 61-63).
11. The method in accordance with claim 10, wherein the method further com prises calculating and reporting the size of the structures (53; 61-63).
