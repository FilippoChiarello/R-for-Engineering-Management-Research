System and method for managing digital ink typesetting
</title>

<abstract>
A system, method and computer program product for managing typesetting of digital ink structured content on computing devices. Each computing device has a processor and at least one system application for recognizing handwriting input under control of the processor. The system application determines dimensional information of at least digital ink text elements of structured content, calculates a first font size for each typeset ink text element respectively corresponding to the digital ink text elements based on at least part of the dimensional information, categorizes the typeset ink text elements into one or more categories of the structured content, determines a second font size for each typeset ink text element based on the first font size of each typeset ink text element of the respective category, and display, on a display associated with the computing device, the typeset ink text elements at the respective determined second font sizes.

5. A system as claimed in claim 4, wherein the dimensional information includes geometrical information of the typeset ink non-text elements.
6. A system as claimed in claim 5, wherein: at least part of at least one of the one or more of the digital ink text elements is contained within the related digital ink non-text element; and the first font size of the corresponding typeset ink text element is calculated so that the typeset ink text element is fully contained by the corresponding typeset ink non-text element.
7. A method for managing typesetting of digital ink structured content on a computing device, the computing device comprising a processor and at least one non-transitory computer readable medium for recognizing handwriting input under control of the processor, the method comprising: detecting one or more inputs forming at least a plurality of digital ink text elements of structured content; determining dimensional information of at least the plurality of digital ink text elements of structured content; wherein the dimensional information comprises geometrical information and typographical information of at least the plurality of digital ink text elements of structured content; calculating a first font size for each of a plurality of typeset ink text elements respectively corresponding to the digital ink text elements based on the dimensional information; categorizing the typeset ink text elements into one or more categories of the structured content; determining a second font size for each of the typeset ink text elements based on the first font size of each typeset ink text element of the respective category; detecting a second input as a digital ink non-text element; determining whether the second input is associated with at least the plurality of digital ink text elements of the structured content; assigning, based on a determination that the second input is associated with at least the plurality of digital ink text elements of the structured content, a typeset ink non-text element corresponding to the second input detected as the digital ink non-text element to the category associated with the second font size; and displaying, on a display associated with the respective computing device, the plurality of typeset ink text elements, surrounded by the typeset ink non-text element assigned to the category associated with the second font size, at the respective determined second font sizes.
8. A method as claimed in claim 7, wherein the typeset ink text elements are categorized based on the dimensional information of the corresponding digital ink text elements.
