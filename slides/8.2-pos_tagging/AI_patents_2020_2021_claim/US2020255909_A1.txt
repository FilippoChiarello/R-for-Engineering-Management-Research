INTEGRATED MACHINE-LEARNING FRAMEWORK TO ESTIMATE HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION DEFICIENCY
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and software are provided for determining a homologous recombination pathway status of a cancer in a test subject, e.g., to improve cancer treatment predictions and outcomes. In some embodiments, classifiers using one or more of (i) a heterozygosity status for DNA damage repair genes in a cancerous tissue, (ii) a measure of the loss of heterozygosity across the genome of the cancerous tissue, (iii) a measure of variant alleles detected in a second plurality of DNA damage repair genes in the genome of the cancerous tissue, (iv) a measure of variant alleles detected in the second plurality of DNA damage repair genes in the genome of a non-cancerous tissue, and (v) tumor sample purity are provided.
