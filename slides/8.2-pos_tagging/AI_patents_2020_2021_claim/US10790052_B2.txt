<title>
Medication assurance system and method
</title>

<abstract>
A medication assurance system for verification of both the medication and the patient is disclosed. A portable spectrometer is used to obtain a light spectrum of the medication. A subject identification or biometric device is used to identify the patient. A controller coupled to the portable spectrometer and the subject identification device identifies the medication by performing a chemometric analysis of the light spectrum. Based on the medication identified and the patient identified, the controller can determine if the medication is to be taken by the patient.

<claims>
1. A spectrometer comprising: a light collecting element to collect light after the light is transmitted through a medication for a first time, reflected from a coating of a medication holder, and transmitted through the medication for a second time, the light including light reflected by a lower side of the medication; and one or more components to: identify data based on the light, the medication being identified based on an analysis of the data.
2. The spectrometer of claim 1, further comprising: a first light source for providing a first portion of the light; and a second light source for providing a second portion of the light.
3. The spectrometer of claim 2, where the first light source and the second light source are disposed symmetrically on both sides of the light collecting element.
4. The spectrometer of claim 2, where the first light source and the second light source are incandescent light bulbs.
5. The spectrometer of claim 1, where the one or more components include a photodetector array.
6. The spectrometer of claim 1, further comprising: a laterally variable filter to receive the light from the light collecting element.
7. The spectrometer of claim 1, further comprising: a light source; and a microcontroller to control an operation of the light source.
8. The spectrometer of claim 1, further comprising: a microcontroller to process the data.
9. The spectrometer of claim 1, where the data is a transflection spectrum of the medication.
10. The spectrometer of claim 9, where the transflection spectrum is a combination of a diffuse reflection of the medication and a transmission spectrum of the medication.
11. A spectrometer comprising: a light collecting element to collect light after the light is transmitted through a medication at a first time and transmitted through the medication at a second time after being transmitted through the medication for the first time, where the light is reflected from a reflective coating of a medication holder, that holds the medication, after the light is transmitted through the medication for the first time.
12. The spectrometer of claim 11, where the light includes light reflected by a lower side of the medication.
13. The spectrometer of claim 11, further comprising: one more or components to identify data based on the light, where the medication is identified based on an analysis of the data, and where the data is a transflection spectrum of the medication.
14. The spectrometer of claim 11, where the spectrometer is a portable spectrometer.
15. The spectrometer of claim 11, where the light collecting element is a tapered light pipe.
16. The spectrometer of claim 11, where the light collecting element comprises: a first end for receiving the light, and a second end for mixing and spreading the light.
17. The spectrometer of claim 16, where the first end is narrower than the second end.
18. The spectrometer of claim 11, further comprising: a laterally variable filter to receive the light from the light collecting element, the light collecting element including an end that faces the laterally variable filter; and a lens element on the end.
19. A spectrometer comprising: a light collecting element to collect light after the light is transmitted through a medication at a first time and transmitted through the medication at a second time after being transmitted through the medication for the first time; a medication holder to hold the medication; and a laterally variable filter to receive the light from the light collecting element.
20. The spectrometer of claim 19, where the light is reflected from the medication holder after the light is transmitted through the medication for the first time.
