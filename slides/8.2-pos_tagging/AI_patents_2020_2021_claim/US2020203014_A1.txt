METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR SEQUENCING-BASED VARIANT DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
Provided herein are methods and systems for detecting genetic variants from sequencing data. The methods and systems provided herein can be useful for identifying the presence or absence of clinically actionable variants from a sequencing data set and reporting the clinically actionable variants to a user of the methods and systems.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for detecting the presence or absence of a genetic variant, comprising: (a) receiving a data input comprising sequencing data generated from a nucleic acid sample from a subject; (b) determining a presence or absence of said genetic variant from said sequencing data, wherein said determining comprises assigning a quality score to a genomic region comprising said genetic variant, wherein said assigning is performed by a computer processor; (c) classifying said genetic variant based on said quality score to generate a classified genetic variant, and (d) outputting a result based on said classifying, thereby identifying said classified genetic variant, wherein said classifying further comprises classifying said genetic variant as present if said genetic variant is determined to be present and said quality score for said genomic region comprising said genetic variant is greater than a predetermined threshold, wherein said classifying further comprises classifying said genetic variant as absent if said genetic variant is determined to be absent and said quality score for said genomic region comprising said genetic variant is greater than a predetermined threshold, and wherein said classifying further comprises classifying said genetic variant as indeterminate if said quality score for said genomic region comprising said genetic variant is less than a predetermined threshold.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein said outputting a result comprises generating a report, wherein said report identifies said classified genetic variant.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising mapping said sequencing data to a reference sequence.
4. (canceled)
5. (canceled)
6. The method of claim 1, wherein said predetermined threshold comprises a depth of coverage of said genomic region comprising said genetic variant.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein said depth of coverage is at least 10Ã—.
8. 8.-11. (canceled)
12. The method of claim 1, wherein said predetermined threshold comprises a confidence score.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein said confidence score is at least 95%.
14. (canceled)
15. The method of claim 1, wherein said genetic variant comprises a clinically actionable variant.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein said identifying said classified genetic variant further indicates a treatment for said subject based on said classified genetic variant.
17. (canceled)
18. (canceled)
19. The method of claim 16, wherein said subject is administered a treatment based on said result.
20. The method of claim 15, wherein said clinically actionable variant is in a gene that alters a response of said subject to a therapy.
21. (canceled)
22. The method of claim 15, wherein a presence of a clinically actionable variant indicates said subject is a candidate for a specific therapy.
23. The method of claim 15, wherein an absence of a clinically actionable variant indicates said subject is not a candidate for a specific therapy.
24. 24.-31. (canceled)
32. The method of claim 1, wherein said genetic variant is a gene amplification, an insertion, a deletion, a translocation or a single nucleotide polymorphism.
33. The method of claim 1, wherein said sequencing data comprises target-enriched sequencing data.
34. The method of claim 33, wherein said target-enriched sequencing data comprises whole exome sequencing data.
35. The method of claim 1, wherein said sequencing data comprises whole genome sequencing data.
36. The method of claim 1, wherein said classifying has a sensitivity of at least 99%.
37. The method of claim 1, wherein said classifying has a specificity of at least 99%.
38. The method of claim 1, wherein said genetic variant, when classified as present, has a mutant allele fraction of at least 5%.
39. (canceled)
40. The method of claim 1, wherein said classifying has a positive predictive value of at least 99%.
41. The method of claim 1, wherein said quality score is based on at least one of a depth of coverage, a mapping quality, or a base call quality.
42. 42.-44. (canceled)
45. The method of claim 1, further comprising, prior to step (a), sequencing said nucleic acid sample from said subject to generate said sequencing data.
46. The method of claim 1, further comprising requerying said sequencing data to determine a presence or an absence of one or more additional genetic variants, comprising assigning a quality score to each of one or more genomic regions comprising said one or more additional genetic variants, wherein said quality score is classified as sufficient if said quality score is greater than a predetermined threshold and wherein said quality score is classified as insufficient if said quality score is lower than a predetermined threshold.
47. The method of claim 1, wherein said quality score is determined by a total read depth at a specific location of said genetic variant, a proportion of reads containing said genetic variant, the mean quality of non-variant base calls at said location of said genetic variant, and the difference in mean quality for variant base calls.
48. The method of claim 47, wherein said quality score is determined by a machine learning algorithm.
49. 49.-131. (canceled)
