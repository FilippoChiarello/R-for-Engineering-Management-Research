<title>
Systems, devices, software, and methods for diagnosis of cardiac ischemia and coronary artery disease
</title>

<abstract>
Described herein are methods, software, systems and devices for detecting the presence of an abnormality in an organ, tissue, body, or portion thereof of a subject by analysis of the electromagnetic fields generated by the organ, tissue, body, or portion thereof.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A diagnostic system configured to determine whether cardiac ischemia is present in an individual, the diagnostic system comprising: (1) an electromagnetic field sensor configured to be positioned outside of a body of the individual and not in contact with the body of the individual in order to non-invasively sense an electromagnetic field measurement generated by a heart of the individual; (2) a processor operably coupled to the electromagnetic field sensor; and (3) a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium encoded with software comprising a trained machine learning software module that is trained using training data comprising electromagnetic field data, wherein the software is executable by the processor and causes the processor to: (a) receive the electromagnetic field measurement from the electromagnetic field sensor; and (b) determine whether the cardiac ischemia is present in the heart of the individual based on the electromagnetic field measurement by analyzing the electromagnetic field measurement using the trained machine learning software module and without generating a map of the electromagnetic field measurement.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the software is further configured to cause the processor to determine whether a coronary artery occlusion is present in the individual based on the electromagnetic field measurement.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the coronary artery occlusion is determined to be present when the electromagnetic field measurement comprises an irregular pattern of magnetic pole dispersion.
4. The system of claim 2, wherein the coronary artery occlusion is determined to be present with a degree of occlusion of greater than 50%.
5. The system of claim 2, wherein the coronary artery occlusion is determined to be present with a degree of occlusion of greater than 70%.
6. The system of claim 2, wherein the coronary artery occlusion is determined to be present with a degree of occlusion of greater than 90%.
7. The system of claim 2, wherein the system is further configured to determine whether the cardiac ischemia is present in the heart of the individual, when the individual has at least one negative troponin value.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein system is further configured to determine whether the cardiac ischemia is present in the heart of the individual, when the individual has a normal electrocardiogram.
9. The system of claim 1, further comprising a sensor array, wherein the electromagnetic field sensor is positioned within the sensor array.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the electromagnetic field sensor comprises an optically pumped magnetometer or a superconducting quantum interference device sensor.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the training data used to train comprises heart-related data.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to generate a waveform from the electromagnetic field measurement.
13. The system of claim 1, wherein the software is further configured to cause the processor to determine a therapy for treating the individual based on whether the cardiac ischemia is determined to be present.
14. The system of claim 1, wherein the trained machine learning software module comprises a deep neural network.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the deep neural network comprises a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), a deep dilated CNN, a deep recurrent neural network (RNN), a deep fully connected neural network, a deep generative model, a deep Boltzmann machine, a deep restricted Boltzmann machine, or a feed-forward neural network.
