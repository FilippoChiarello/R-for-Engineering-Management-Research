<title>
Detecting neuronal action potentials using a convolutive compound action potential model
</title>

<abstract>
A hearing implant fitting system includes a physiological database containing physiological data characterizing auditory neural tissue response to electrical stimulation. A neural action potential (NAP) measurement system measures NAP signals from cochlear tissue responding to electrical stimulation signals delivered by one or more of the electrode contacts, including: deriving a compound discharge latency distribution (CDLD) of the cochlear tissue by deconvolving: (1) a tissue response measurement signal taken responsive to the delivered electrical stimulation signals, with (2) an elementary unit response signal representing voltage change at a measurement electrode contact due to the electrical stimulation, and then comparing the CDLD to physiological data from the physiological database to detect an NAP signal from the tissue response measurement signal. A fitting display provides to the fitting audiologist a visual display representing the CDLD and the NAP signal for fitting the electrode array to an implanted patient.
