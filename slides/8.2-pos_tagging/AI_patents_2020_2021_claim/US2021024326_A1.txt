METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR ELEVATOR CROWD PREDICTION
</title>

<abstract>
A method for crowd prediction in an elevator system includes logging the number of calls across a period of time and generating a first time series for an average number of calls; collecting external influence data and generating a second time series for the external influence data; performing a cross-correlation test on the first and second time series; when a cross-correlation between the first and second time series is determined, performing a causality test on the first and second time series; and when a causal relationship between the first and second time series is determined, using the causal relationship to predict an expected number of calls in the elevator system.

<claims>
1. A method for crowd prediction in an elevator system, the method comprising: logging the number of calls across a period of time and generating a first time series for an average number of calls; collecting external influence data and generating a second time series for the external influence data; performing a cross-correlation test on the first and second time series; when a cross-correlation between the first and second time series is determined, performing a causality test on the first and second time series; and when a causal relationship between the first and second time series is determined, using the causal relationship to predict an expected number of calls in the elevator system.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the external influence data relates to one or more of: weather, epidemics, holidays, special events, urban transportation systems, and road traffic.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: performing a stationary test on the external influence data; and when the stationary test shows that the external influence data has a trend, de-trending the external influence data before generating the second time series.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: using the expected number of calls to predict an expected car occupancy level.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein predicting an expected car occupancy level further comprises: monitoring individual passenger journeys across a period of time; and implementing a machine learning process to identify passenger habits and further predict the expected car occupancy level.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein monitoring individual passenger journeys comprises: collecting passenger journey data using at least one of a sensor in a hallway and a sensor in car; and applying a time stamp to the passenger journey data.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the passenger journey data includes one or more of: a boarding floor, an intended destination floor, a deboarding floor, a passenger identification, and occupancy volume.
8. The method of claim 5, wherein monitoring individual passenger journeys comprises: recognising an individual passenger's identity.
9. The method of claim 5, wherein monitoring individual passenger journeys comprises: using a hallway sensor to identify an individual passenger and using a car sensor to re-identify the same individual passenger.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising: comparing the expected car occupancy level to an available car occupancy level; and issuing a crowd notification when the expected car occupancy level exceeds the available car occupancy level.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising: controlling dispatch and/or stopping of at least one car in the elevator system in response to the crowd notification.
12. An elevator system comprising: a monitoring system arranged to log the number of calls across a period of time and generate a first time series for an average number of calls; a processor arranged to: receive external influence data and generate a second time series for the external influence data; perform a cross-correlation test on the first and second time series; when a cross-correlation between the first and second time series is determined, perform a causality test on the first and second time series; and when a causal relationship between the first and second time series is determined, use the causal relationship to predict an expected number of calls in the elevator system.
13. The elevator system of claim 12, wherein the monitoring system is arranged to: monitor individual passenger journeys across a period of time; and implement a machine learning process to identify passenger habits and predict an expected car occupancy level.
14. The elevator system of claim 12, further comprising a crowd detection system arranged to: compare the expected car occupancy level to an available car occupancy level; and issue a crowd notification when the expected car occupancy level exceeds the available car occupancy level.
15. The elevator system of claim 12, further comprising an elevator dispatch controller arranged to: redirect an incoming call to another elevator car when the expected car occupancy level exceeds the available car occupancy level; and/or avoid stopping an elevator car when the expected car occupancy level exceeds the available car occupancy level.
