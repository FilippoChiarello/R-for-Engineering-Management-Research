SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AN AUTOMATED AND INTELLIGENT FRAC PAD
</title>

<abstract>
A system includes a built hydraulic fracturing system with a plurality of devices connected together and a simulation of the built hydraulic fracturing system on a software application. Additionally, a fracturing plan may be provided on the software application to include pre-made instructions to perform multiple processes in a hydraulic fracturing operation such as a sequence of valve operations to direct fluid flow through a selected path. Further, the fracturing plan may be modified to create a customized fracturing plan including the pre-made instructions and at least one modified instruction. Furthermore, the customized fracturing plan may be executed to perform at least one of the processes in the built hydraulic fracturing system.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method, comprising:
providing a template fracturing plan on a software application, the template fracturing plan comprising pre-made instructions to perform multiple processes carried out by a generic hydraulic fracturing system;
modifying the template fracturing plan to create a customized fracturing plan, the customized fracturing plan including the pre-made instructions and at least one modified instruction; and
executing the customized fracturing plan to perform at least one of the processes in a built hydraulic fracturing system comprising a plurality of devices.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising simulating performing the at least one of the processes in the built hydraulic fracturing system on the software application prior to performing.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising monitoring the performance of the
customized fracturing plan;
wherein monitoring includes collecting data from a plurality of sensors disposed
along the plurality of devices.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the executing is performed by sending instructions selected from the pre-made instructions and the at least one modified instruction to remotely operable hardware on the plurality of devices.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the pre-made instructions comprise a sequence of valve operations for each of the multiple processes.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises detecting a non-routine process interruption.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the software application generates at least one
additional instruction to modify the customized fracturing plan.
8. A method, comprising:
mapping a plurality of devices in a hydraulic fracturing system into a simulated
hydraulic fracturing system using a software application;
adding a new device to the hydraulic fracturing system, the new device comprising firmware;
mapping the new device into the simulated hydraulic fracturing system, comprising: casting a search for signals within a radius encompassing the hydraulic
fracturing system;
detecting at least one signal from the new device firmware; and
communicating the new device firmware with the software application.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the casting is initiated by the new device firmware.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the casting is initiated by the software application.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein the firmware has an application programming
interface (API) that produces a return message.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the firmware produces a pairing message.
13. A system, comprising:
a built hydraulic fracturing system comprising a plurality of devices connected
together;
a simulation of the built hydraulic fracturing system on a software application;
a fracturing plan provided on the software application, the fracturing plan comprising instructions to perform multiple processes in a hydraulic fracturing operation; wherein the instructions comprise a sequence of valve operations to direct fluid flow through a selected path.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the simulation of the built hydraulic fracturing
system shows the selected path of fluid flow for a selected process.
15. The system of claim 13, wherein the instructions further comprise permission requests from a human operator.
16. A system, comprising: a frac tree having at least one valve and being associated with a red zone surrounding the frac tree;
a manifold in fluid communication with the at least one valve and positioned within the red zone;
a control panel positioned outside the red zone; and
an automation box positioned within the red zone,
wherein the automation box is electrically connected to the control panel and to the manifold, and
wherein the automation box receives electrical power at a first level and outputs
electrical power to the manifold and a second level, lower than the first level.
17. The system of claim 16, further comprising a grease source positioned outside the red zone and fluidly connected to the manifold.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the manifold comprises one or more control valves configured to cause grease from the grease source to be injected into the at least one valve; and wherein the automation box transmits control signals to the control valves in response to control signals received from the control panel.
19. The system of claim 18, further comprising one or more sensors coupled to the at least one valve and in communication with the control panel.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein the control panel automatically identifies when to grease the at least one valve based, at least in part, on the sensors.
