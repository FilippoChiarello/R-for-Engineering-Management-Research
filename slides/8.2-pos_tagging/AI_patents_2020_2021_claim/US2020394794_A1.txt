METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RAPID DIAGNOSIS OF HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCY USING 3D QUANTITATIVE PHASE IMAGING AND DEEP LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
A non-label diagnosis apparatus for a hematologic malignancy may include a 3-D refractive index cell imaging unit configured to generate a 3-D refractive index slide image of a blood smear specimen by capturing a 3-D refractive index image in the form of the blood smear specimen in which blood (including a bone-marrow or other body fluids) of a patent has been smeared on a slide glass, an ROI detection unit configured to sample a suspected cell segment in the blood smear specimen based on the 3-D refractive index slide image and to determine, as ROI patches, cells determined as abnormal cells, and a diagnosis unit configured to determine a sub-classification of a cancer cell corresponding to each of the ROI patches using a cancer cell sub-classification determination model constructed based on a deep learning algorithm and to generate hematologic malignancy diagnosis results by gathering sub-classification results of the ROI patches.

A non-label diagnosis apparatus for a hematologic malignancy using three-dimensional (3-D) quantitative phase imaging and deep learning, the apparatus comprising: a 3-D refractive index cell imaging unit configured to generate a 3-D refractive index slide image of a blood smear specimen by capturing a 3-D refractive index image in a form of the blood smear specimen in which blood of a patent has been smeared on a slide glass or in a form in which the 3-D refractive index slide image has a single layer or a plurality of layers on an in vitro slide glass; a region-of-interest (ROI) detection unit configured to sample a suspected cell segment in the blood smear specimen based on the 3-D refractive index slide image and to determine, as ROI patches, cells determined as abnormal cells; and a diagnosis unit configured to determine a sub-classification of a cancer cell corresponding to each of the ROI patches using a cancer cell sub-classification determination model constructed based on a deep learning algorithm and to generate hematologic malignancy diagnosis results by gathering sub-classification results of the ROI patches.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising: a light source configured to have light incident on the blood smear specimen; an interferometer configured to obtain multiple 2-D holograms by measuring transmitted light diffracted from the blood smear specimen; and a measurement unit configured to measure a 3-D refractive index distribution of the blood smear specimens using the multiple 2-D holograms, wherein the 3-D refractive index distribution of the blood smear specimens is measured using the multiple 2-D holograms, measured by the interferometer, by rotating an angle of the light incident on the blood smear specimens.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising: a light source configured to have light incident on the blood smear specimen; an interferometer configured to obtain multiple 2-D holograms by measuring transmitted light diffracted from the blood smear specimen; and a measurement unit configured to measure a 3-D refractive index distribution of the blood smear specimens using the multiple 2-D holograms, wherein the 3-D refractive index distribution of the blood smear specimens is measured using the multiple 2-D holograms, measured by the interferometer, by directly rotating the blood smear specimens.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the 3-D refractive index cell imaging unit comprises: a 3-D patch image capturing unit configured to capture 3-D refractive index images capable of being captured at once in the form of the blood smear specimen in which the blood has been smeared on the slide glass; and a patch image connector configured to generate the 3-D refractive index slide image by connecting the 3-D refractive index images captured at once.

7. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the cancer cell sub-classification determination model determines the sub-classification of the cancer cell corresponding to each ROI patch by merging results of the deep learning algorithm to which the measured 3-D refractive index image has been input based on a probability.
8. A non-label diagnosis method for a hematologic malignancy using 3-D quantitative phase imaging and deep learning, the method comprising: generating a 3-D refractive index slide image of a blood smear specimen by capturing a 3-D refractive index image in a form of the blood smear specimen in which blood of a patent has been smeared on a slide glass or in a form in which the 3-D refractive index slide image has a single layer or a plurality of layers on an in vitro slide glass; sampling a suspected cell segment in the blood smear specimen based on the 3-D refractive index slide image and determining, as ROI patches, cells determined as abnormal cells; and determining a sub-classification of a cancer cell corresponding to each of the ROI patches using a cancer cell sub-classification determination model constructed based on a deep learning algorithm and generating hematologic malignancy diagnosis results by gathering sub-classification results of the ROI patches.
