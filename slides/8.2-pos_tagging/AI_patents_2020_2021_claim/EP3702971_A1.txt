</title>

<abstract>
The invention is concerned with a method for estimating the uncertainty of a recognition process (28) in a recognition unit (24), wherein the recognition unit (24) receives input data (26) describing at least one object (17) in surroundings (18) of the recognition unit (24) and generates output data (23) describing a recognition result concerning the at least one object (17), wherein uncertainty data (29) regarding the recognition result is determined, wherein a respective noise model (43) of a noise (44) is associated with nodes (33) of a predefined subset (42) of nodes (33) of a neural network (27) of the recognition unit (28) and starting from the nodes (33) of the subset (42) the noise (44) is propagated to the at least one output layer (32), wherein propagating the noise (44) comprises that at each node (n) that receives the noise (44) from its respective preceding nodes (35) the variance value (Vn) of the noise (44) of that node (n) is calculated from the variance values (V1 ,V2,Vk) of the respective predefined preceding nodes (35) by means of a predefined variance propagation function (P).
