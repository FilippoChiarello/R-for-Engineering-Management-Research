AN APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DETECTING AN INCIDENTAL FINDING
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a computer-implemented method for detecting an incidental finding in a radiology report associated with an imaging examination of a subject. The method comprises acquiring a first finding from the radiology report, the first finding being indicative of at least one of: an imaging observation, a disorder, and an abnormality identified from the imaging examination, acquiring information associated with the radiology report, wherein the acquired information associated with the radiology report comprises a reason for performing the imaging examination, a modality of the imaging examination, and a body part of the subject examined in the imaging examination, and determining whether the first finding is an incidental finding based on the acquired information associated wit the radiology report, wherein the incidental finding is an unanticipated finding not related to a diagnostic inquiry associated with the imaging examination.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computerimplemented method for detecting an incidental finding in a radiology report associated with an imaging examination of a subject, the method comprising:
acquiring a first finding from the radiology report, the first finding being indicative of at least one of: an imaging observation, a disorder, and an abnormality identified from the imaging examination;
acquiring information associated with the radiology report, wherein the acquired information associated with the radiology report comprises a reason for performing the imaging examination, a modality of the imaging examination, and a body part of the subject examined in the imaging examination; and
determining whether the first finding is an incidental finding based on the acquired information associated with the radiology report, wherein the incidental finding is an unanticipated finding not related to a diagnostic inquiry associated with the imaging examination,
wherein if it is determined that the first finding is an incidental finding, the method further comprises:
acquiring a clinical guideline, wherein the clinical guideline corresponds to the acquired information associated with the radiology report and comprises a decision support tool;
acquiring one or more features associated with the first finding, wherein each of the one or more features is indicative of a parameter of an observed element associated with the first finding; and
determining whether a follow-up action or a follow-up recommendation is required for the first finding, based on the acquired one or more features associated with the first finding and the decision support tool of the acquired clinical guideline.
2. A computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein acquiring the first finding from the radiology report comprises performing keyword-based matching using a predetermined list of keywords.
3. A computer-implemented method according to claim 2, wherein each of the predetermined list of keywords is extracted from at least one of domain knowledge and available standard ontologies.
4. A computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein acquiring the first finding from the radiology report is based on a trained model,
wherein the model is trained for identifying one or more findings from radiology reports, using at least one of machine learning processes and deep learning processes, and wherein the model is trained based on a plurality of human annotated radiology reports, each of the plurality of human annotated radiology reports comprising one or more findings.
5. A computer-implemented method according to claim 4, wherein at least one of the machine learning processes and deep learning processes is based on one of: logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks.
6. A computer-implemented method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the radiology report comprises a plurality of sections, each of the plurality of sections being associated with a finding or a type of information associated with the radiology report, and
wherein acquiring the first finding or the information associated with the radiology report comprises:
identifying a relevant section in the radiology report among the plurality of sections; and
using natural language processes to extract words and/or phrases from the identified section, wherein the words and/or phrases are relevant to the first finding or the information associated with the radiology report.
7. A computer-implemented method according to any one of the preceding claims, further comprising acquiring a clinical history of the subject, wherein determining whether the first finding is an incidental finding is further based on the acquired clinical history of the subject.
8. A computer-implemented method according to any one of the preceding claims, further comprising:
acquiring a second finding from a previously radiology report associated with the subject, wherein the second finding of the same pathological type as that associated with the first finding, wherein determining whether the first finding is an incidental finding is further based on a comparison between the first finding and the second finding.
9. A computer-implemented method according to claim 8, further comprising:
acquiring, for each of the first finding and the second finding, one or more features, wherein each of the one or more features is indicative of a parameter of an observed element associated with the respective finding,
wherein the comparison between the first finding and the second finding comprises comparing the one or more features associated with the first finding with the one or more features associated with the second finding.
10. A computer-implemented method according to claim 9, wherein a parameter of an observed element is one of: an anatomical location of the observed element, a size of the observed element, a shape of the observed element, margin information of the observed element, a degree of opacity of the observed element, and a texture of the observed element.
11. A computer-implemented method according to claim 10, further comprising acquiring information associated with the subject, wherein determining whether a follow-up action or a follow-up recommendation is required for the first finding is further based on the acquired information associated with the subject.
12. A computer-implemented method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the modality of the imaging examination is one of: a computed tomography scan, a magnetic resonance imaging scan, an ultrasound scan, and an X-ray scan.
13. A computer program product comprising a computer readable medium, the computer readable medium having computer readable code embodied therein, the computer readable code being configured such that, on execution by suitable computer or processor, the computer or processor is caused to perform the method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims.
14. An apparatus for detecting an incidental finding in a radiology report associated with an imaging examination of a subject, the apparatus comprising a processor configured to: acquire a first finding from the radiology report, the first finding being indicative of at least one of: an imaging observation, a disorder, and an abnormality identified from the imaging examination;
acquire information associated with the radiology report, wherein the acquired information associated with the radiology report comprises a reason for performing the imaging examination, a modality of the imaging examination, and a body part of the subject examined in the imaging examination; and
determine whether the first finding is an incidental finding based on the acquired information associated with the radiology report, wherein the incidental finding is an unanticipated finding not related to a diagnostic inquiry associated with the imaging examination,
wherein if it is determined that the first finding is an incidental finding, the processor is further configured to:
acquire a clinical guideline, wherein the clinical guideline corresponds to the acquired information associated with the radiology report and comprises a decision support tool;
acquire one or more features associated with the first finding, wherein each of the one or more features is indicative of a parameter of an observed element associated with the first finding; and
determine whether a follow-up action or a follow-up recommendation is required for the first finding, based on the acquired one or more features associated with the first finding and the decision support tool of the acquired clinical guideline.
