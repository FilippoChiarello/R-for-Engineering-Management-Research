A METHOD FOR DETERMINING SUITABLE KNITTING CONDITIONS OR THE FEASIBILITY OF KNITTING BY A COMPUTER USING A MACHINE LEARNING DEVICE AND A PROCESSING SYSTEM THEREFOR
</title>

<abstract>
For discriminating the feasibility of knitting by a knitting machine or for predicting suitable knitting conditions, a trained machine learning device is used. The machine learning device has explanatory variables comprising yarn property values and driving data of the knitting machine, and objective variables comprising feasibility of knitting by the knitting machine or feasible knitting conditions. The machine learning device outputs the feasibility of knitting by the knitting machine or the feasible knitting conditions from the machine learning device, in response to input of the yarn property values and the driving data of the knitting machine.
