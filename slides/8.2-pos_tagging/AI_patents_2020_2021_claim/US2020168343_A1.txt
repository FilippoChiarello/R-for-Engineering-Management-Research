DEVICE, SYSTEM, AND METHOD FOR CLASSIFICATION OF COGNITIVE BIAS IN MICROBLOGS RELATIVE TO HEALTHCARE-CENTRIC EVIDENCE
</title>

<abstract>
A device, system, and method classifies a cognitive bias in a microblog relative to healthcare-centric evidence. The method performed at a microblog server includes receiving a selection from a clinician, the selection indicating a health-related topic. The method includes determining evidence data of the health-related topic from validated information sources. The method includes receiving a microblog, the microblog associated with the health-related topic. The method includes determining a cognitive bias of the microblog based on the evidence data.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: at a microblog server: receiving a selection from a clinician, the selection indicating a health-related topic; determining evidence data of the health-related topic from validated information sources; receiving a microblog, the microblog associated with the health-related topic; and determining a cognitive bias of the microblog based on the evidence data.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the selection includes detail information for the health-related topic, an interest profile for the clinician being generated based on the health-related topic and the detail information.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: generating a curated graph based on the evidence data and the selection, the curated graph indicative of curated semantic relations of the evidence data and the selection.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the curated graph is a three-dimensional nodal graph.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the semantic relations are between an agent, an action, and a patient.
6. The method of claim 3, further comprising: determining weights of the semantic relations based on extraction libraries; and generating a weighted curated graph based on the curated graph and the weights.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: generating a microblog graph based on the microblog, the microblog indicative of microblog semantic relations of the microblog.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the microblog semantic relations utilize expanded vocabulary terms based on a deep learning-based neural word and phrase embedding operation to identify semantically similar words.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining at least one of a sentiment and an opinion of the microblog to identify a polarity and a subjectivity, respectively, associated with the microblog.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the cognitive bias is one of nonchalant, proponent, concerned, and paranoid.
11. A microblog server, comprising: a transceiver communicating via a communications network, the transceiver configured to receive a selection from a clinician, the selection indicating a health-related topic, the transceiver configured to receive a microblog, the microblog associated with the health-related topic; a memory storing an executable program; and a processor that executes the executable program that causes the processor to perform operations, comprising, determining evidence data of the health-related topic from validated information sources, and determining a cognitive bias of the microblog based on the evidence data.
12. The microblog server of claim 11, wherein the selection includes detail information for the health-related topic, an interest profile for the clinician being generated based on the health-related topic and the detail information.
13. The microblog server of claim 11, wherein the processor further generates a curated graph based on the evidence data and the selection, the curated graph indicative of curated semantic relations of the evidence data and the selection.
14. The microblog server of claim 13, wherein the curated graph is a three-dimensional nodal graph.

20. A method, comprising: at a microblog server: receiving a selection from a clinician, the selection indicating a health-related topic; determining evidence data of the health-related topic from validated information sources; receiving a plurality of microblogs, each of the microblogs associated with the health-related topic; determining a respective cognitive bias for each of the microblogs based on the evidence data; and determining an overall cognitive bias for an audience associated with the microblogs.
