PERSONALIZED PAIN MANAGEMENT AND ANESTHESIA: PREEMPTIVE RISK IDENTIFICATION AND THERAPEUTIC DECISION SUPPORT
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and compositions disclosed herein generally relate to methods of improving clinical and economic outcomes to address adverse effects related to anesthesia, analgesics, opioids, and inadequate pain relief. Embodiments of the invention relate to the association between genes, specific polymorphisms of genes, and non-genetic factors with inadequate pain relief and anesthesia-, analgesic, and/or opioid-related adverse effects. Embodiments of the invention can be used to determine and manage patient risk factors for development of adverse perioperative effects and can allow for personalized anesthesia and pain management for improvement of pain control and reduction of anesthesia-, analgesic-, and opioid-related adverse outcomes. These methods and compositions apply to non-surgical pain management with opioids. Therefore, patients who are genetically predisposed to risk of inadequate pain relief and/or serious side effects from anesthesia, analgesics, and/or opioids can be identified and individualized treatment plans developed for implementation by the clinician to improve clinical and economic outcomes.

<claims>
1. 1-20. (canceled)
21. A method for treating a human patient for post-operative pain, the method comprising the steps of a) obtaining a biological sample from a patient in need of treatment for post-operative pain, wherein the biological sample is obtained prior to administering an opioid analgesic to the patient; b) genotyping the biological sample from the patient to determine the patient's genotype at a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the ATP binding cassette C3 (ABCC3) gene identified by rs4793665, wherein the genotyping is performed using one or more of a PCR-based technique for nucleic acid amplification from the sample, gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and microarray hybridization; c) identifying the presence of a T allele at ABCC3 rs4793665 in the biological sample; and d) administering an analgesic selected from fentanyl, hydromorphone, codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, tramadol, ondansetron, dexamethasone, methadone, alfentanil, remifentanil, acetaminophen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), dexmedetomidine, clonidine, and combinations and derivatives thereof for post-operative pain to the patient having the allele identified in step c).
22. The method of claim 21, wherein the patient is a pediatric patient.
23. The method of claim 21, wherein the analgesic is selected from the group consisting of acetaminophen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), dexmedetomidine, clonidine, and combinations and derivations thereof.
24. The method of claim 21, further comprising receiving at least one non-genetic risk factor selected from the patient's race, sex, and obstructive sleep apnea disease status.
25. The method of claim 24, wherein the non-genetic risk factor is race and the race is selected from Caucasian and African American.
26. The method of claim 25, wherein the race is Caucasian.
27. The method of claim 24, wherein the non-genetic risk factor is obstructive sleep apnea disease status.
