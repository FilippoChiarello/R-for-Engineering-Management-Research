<title>
SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ESCALATION USING AGENT ASSIST WITHIN A CLOUD-BASED CONTACT CENTER
</title>

<abstract>
Methods to reduce agent effort and improve customer experience quality through artificial intelligence. The Agent Assist tool provides contact centers with an innovative tool designed to reduce agent effort, improve quality and reduce costs by minimizing search and data entry tasks The Agent Assist tool is natively built and fully unified within the agent interface while keeping all data internally protected from third-party sharing.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: executing an automation infrastructure within a cloud-based contact center that includes a communication manager, speech-to-text converter, a natural language processor, and an inference processor exposed by application programming interfaces; and executing an agent assist functionality within the automation infrastructure that performs operations comprising: receiving a communication from a customer; displaying text associated with the communication in a first field of a unified user interface; automatically analyzing the text to determine key terms associated the communication; automatically populating the key terms into a notes field of a call notes user interface; and escalating the communication to a supervisor for further action.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: querying one of a knowledgebase, a customer relationship management (CRM) platform/a customer service management (CSM) platform, and a database of customer-agent transcripts using the key terms; and displaying responsive results to the querying in a second field in the unified interface.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising automatically populating query results into the notes field of the call notes user interface.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising providing an editor in the call notes user interface to receive edits from the agent of the automatically populated key terms and query results.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the populated key terms and query results form a call summary for use by the supervisor to understand reasons for the escalation.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising highlighting the key terms in the unified interface.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving the communication as speech; converting the speech to text; and parsing the text for key terms.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the communication is a multi-channel communication and received as one of an SMS text, voice call, e-mail, chat, interactive voice response (IVR)/intelligent virtual agent (IVA) systems, and social media.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising providing an option to the agent to accept or reject the populating into the notes field of the call notes user interface.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the method is performed in real-time.
11. A cloud-based software platform comprising: one or more computer processors; and one or more computer-readable mediums storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more computer processors, cause the cloud-based software platform to perform operations comprising: executing an automation infrastructure within a cloud-based contact center that includes a communication manager, speech-to-text converter, a natural language processor, and an inference processor exposed by application programming interfaces; and executing an agent assist functionality within the automation infrastructure that performs operations comprising: receiving a communication from a customer; displaying text associated with the communication in a first field of a unified user interface; automatically analyzing the text to determine key terms associated the communication; automatically populating the key terms into a notes field of a call notes user interface; and escalating the communication to a supervisor for further action.
12. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising: querying one of a knowledgebase, a customer relationship management (CRM) platform/a customer service management (CSM) platform, and a database of customer-agent transcripts using the key terms; and displaying responsive results to the querying in a second field in the unified interface.
13. The cloud-based software platform of claim 12, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising automatically populating query results into the notes field of the call notes user interface.
14. The cloud-based software platform of claim 13, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising providing an editor in the call notes user interface to receive edits from the agent of the automatically populated key terms and query results.
15. The cloud-based software platform of claim 13, wherein the populated key terms and query results form a call summary for use by the supervisor to understand reasons for the escalation.
16. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising highlighting the key terms in the unified interface.
17. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising: receiving the communication as speech; converting the speech to text; and parsing the text for key terms.
18. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, wherein the communication is a multi-channel communication and received as one of an SMS text, voice call, e-mail, chat, interactive voice response (IVR)/intelligent virtual agent (IVA) systems, and social media.
19. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising providing an option to the agent to accept or reject the populating into the notes field of the call notes user interface.
20. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, wherein the operation are performed in real-time.
