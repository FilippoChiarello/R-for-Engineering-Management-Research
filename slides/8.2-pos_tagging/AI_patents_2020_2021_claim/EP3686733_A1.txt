CALCULATION PROCESSING APPARATUS, PROGRAM, AND METHOD OF CONTROLLING THE CALCULATION PROCESSING APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
A calculation processing apparatus includes: a first output unit configured to compare an input value with a boundary value and output a value equal to the input value when the input value exceeds the boundary value; and a second output unit configured to output, in a calculation of a rectified linear function by which a certain output value is output in a case where the input value is smaller than or equal to the boundary value, a multiple of a small value ε larger than 0 when the input value is smaller than or equal to the boundary value as an output value.

<claims>
1. A calculation processing apparatus comprising: a first output unit configured to compare an input value with a boundary value and output a value equal to the input value when the input value exceeds the boundary value; and a second output unit configured to output, in a calculation of a rectified linear function by which a certain output value is output in a case where the input value is smaller than or equal to the boundary value, a multiple of a small value ε larger than 0 when the input value is smaller than or equal to the boundary value as an output value.
2. The calculation processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the second output unit outputs as the output value a product of the input value and the small value ε.
3. The calculation processing unit according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the second output unit outputs the output value by inputting to a multiplying unit the input value as a multiplier and the small value ε as a multiplicand.
4. The calculation processing unit according to claim 1, wherein,
the second output unit outputs -ε, 0, or +ε as the output value regarding the small value ε.
5. A program for causing a computer to execute a process, the process comprising: comparing an input value with a boundary value and outputting a value equal to the input value when the input value exceeds the boundary value; and outputting, in a calculation of a rectified linear function by which a certain output value is output in a case where the input value is smaller than or equal to the boundary value, a multiple of a small value ε larger than 0 when the input value is smaller than or equal to the boundary value as an output value.
6. The program according to claim 5, wherein
a product of the input value and the small value ε is output as the output value.
7. The program according to claim 5 or 6, wherein
the output value is output by inputting to a multiplying unit the input value as a multiplier and the small value ε as a multiplicand.
8. The program according to claim 5, wherein,
as the output value, -ε, 0, or +ε is output regarding the small value ε.
9. A method of controlling a calculation processing unit, the method comprising: comparing an input value with a boundary value and outputting a value equal to the input value when the input value exceeds the boundary value; and outputting, in a calculation of a rectified linear function by which a certain output value is output in a case where the input value is smaller than or equal to the boundary value, a multiple of a small value ε larger than 0 when the input value is smaller than or equal to the boundary value as an output value.
10. The method according to claim 9, wherein
a product of the input value and the small value ε is output as the output value.
11. The method according to claim 9 or 10, wherein
the output value is output by inputting to a multiplying unit the input value as a multiplier and the small value ε as a multiplicand.
12. The method according to claim 9, wherein,
as the output value, -ε, 0, or +ε is output regarding the small value ε.
