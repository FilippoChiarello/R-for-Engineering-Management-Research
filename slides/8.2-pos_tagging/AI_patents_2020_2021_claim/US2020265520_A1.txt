PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING FOR GUARANTEED INCOME FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
</title>

<abstract>
A method and apparatus for acquiring and parsing data into categories responsive to receipt of at least one prospectus of a variable or non-fixed annuity contract for storage in an annuity master database. Once annuity contract data is received in the annuity master database, the data is analyzed and a recommended annuity contract value is forecast using one of trend-line projection and Monte Carlo simulation. A result is a filtering and listing of at least one recommended annuity or, further, a ranking of annuity contracts available from various carriers recommended for an annuity contract purchaser responsive to an annuity contract purchaser profile.

<claims>
What we claim is:
1. A method of parsing diverse documents including a prospectus for a variable or non-fixed annuity published by a carrier comprising: receiving the diverse documents and applying a natural language processor comprising an eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) parser, the XBRL parser categorizing like categories of annuity data for storage in an annuity master database of a cloud-based server, the annuity master database accessible to one of a carrier, a regulator and a self-side analyst; analyzing and forecasting contract values and benefit base roll-up projections utilizing one of a trend-line projection and a Monte Carlo simulation module; and filtering the contract values and identifying at least one recommended annuity contract available from a carrier responsive to annuity contract purchaser profile data.
2. A method as recited in claim 1 further comprising: calculating a guaranteed income benefit for one of a variable and a non-fixed annuity at a predetermined confidence level.
3. A method as recited in claim 1 further comprising: determining an expected rate of return on investment in one of a variable and a non-fixed annuity at a predetermined confidence level.
4. A method as recited in claim 1 further comprising: forecasting an annuity contract value including one of fees and step-up terms using one of a trend-line projection and a Monte Carlo simulation.
5. A method as recited in claim 1 further comprising: ranking at least two of one of a variable and a non-fixed annuity according to guaranteed income benefit at a predetermined confidence level.
6. A method as recited in claim 1 further comprising: receiving input contract purchaser profile data comprising at least three of risk preferences, estate planning, retirement data, assets and health data.
