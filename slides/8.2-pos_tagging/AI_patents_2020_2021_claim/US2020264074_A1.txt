STATE DETECTION SYSTEM FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE, DATA ANALYSIS DEVICE, AND VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
A state detection system for an internal combustion engine is provided. A detection mapping takes, as inputs, rotation waveform variables and a road surface state variable to output a combustion state variable. The rotation waveform variables include information on a difference between cylinders in the rotational speed NE of a crankshaft during periods in which the respective cylinders generate combustion torque. The combustion state variable relates to a level of variations in combustion state among the cylinders. A determination process performed by an execution device determines whether the internal combustion engine is in a predetermined operating state based on an output value of the detection mapping that takes, as inputs, values of the rotation waveform variables and a value of the road surface state variable.
