VEHICLE TO VEHICLE (V2V) COMMUNICATION LESS TRUCK PLATOONING
</title>

<abstract>
V2V communication-less truck platooning.
</abstract>

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for vehicle to vehicle communication less truck platooning, the method comprises: monitoring, by a truck monitor, an environment of the truck to provide monitoring results; determining, based on the sensed information, whether to engage in truck platooning with a set of at least one other truck; engaging the truck platooning following determination to engage in the truck platooning; wherein the engaging comprises at least partially autonomously driving the truck based on the monitoring results.
2. The method according to claim 1 comprising determining, based at least on the monitoring results, whether disengage the truck platooning.
3. The method according to claim 2 wherein at least one of the determining of whether to engage and whether to disengage is based on a risk level associated with the truck platooning.
4. The method according to claim 2 wherein at least one of the determining of whether to engage and whether to disengage is based on a comparison between the path of progress of the set and a desired path of progress of the truck.
5. The method according to claim 2 wherein at least one of the determining of whether to engage and whether to disengage is based on an assessment of a risk level associated with the progress of the set.
6. The method according to claim 2 wherein at least one of the determining of whether to engage and whether to disengage is based on an assessment of a risk level associated with road conditions.
7. The method according to claim 2 wherein at least one of the determining of whether to engage and whether to disengage is based on an assessment of a risk level imposed by an entrance of a vehicle between members of a convoy.
8. The method according to claim 2 wherein at least one of the determining of whether to engage and whether to disengage is based on a physiological state of a driver of the truck.
9. The method according to claim 2 wherein at least one of the determining of whether to engage and whether to disengage is based on at least one out of (a) a relationship between a type of the vehicle and a type of the certain truck, (b) a relationship between a size of the vehicle and a size of the certain truck, and (c) a relationship between a weight of the vehicle and a weight of the certain truck.
10. The method according to claim 2 wherein the engaging the truck platooning comprises engaging as a leading truck.
11. The method according to claim 2 wherein the engaging the truck platooning comprises engaging as a following truck.
12. The method according to claim 2 wherein the engaging comprises engaging the platooning at certain location, and then replacing locations with at least one other truck.
13. The method according to claim 1 comprising receiving commands conveyed over vehicle to vehicle communication, wherein the commands are for determining driving of trucks while engaged in the truck platooning.
14. The method according to claim 13, wherein the at least partially autonomously driving the truck is executed regardless of the commands.
15. The method according to claim 13, comprising analyzing an accuracy of the commands and generating an alerts when the commands are inaccurate.
16. The method according to claim 13, comprising analyzing an accuracy of the commands and disengaging when the commands are inaccurate.
17. The method according to claim 1 comprising dynamically determining am amount of control of the vehicle during the at least partially autonomously driving of the truck.
18. A non-transitory computer readable medium for vehicle to vehicle communication less truck platooning, the non-transitory computer readable medium stores instructions for: monitoring, by a truck monitor, an environment of the truck to provide monitoring results; determining, based on the sensed information, whether to engage in truck platooning with a set of at least one other truck; engaging the truck platooning following determination to engage in the truck platooning; wherein the engaging comprises at least partially autonomously driving the truck based on the monitoring results.
19. A system for vehicle to vehicle communication less truck platooning, the system comprises: a truck monitor that is configured to: monitor an environment of the truck to provide monitoring results; determine, based on the sensed information, whether to engage in truck platooning with a set of at least one other truck; and participate in engaging the truck platooning following determination to engage in the truck platooning; wherein the engaging comprises at least partially autonomously driving the truck based on the monitoring results.
