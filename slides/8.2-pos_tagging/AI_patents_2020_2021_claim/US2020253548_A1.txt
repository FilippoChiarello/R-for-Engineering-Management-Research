CLASSIFYING A DISEASE OR DISABILITY OF A SUBJECT
</title>

<abstract>
Presented are concepts for m classifying a disease or disability of a subject. One such concept comprises obtaining interaction data associated with a subject, the interaction data being representative of the subject's interaction with a movement-based input device. The interaction data is processed with a first machine learning process to determine a set of 5 characteristics for describing the subject. The set of characteristics is then processed with a second machine-learning process to generate a classification result for the subject. An instruction is provided to the subject for directing the subject to interact with the movement-based input device, wherein the instruction defines a challenge comprising a time-varying parameter.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for classifying mental and/or physical disorders exhibiting motoric symptoms, the method comprising: obtaining interaction data associated with a subject, the interaction data being multi-dimensional time series data representative of the subject's interaction with a movement-based input device: processing obtained interaction data with a first machine learning process to determine a set of characteristics for describing the subject, wherein processing the interaction data with a first machine learning process comprises processing the interaction data with a first artificial neural network adapted to learn features of the interaction data by mapping the interaction data to a lower dimensional vector representation (z) from which the interaction data can be reconstructed; processing the set of characteristics with a second machine-learning process to generate a classification result for the subject, the classification result being representative of a state or progression of a disease or disability of the subject, wherein processing the set of characteristics with a second machine-learning process comprises processing the set of characteristics with a second artificial neural network that is trained supervised on data (z) generated from the first artificial neural network and classification data (l) representative of known disease or disability states; and providing an instruction to the subject for directing the subject to interact with the movement-based input device, wherein the instruction defines a challenge comprising a time-varying parameter which requires the subject to change movement of the input device as time elapses.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein processing the set of characteristics with a second machine-learning process comprises: comparing the set of characteristics with classification data representing one or more associations between characteristics and disease states; and based on the result of the comparison, applying a machine-learning based classification process to the set of characteristics.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the classification result for the subject comprises an identification of class or value within a predetermined range of available classes or values for the disease or disability, and optionally wherein the identification comprises a numerical value.
4. (canceled)
5. (canceled)
6. (canceled)
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: assessing at least one of a medication program and treatment program for the subject based on the classification results.
8. (canceled)
9. (canceled)
10. A system for classifying mental and/or physical disorders exhibiting motoric symptoms, the system comprising: an input interface adapted to obtain interaction data associated with a subject, the interaction data being multi-dimensional time series data representative of the subject's interaction with a movement-based input device; a first machine learning unit adapted to process the interaction data with a first machine learning process to determine a set of characteristics for describing the subject wherein the first machine learning process employs a first artificial neural network adapted to learn features of the interaction data by mapping the interaction data to a lower dimensional vector representation (z) from which the interaction data can be reconstructed; a second machine learning unit adapted to process the set of characteristics with a second machine-learning process to generate a classification result for the subject, the classification result being representative of a state or progression of a disease or disability of the subject, wherein the second machine-learning process employs a second artificial neural network that is trained supervised on data (z) generated from the first artificial neural network and classification data (l) representative of known disease or disability states; and an output interface adapted to provide an instruction to the subject for directing the subject to interact with the movement-based input device, wherein the instruction defines a challenge comprising a time-varying parameter which requires the subject to change movement of the input device as time elapses.
11. The system of claim 10, further comprising: an analysis unit adapted to assess at least one of a medication program and treatment program for the subject based on the classification results and to generate an output signal based on the result of the assessment.
12. The system of any of claim 10, further comprising: a server device comprising the first and second machine learning units; and a client device comprising a display unit.
13. The system of claim 10, further comprising: a client device comprising at least one of the first and second machine learning units and a display unit.
14. A computer program product comprising instructions to cause a system to execute the steps of claim 1.
15. A computer-readable medium having stored thereon the computer program of claim 13.
