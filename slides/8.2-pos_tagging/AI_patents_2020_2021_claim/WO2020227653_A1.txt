ADAPTATION LAYER ENHANCEMENT IN RELAY NETWORKS
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are methods, systems, apparatus, and computer programs for adaptation layer enhancements in new radio (NR) integrated access and backhaul (IAB) networks. In one aspect, a method includes performing, by an adaptation layer of an IAB node of the IAB network, header compression on one or more headers of a packet for transmission in the IAB network; and transmitting the packet with the one or more compressed headers to a destination IAB node of the IAB network.

<claims>
What is claimed is: 1. In an integrated access and backhaul (IAB) network comprising an IAB node, a method comprising:
performing, by an adaptation layer of the IAB node, header compression on one or more headers of a packet for transmission in the IAB network; and
transmitting the packet with the one or more compressed headers to a destination IAB node. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the packet is transmitted via a user equipment (UE) bearer, and wherein the IAB network implements UE bearer to backhaul channel mapping and routing. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more headers are at least one of a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Tunneling Protocol (GTP) header, a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) header, or an Internet Protocol (IP) header. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein performing header compression on the one or more headers comprises compressing a message type field in the one or more headers. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein the header compression is based on a Robust Header Compression (ROHC) framework, and wherein the header compression is performed using an ROHC compression profile. 6. The method of claim 5, wherein performing header compression on the one or more headers comprises:
determining a load status of the IAB network with respect to a number of contexts required by UE bearers served by the IAB network; and
determining, based on the load status, a context identifier of an ROHC channel, wherein a number of bits of the context identifier is one of 8 bits, 16 bits, or 24 bits.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein an ROHC channel corresponds to an end-to-end backhaul link between the IAB node and the destination IAB node, and wherein the method further comprises:
determining, based on the context identifier, a routing path ID of the end-to-end backhaul link, wherein the routing path ID identifies each hop in the end‐to‐end backhaul link between the IAB node and the destination IAB node. 8. The method of claim 1, wherein the packet is transmitted over an end‐to‐end backhaul link between an IAB-Donor and an IAB access node, wherein the IAB node is one of the IAB-Donor and the IAB access node, and wherein the destination IAB node is the other one of the IAB-Donor and the IAB access node. 9. The method of claim 8, wherein the IAB network further comprises an intermediate node between the IAB-Donor and the IAB access node, and wherein the method further comprises:
routing the packet through adaptation layers of the intermediate IAB node and the IAB-Donor node, wherein the packet is routed through the adaptation layers without going through the upper Internet Protocol (IP) layer. 10. The method of claim 8, wherein the one or more headers are at least one of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) header or an Internet Protocol (IP) header, and wherein the header compression of the UDP header or the IP header is UDP/IP header compression that uses a Robust Header Compression (ROHC) framework. 11. The method of claim 10, wherein the one or more headers further comprises a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Tunneling Protocol (GTP) header, and wherein the UDP/IP header compression is aggregated with GTP header compression. 12. The method of claim 11, further comprising:
categorizing GTP header fields based on the ROHC framework by assigning each GTP header field to one of the following categories: INFERRED, STATIC, STATIC-DEF, STATIC-KNOWN, and CHANGING.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the header compression is configured independently over a respective backhaul link in each hop between the IAB node and the destination IAB node. 14. The method of claim 13, further comprising determining respective compression efficiencies for the backhaul links between the IAB node and the destination IAB node. 15. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
determining, based the respective compression efficiency of a first backhaul link, whether to perform header compression over the first backhaul link. 16. In an integrated access and backhaul (IAB) network comprising an IAB node, a non-transitory computer-readable storage device having stored thereon the instructions, which, when executed by a data processing apparatus, cause the data processing apparatus to perform operations comprising:
performing, by an adaptation layer of the IAB node, header compression on one or more headers of a packet for transmission in the IAB network; and
transmitting the packet with the one or more compressed headers to a destination IAB node. 17. The non-transitory computer-readable storage device of claim 16, wherein the one or more headers are at least one of a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Tunneling Protocol (GTP) header, a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) header, or an Internet Protocol (IP) header. 18. The non-transitory computer-readable storage device of claim 16, wherein performing header compression on the one or more headers comprises compressing a message type field in the one or more headers. 19. The non-transitory computer-readable storage device of claim 16, wherein the header compression is based on a Robust Header Compression (ROHC) framework, and wherein the header compression is performed using an ROHC compression profile.
20. An integrated access and backhaul (IAB) system comprising:
an IAB node; and
one or more processors and one or more storage devices storing instructions that are operable, when executed by the one or more processors, to cause the one or more processors to perform operations comprising:
performing, by an adaptation layer of the IAB node, header compression on one or more headers of a packet for transmission in the IAB network; and
transmitting the packet with the one or more compressed headers to a destination IAB node.
