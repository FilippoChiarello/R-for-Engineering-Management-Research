ST-graph learning based decision for autonomous driving vehicle
</title>

<abstract>
In one embodiment, a data processing system for an autonomous driving vehicle (ADV) includes a processor, and a memory coupled to the processor to store instructions, which when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform operations. The operations include generating a station-time (ST) graph based on perception data obtained from one or more sensors of the ADV, the ST graph including representing a location of an obstacle at different points in time, obtaining a tensor based on the ST graph, the tensor including a plurality of layers, the plurality of layers including a first layer having data representing one or more obstacles on a path in which the ADV is moving, applying a machine-learning model to the plurality of layers of the tensor to generate a plurality of numerical values, the plurality of numerical values defining a potential path trajectory of the ADV, and determining a path trajectory of the ADV based on the plurality of numerical values.
