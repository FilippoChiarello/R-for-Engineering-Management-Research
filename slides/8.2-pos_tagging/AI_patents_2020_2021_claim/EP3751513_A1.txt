ADAPTIVE IMAGE PROCESSING IN ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE IMAGING MODALITIES
</title>

<abstract>
Adaptive image processing, image analysis, pattern recognition, and time-to-event prediction in various imaging modalities associated with assisted reproductive technology. The reference image may be processed according to one or more adaptive processing frameworks for de-speckling or noise processing of ultrasound images. The subject image is processed according to various computer vision techniques for object detection, recognition, annotation, segmentation, and classification of reproductive anatomy, such as follicles, ovaries and the uterus. An image processing framework may also analyze secondary data along with subject image data to analyze time-to-event progression of the subject image.

<claims>
1. A method for digital image analysis in assisted reproductive technologies, the method comprising: obtaining one or more digital images of a reproductive anatomy of a patient through one or more imaging modalities; processing the one or more digital images to detect one or more reproductive anatomical structures; processing the one or more digital images to annotate, segment, or classify one or more anatomical features of the one or more reproductive anatomical structures; analyzing the one or more anatomical features according to at least one linear or non-linear framework; and, predicting at least one time-to-event outcome of an assisted reproductive procedure according to the at least one linear or non-linear framework, the at least one time-to-event outcome comprising an egg retrieval date.
2. The method of claim 1 further comprising processing the one or more digital images to measure a volume of one or more ovarian follicles of the patient.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, further comprising determining a growth pattern of one or more ovarian follicles of the patient.
4. The method of claim 1, 2 or 3, further comprising generating one or more clinical recommendations associated with the assisted reproductive procedure, the one or more clinical recommendations comprising a recommendation for timing of egg retrieval.
5. The method of claim 2 further comprising determining a follicular maturity date of the one or more ovarian follicles of the patient.
6. The method of claim 4 wherein the one or more clinical recommendations comprise a recommendation for quantity and timing for embryo fertilization comprising standard insemination and intra cytoplasmic sperm injection.
7. The method of claim 4 wherein the one or more clinical recommendations comprise a recommendation for quantity and timing for embryo cryopreservation.
8. The method of any preceding claim, wherein: the obtaining comprises obtaining ovarian ultrasound images of a subject's ovarian follicles using an ultrasound device; analyzing, according to at least one linear or non-linear framework, the obtained ovarian ultrasound images to annotate, segment, or classify one or more anatomical features of the subject's ovarian follicles to predict a time-to-event outcome, the time-to-event outcome comprising an egg retrieval date; and optionally, generating one or more clinical recommendations for an assisted reproductive procedure, the one or more clinical recommendations comprising a recommendation for timing of egg retrieval.
9. The method of claim 8 further comprising: obtaining reproductive physiology data of the subject; and, analyzing, according to the at least one linear or non-linear framework, the reproductive physiology data and the ovarian ultrasound images to predict the time-to-event outcome.
10. The method of claim 8 or 9 further comprising: obtaining environmental data related to a subject's reproductive cycle; and, analyzing, according to the at least one linear or non-linear framework, the environmental data and the ovarian ultrasound images to predict the time-to-event outcome.
11. The method of claim 8, 9 or 10 further comprising: obtaining a subject's electronic medical record; and, analyzing, according to the at least one linear or non-linear framework, the subject's electronic medical record and the ovarian ultrasound images to predict the time-to-event outcome.
12. The method of any one of claims 8 to 11, further comprising: obtaining an anonymized third-party electronic medical record; and, analyzing, according to the at least one linear or non-linear framework, the anonymized third-party electronic medical record and the ovarian ultrasound images to predict the time-to-event outcome.
13. An apparatus for digital image analysis in assisted reproductive technologies, said apparatus comprising a means for performing a method for digital image analysis according to any one of claims 1 to 12.
14. A system comprising at least one processor and at least one non-transitory computer-readable medium communicably engaged with the at least one processor, wherein the at least one non-transitory computer-readable medium comprises one or more computer-executable instructions stored thereon that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to execute one or more operations of a method for digital image analysis according to any one of claims 1 to 12.
15. At least one non-transitory computer-readable medium for storing one or more computer-executable instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to execute one or more operations of a method for digital image analysis according to any one of claims 1 to 12.
