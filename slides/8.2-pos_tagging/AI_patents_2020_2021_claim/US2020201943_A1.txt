<title>
Sentence conversion system, sentence conversion method, and information storage medium
</title>

<abstract>
A sentence conversion system includes at least one processor that obtains data including a first type sentence and a second type sentence in association with each other, the second type sentence being a sentence obtained by converting the first type sentence into a second type in a same language, creates at least one converter that converts a sentence type in the same language based on the data and a machine translator that translates a first language into a second language, inputs the first type sentence in the at least one converter, and obtains a sentence converted by the at least one converter into the second type in the same language.

<claims>
1. A sentence conversion system comprising at least one processor configured to: obtain data which includes a first type sentence and a second type sentence in association with each other, the second type sentence being a sentence obtained by converting the first type sentence into a second type in a same language; create at least one converter that converts a sentence type in the same language based on the data and a machine translator that translates a first language into a second language; input the first type sentence in the at least one converter; and obtain the second type sentence converted by the at least one converter in the same language.
2. The sentence conversion system according to claim 1, wherein the at least one processor creates the at least one converter based on the machine translator using a statistical machine translation method.
3. The sentence conversion system according to claim 1, wherein the at least one processor creates the at least one converter based on the machine translator using a neural machine translation method.
4. The sentence conversion system according to claim 1, wherein the second type has a plurality of classifications, the data and the at least one converter are prepared for each of the plurality of classifications, the at least one processor: obtains data of each of the plurality of classifications, creates a converter for each of the plurality of classifications based on data of each of the plurality of classifications, inputs the first type sentence in a converter for at least one classification, and obtains a sentence converted into the classification in the same language by the converter for the at least one classification.
5. The sentence conversion system according to claim 4, wherein the at least one classification has a plurality of sub classifications, the data and the at least one converter are prepared for each of the plurality of sub classifications, the at least one processor: obtains data of each of the plurality of sub classifications, creates a converter for each of the plurality of sub classifications based on data of each of the plurality of sub classifications, inputs the first type sentence in a converter for at least one sub classification, and obtains a sentence converted into the sub classification in the same language by the converter for the at least one sub classification.
6. The sentence conversion system according to claim 1, wherein the first type has a plurality of classifications, the data and the at least one converter are prepared for each of the plurality of classifications, the at least one processor: obtains data of each of the plurality of classifications, creates a converter for each of the plurality of classifications based on data of each of the plurality of classifications, and inputs, in a converter for at least one classification, a sentence of the at least one classification.
7. The sentence conversion system according to claim 6, wherein the at least one classification has a plurality of sub classifications, the data and the at least one converter are prepared for each of the plurality of sub classifications, the at least one processor: obtains data of each of the plurality of sub classifications, creates a converter for each of the plurality of sub classifications based on data of each of the plurality of sub classifications, and inputs, in a converter for at least one sub classification, a sentence of the at least one sub classification.
8. The sentence conversion system according to claim 1, wherein the first type sentence is a declarative sentence, the second type sentence is a question sentence, the data is associated with a declarative sentence and a question sentence, and the at least one converter converts a declarative sentence into a question sentence in the same language.
9. The sentence conversion system according to claim 8, wherein the at least one processor: inputs a declarative sentence indicating a feature of an item in the at least one converter, obtains a question sentence converted by the at least one converter, the question sentence asking the feature of the item, and generates Q & A (Question and Answer) or FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) of the item based on the input declarative sentence and the obtained question sentence.
10. A sentence conversion method, the method being performed by at least one computer and comprising: obtaining data which includes a first type sentence and a second type sentence in association with each other, the second type sentence being a sentence obtained by converting the first type sentence into a second type in a same language; creating at least one converter that converts a sentence type in the same language based on the data and a machine translator that translates a first language into a second language; inputting the first type sentence in the at least one converter; and obtaining the second type sentence converted by the at least one converter in the same language.
11. A non-volatile information storage medium that stores a program for at least one converter that is created based on data and a machine translator that translates a first language into a second language, the data which includes a first type sentence and a second type sentence in association with each other, the second type sentence being a sentence obtained by converting the first type sentence into a second type in a same language, the program causing a computer to: in a case where the first type sentence is entered, obtain the second type sentence converted in the same language.
