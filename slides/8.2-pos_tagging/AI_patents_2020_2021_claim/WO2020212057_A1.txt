METHOD FOR DETERMINING CORRECTIONS FOR LITHOGRAPHIC APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a method for determining a correction for an apparatus used in a process of patterning substrates, the method comprising: obtaining a group structure associated with a processing history and/or similarity in fingerprint of to be processed substrates; obtaining metrology data associated with a plurality of groups within the group structure, wherein the metrology data is correlated between the groups; and determining the correction for a group out of the plurality of groups by applying a model to the metrology data, the model comprising at least a group-specific correction component and a common correction component.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for determining a correction for an apparatus used in a process of patterning substrates, the method comprising:
obtaining a group structure associated with a processing history and/or similarity in fingerprint of to be processed substrates;
obtaining metrology data associated with a plurality of groups within the group structure, wherein the metrology data is correlated between the groups; and
determining the correction for a group out of the plurality of groups by applying a model to the metrology data, the model comprising at least a group-specific correction component and a common correction component.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the model further comprises an apparatus component.
3. The method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the model comprises one or more group-specific correction parameters and one or more common correction parameters, wherein the parameters are coefficients of base functions representing a spatial characteristic of the correction.
4. The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the determining the correction comprises performing an optimization which optimizes the one or more group-specific correction parameters and one or more common correction parameters with respect to the metrology data.
5. The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the optimization comprises minimizing a cost function between the metrology data and a combination of base functions, wherein the one or more group-specific correction parameters and one or more common correction parameters serve as weighting factors of the base functions.
6. The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the optimization comprises optimizing a probability that the one or more group-specific correction parameters and/or one or more common correction parameters are optimal with respect to the metrology data.
7. The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the model is regularized to i) prefer correction parameters which are close to previously determined correction parameters and/or have a small absolute value, or ii) avoid degeneracy of a solution of the optimization. 8. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the determining the correction comprises application of a Weiner filter to the metrology data corresponding to a group other than the group for which the correction is being determined
9. The method as claimed in claim 8, comprising training one or more Weiner filters, each Weiner filter corresponding to a particular pair of groups of the plurality of groups.
10. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the metrology data comprises data measured over one or more previous lots, wherein a lot comprises one or more substrates, and the metrology data which is specific to at least one of the one or more previous lots does not comprise metrology data relating to one or more of the groups.
11. The method as claimed in claim 10, wherein the groups comprise groups categorized and/or ranked according to correction need, and metrology for obtaining the metrology data is scheduled according to the categorization and/or ranking.
12. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the metrology data comprises measurement data taken from multiple substrates, the multiple substrates having passed multiple different lithographic apparatuses, each of which imposes a different fingerprint on the substrate, and the common correction component at least in part relates to a common fingerprint component.
13. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the metrology data comprises one or more selected from: overlay data, focus data and/or CD data.
14. A computer program comprising program instructions operable to perform the method of claim 1, when run on a suitable apparatus.
15. A non-transient computer program carrier comprising the computer program of claim 14.
