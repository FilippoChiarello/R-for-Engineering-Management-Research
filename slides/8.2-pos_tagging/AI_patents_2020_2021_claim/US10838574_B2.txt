<title>
Augmented reality computing environmentsâ€”workspace save and load
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein are system, method, and computer program product embodiments for saving and loading workspaces in augmented reality (AR) environments. An embodiment operates by receiving a selection of an AR meeting space to open in a current physical location, wherein AR meeting space was previously configured for a remote physical location different from the current physical location. A selection of an AR meeting space to open in a current physical location is received. An arrangement of one or more digital objects of the selected AR meeting space is determined. A current anchor area within the current physical location that corresponds to a remote anchor area of the remote physical location is identified. The arrangement of the one or more digital objects of the AR meeting space is modified in the current physical location based on an alignment of the current anchor area with the remote anchor area.
