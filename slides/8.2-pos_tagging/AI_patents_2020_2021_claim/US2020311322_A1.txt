Systems and Methods for Generating an Energy Model and Tracking Evolution of an Energy Model
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for generating an energy model and tracking evolution of an energy model are disclosed. An example method comprises receiving material information and geometry information associated with a design model, and generating, based on the material information, geometry information, location information, and constraints, an energy analysis model associated with energy transmissions for the design model, wherein the energy transmissions are based on energy transmissions through surfaces of a plurality of model objects that collectively form the design model.
