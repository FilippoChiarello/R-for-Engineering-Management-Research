<title>
Methods for detecting and handling fall and perimeter breach events for residents of an assisted living facility
</title>

<abstract>
One variation of a method for detecting and handling falls by residents of a facility includes: receiving a notification for a fall event from a first resident wearable device associated with a resident; determining a location of the resident within a facility at a time of the fall; in response to the notification, distributing a fall response prompt to a set of computing devices, each computing device associated with a care provider; and, in response to proximity of the first computing device to the first resident wearable device, authorizing edit permissions for an electronic incident report by a first care provider exclusive of a second care provider.
</abstract>

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for detecting and handling events in a facility, the method comprising: at a first time, detecting an intervention event based on data received from a resident wearable device associated with a resident of a facility; calculating a location of the resident wearable device within a facility at approximately the first time; in response to detecting the intervention event, distributing an event prompt to a set of computing devices within the facility, each computing device in the set of computing devices associated with a care provider, the event prompt indicating the location; and in response to receipt of an event confirmation from a first computing device within the set of computing devices, deescalating the event prompt at a second computing device within the set of computing devices.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising, in response to confirmation that the first computing device is proximal the resident wearable device, authorizing edit permissions for an electronic incident report by a first care provider associated with the first computing device exclusive of a second care provider associated with the second computing device.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein deescalating the event prompt at the second computing device comprises, in response to receipt of the event confirmation from a first care provider via the first computing device: silencing the event prompt at the second computing device; and transmitting an indicator of response to the intervention event by the first care provider to the second computing device.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising, in response to absence of an event confirmation from a computing device within the set of computing devices within a threshold period of time following distribution of the event prompt to the set of computing devices, distributing a second event prompt to a second set of computing devices comprising a third computing device associated with a supervisor of the facility.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising, in response to absence of an event confirmation from a computing device within the second set of computing devices within a second threshold period of time following distribution of the second event prompt to the second set of computing devices, transmitting an alarm to an external emergency responder.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein: distributing the event prompt to the set of computing devices within the facility, each computing device in the set of computing devices associated with a care provider, the event prompt indicating the location, further comprises: for each computing device in the set of computing devices, requesting activity data from the computing device; selecting a set of inactive computing devices from the set of computing devices, the set of inactive computing devices characterized by low-intensity activity data; and distributing the event prompt to the set of inactive computing devices; and in response to receipt of an event confirmation from the first computing device within the set of computing devices, deescalating the event prompt at a second computing device within the set of computing devices further comprises, in response to receipt of an event confirmation from a first computing device within the set of inactive computing devices, deescalating the event prompt at a second computing device within the set of inactive computing devices.
