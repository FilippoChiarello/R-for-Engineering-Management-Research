SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DATA AUGMENTATION FOR TRACE DATASET
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for classification. In some embodiments, the method includes forming a first training dataset and a second training dataset from a labeled input dataset; training a first classifier with the first training dataset; training a variational auto encoder with the second training dataset, the variational auto encoder comprising an encoder and a decoder; generating a third dataset, by feeding pseudorandom vectors into the decoder; labeling the third dataset, using the first classifier, to form a third training dataset; forming a fourth training dataset based on the third dataset; and training a second classifier with the fourth training dataset.
