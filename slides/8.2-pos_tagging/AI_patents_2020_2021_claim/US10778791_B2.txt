Cognitive insight into user activity interacting with a social system
</title>

<abstract>
A current user activity of a first user interacting with a first social system can be monitored. A cognitive insight into at least one user activity of at least a second user relating to the current user activity of the first user can be generated. The cognitive insight can include a listing of user activity data, each representing a respective user activity of at least the second user relating to the current user activity of the first user. The cognitive insight can indicate, for each user activity data contained in the listing, a respective duration of time for which the user activity data is to be presented to the first user. The cognitive insight can be communicated to the first social system, which can present to the first user each user activity data in the listing for the respective duration of time indicated in the cognitive insight.
