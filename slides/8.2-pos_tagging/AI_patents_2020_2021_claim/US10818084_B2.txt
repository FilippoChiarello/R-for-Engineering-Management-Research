Dynamically customized three dimensional geospatial visualization
</title>

<abstract>
Using various embodiments, methods, and systems for implementing a dynamically customized three dimensional geospatial visualization techniques in a point cloud are disclosed. In one embodiment, a user's current area of interest can be determined to generate a dynamically customized three dimensional geospatial setting. In one embodiment, the area of interests can be determined based on a user's actions, behavior, and/or preferences. The geospatial (exterior or interior) settings or the content displayed within the settings can be dynamically customized in real time for each user.
