Material sorting using a vision system
</title>

<abstract>
A material sorting system sorts materials utilizing a vision system that implements a machine learning system in order to identify or classify each of the materials, which are then sorted into separate groups based on such an identification or classification. The material sorting system may include an x-ray fluorescence system to perform a classification of the materials in combination with the vision system, whereby the classification efforts of the vision system and x-ray fluorescence system are combined in order to classify and sort the materials.
