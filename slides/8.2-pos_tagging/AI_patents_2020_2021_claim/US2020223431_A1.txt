Controlling Vehicles Based on Whether Objects are Carried by Other Vehicles
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods and computer readable media for controlling vehicles in response to objects are provided. For example, one or more images captured using one or more image sensors from an environment of a first vehicle may be obtained. The one or more images to detect an object may be analyzed. In may be determined whether the object is carried by a second vehicle. In response to a determination that the object is not carried by a second vehicle, the first vehicle may be caused to initiate an action responding to the object, and in response to a determination that the object is carried by a second vehicle, causing the first vehicle to initiate the action may be withheld.

<claims>
1. A non-transitory computer readable medium storing a software program comprising data and computer implementable instructions for carrying out a method for controlling vehicles in response to objects, the method comprising: obtaining one or more images captured using one or more image sensors from an environment of a first vehicle; analyzing the one or more images to detect an object; determining whether the object is carried by a second vehicle; in response to a determination that the object is not carried by a second vehicle, causing the first vehicle to initiate an action responding to the object; and in response to a determination that the object is carried by a second vehicle, forgoing causing the first vehicle to initiate the action.
2. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the action comprises signaling.
3. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the action comprises stopping.
4. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the action comprises changing a speed of the first vehicle.
5. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the action comprises changing a motion direction of the first vehicle.
6. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the action comprises passing the object.
7. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the action comprises turning.
8. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the action comprises performing a U-turn.
9. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the action comprises driving in reverse.
10. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the action comprises generating an audible warning.
11. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the object is a third vehicle.
12. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the object is a road roller.
13. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the object is a tractor.
14. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the object is heavy equipment.
15. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the object is a scrap.
16. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the object is a dead animal.
17. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises: determining whether the object is towed by the second vehicle; and determining whether the object is carried by the second vehicle based on the determination of whether the object is towed by the second vehicle.
18. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises: determining whether the object is loaded onto the second vehicle; and determining whether the object is carried by the second vehicle based on the determination of whether the object is loaded onto the second vehicle.
19. A system for controlling vehicles in response to objects, the system comprising: at least one processing unit configured to: obtain one or more images captured using one or more image sensors from an environment of a first vehicle; analyze the one or more images to detect an object; determining whether the object is carried by a second vehicle; in response to a determination that the object is not carried by a second vehicle, cause the first vehicle to initiate an action responding to the object; and in response to a determination that the object is carried by a second vehicle, forgo causing the first vehicle to initiate the action.
20. A method for controlling vehicles in response to objects, the method comprising: obtaining one or more images captured using one or more image sensors from an environment of a first vehicle; analyzing the one or more images to detect an object; determining whether the object is carried by a second vehicle; in response to a determination that the object is not carried by a second vehicle, causing the first vehicle to initiate an action responding to the object; and in response to a determination that the object is carried by a second vehicle, forgoing causing the first vehicle to initiate the action.
