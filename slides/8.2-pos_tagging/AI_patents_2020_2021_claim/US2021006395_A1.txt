SEAMLESS ONE-WAY ACCESS TO PROTECTED MEMORY USING ACCESSOR KEY IDENTIFIER
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus including a processor comprising at least one core to execute instructions of a plurality of virtual machines and a virtual machine monitor; and a cryptographic engine comprising circuitry to protect data associated with the plurality of virtual machines through use of a plurality of private keys and an accessor key, wherein each of the plurality of private keys are to protect a respective virtual machine and the accessor key is to protect management structures of the plurality of virtual machines; and wherein the processor is to provide, to the virtual machine monitor, direct read access to the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines through the accessor key and indirect write access to the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines through a secure software module.

<claims>
1. An apparatus comprising: a processor comprising: at least one core to execute instructions of a plurality of virtual machines and a virtual machine monitor; and a cryptographic engine comprising circuitry to protect data associated with the plurality of virtual machines through use of a plurality of private keys and an accessor key, wherein each of the plurality of private keys are to protect a respective virtual machine and the accessor key is to protect management structures of the plurality of virtual machines; and wherein the processor is to provide, to the virtual machine monitor, direct read access to the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines through the accessor key and indirect write access to the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines through a secure software module.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the management structures comprise page tables mapping guest physical addresses to physical addresses of a memory.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the cryptographic engine is to provide, through the accessor key, integrity protection of the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the cryptographic engine is to encrypt, through the accessor key, the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processor is to issue a page fault responsive to the virtual machine monitor attempting to write directly to the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the cryptographic engine is to return poisoned data responsive to the virtual machine monitor attempting to access private data of a virtual machine using the accessor key.
7. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the cryptographic engine is to set a trust domain bit for writes using a private key of the plurality of private keys and to not set the trust domain bit for writes using the accessor key.
8. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processor comprises a register to specify which key identifier of a key identifier space is an identifier of the accessor key.
9. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a memory to store encrypted program instructions and data of the plurality of virtual machines.
10. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising one or more of a battery communicatively coupled to the processor, a display communicatively coupled to the processor, or a network interface communicatively coupled to the processor.
11. A method comprising: executing instructions of a plurality of virtual machines and a virtual machine monitor; protecting data associated with the plurality of virtual machines through use of a plurality of private keys and an accessor key, wherein each of the plurality of private keys are to protect a respective virtual machine and the accessor key is to protect management structures of the plurality of virtual machines; and providing, to the virtual machine monitor, direct read access to the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines through the accessor key and indirect write access to the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines through a secure software module.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the management structures comprise page tables mapping guest physical addresses to physical addresses of a memory.
13. The method of claim 11, further comprising providing, through the accessor key, integrity protection of the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines.
14. The method of claim 11, further comprising encrypting, through the accessor key, the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines.
15. The method of claim 11, further comprising issuing a page fault responsive to the virtual machine monitor attempting to write directly to the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines.
16. One or more non-transitory computer-readable media with code stored thereon, wherein the code is executable to cause a machine to: protect data associated with a plurality of virtual machines through use of a plurality of private keys and an accessor key, wherein each of the plurality of private keys are to protect a respective virtual machine and the accessor key is to protect management structures of the plurality of virtual machines; and provide, to a virtual machine monitor, direct read access to the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines through the accessor key and indirect write access to the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines through a secure software module.
17. The one or more computer-readable media of claim 16, wherein the management structures comprise page tables mapping guest physical addresses to physical addresses of a memory.
18. The one or more computer-readable media of claim 16, wherein the code is executable to cause a machine to provide, through the accessor key, integrity protection of the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines.
19. The one or more computer-readable media of claim 16, wherein the code is executable to cause a machine to encrypt, through the accessor key, the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines.
20. The one or more computer-readable media of claim 16, wherein the code is executable to cause the machine to issue a page fault responsive to the virtual machine monitor attempting to write directly to the management structures of the plurality of virtual machines.
