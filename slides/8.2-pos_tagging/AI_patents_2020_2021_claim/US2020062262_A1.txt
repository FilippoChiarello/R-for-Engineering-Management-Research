Vehicle action control
</title>

<abstract>
One or more target areas are identified proximate to a moving vehicle. The vehicle can be maneuvered to a target area selected according to a reinforcement learning reward function.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer comprising a processor and a memory, the memory storing instructions executable by the processor to: identify one or more target areas proximate to a moving vehicle; and maneuver the vehicle to a target area selected according to a reinforcement learning reward function.
2. The computer of claim 1, wherein the reward function is developed to optimize vehicle speed.
3. The computer of claim 1, wherein the reward function includes a penalty for safety risk.
4. The computer of claim 1, wherein the reward function evaluates a relative velocity of a second vehicle to specify a reward.
5. The computer of claim 1, wherein the reward function evaluates a length of the target area.
6. The computer of claim 1, wherein the one or more target areas are specified according to a maximum longitudinal distance on a roadway.
7. The computer of claim 1, wherein the one or more target areas are specified according to a boundary of at least one second vehicle.
8. The computer of claim 1, wherein the one or more target areas include target areas in a plurality of lanes on a roadway.
9. The computer of claim 1, wherein the instructions further include instructions to determine that the moving vehicle is moving above a predetermined velocity threshold prior to selecting the target area.
10. A method, comprising: identifying one or more target areas proximate to a moving vehicle; and maneuvering the vehicle to a target area selected according to a reinforcement learning reward function.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the reward function is developed to optimize vehicle speed.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein the reward function includes a penalty for safety risk.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein the reward function evaluates a relative velocity of a second vehicle to specify a reward.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein the reward function evaluates a length of the target area.
15. The method of claim 10, wherein the one or more target areas are specified according to a maximum longitudinal distance on a roadway.
16. The method of claim 10, wherein the one or more target areas are specified according to a boundary of at least one second vehicle.
17. The method of claim 10, wherein the one or more target areas include target areas in a plurality of lanes on a roadway.
18. The method of claim 10, further comprising determining that the moving vehicle is moving above a predetermined velocity threshold prior to selecting the target area.
19. A vehicle, comprising: a sensor providing data about an area around the vehicle; and a computer comprising a processor and a memory, the memory storing instructions executable by the processor to: based on data from the sensor, identify one or more target areas proximate to a moving vehicle; and maneuver the vehicle to a target area selected according to a reinforcement learning reward function.
20. The vehicle of claim 19, wherein the one or more target areas include target areas in a plurality of lanes on a roadway.
