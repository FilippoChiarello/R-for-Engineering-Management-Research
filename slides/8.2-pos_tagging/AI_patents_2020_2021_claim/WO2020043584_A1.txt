SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CREATING GUIDELINE-BASED SUMMARIES FOR IMAGING EXAMS
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method creates guideline-based summaries for imaging exams. The method includes extracting clinical concepts from a patient medical record to create a patient profile. The method includes identifying an appropriate use criteria based on a current clinical workflow. The method includes generating an appropriate use criteria summary including key elements from the patient profile which are used to determine a recommendation based on the appropriate use criteria. The method includes determining whether a user selected action is in violation of the recommendation.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising:
extracting clinical concepts from a patient medical record to create a patient profile;
identifying an appropriate use criteria based on a current clinical workflow;
generating an appropriate use criteria summary including key elements from the patient profile which are used to determine a recommendation based on the appropriate use criteria; and
determining whether a user selected action is in violation of the recommendation.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising, when there is a violation of the recommendation, generating an evidence summary including key elements that support the violation of the recommendation.
3. The method of claim 2, storing the evidence summary in a memory .
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the clinical concepts are extracted via one of a statistical approach, a natural language processing, and a machine learning.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying the appropriate use criteria includes identifying the current clinical workflow based on one of credentials of the user, an electronic system being utilized by the user, a study schedule, or an ordered procedure.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying the appropriate use criteria includes selecting the appropriate use criteria from a database of potential appropriate use criteria .
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the appropriate use criteria summary is organized based on one of a frequency of key elements, a decision-based flow diagram, a chronological order, clinical relevance and anatomy.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising filtering the key elements of the appropriate use criteria based on one of anatomical structure and exam modality.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the appropriate use criteria summary is generated using a pre-defined template stored in a memory.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving user inputs for editing the appropriate use criteria summary.
11. A system, comprising:
a non-transitory computer readable storage medium storing an executable program; and
a processor executing the executable program to cause the processor to:
extract clinical concepts from a patient medical record to create a patient profile;
identify an appropriate use criteria based on a current clinical workflow;
generate an appropriate use criteria summary including key elements from the patient profile which are used to determine a recommendation based on the appropriate use criteria; and determine whether a user selected action is in violation of the recommendation.
12. The system of claim 10, wherein the processor executes the executable program to cause the processor to:
generate, when it is determined that there is a violation of the recommendation, an evidence summary including key elements that support the violation of the recommendation .
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the processor executes the executable program to cause the processor to:
store the evidence summary in a memory.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the processor executes the executable program to cause the processor to:
extract the clinical concepts via one of a statistical approach, a natural language processing, and a machine learning .
15. The system of claim 11, wherein the processor executes the executable program to cause the processor to:
identify the appropriate use criteria by identifying the current clinical workflow based on one of credentials of the user, an electronic system being utilized by the user, a study schedule, or an ordered procedure.
16. The system of claim 11, wherein the processor executes the executable program to cause the processor to:
identifying the appropriate use criteria by selecting the appropriate use criteria from a database of potential appropriate use criteria.
17. The system of claim 11, wherein the processor executes the executable program to cause the processor to:
organize the appropriate use criteria summary is based on one of a frequency of key elements, a decision-based flow diagram, a chronological order, clinical relevance and anatomy .
18. The system of claim 11, wherein the processor executes the executable program to cause the processor to:
filter the key elements of the appropriate use criteria based on one of anatomical structure and exam modality .
19. The system of claim 11, wherein the processor executes the executable program to cause the processor to:
generate the appropriate use criteria summary using a pre-defined template stored in a memory.
20. The system of claim 11, wherein the processor executes the executable program to cause the processor to:
receive user inputs for editing the appropriate use criteria summary.
21. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium including a set of instructions executable by a processor, the set of instructions, when executed by the processor, causing the processor to perform operations, comprising:
extracting clinical concepts from a patient medical record to create a patient profile;
identifying an appropriate use criteria based on a current clinical workflow;
generating an appropriate use criteria summary including key elements from the patient profile which are used to determine a recommendation based on the appropriate use criteria; and
determining whether a user selected action is in violation of the recommendation .
