<title>
Applying configuration settings to a device
</title>

<abstract>
For a user group to which a first user is assigned, a plurality of configuration settings on client devices used by respective other users in the user group can be identified. A respective homogeneity score can be assigned to each of the identified plurality of configuration settings. For each of the respective configuration settings, at least one configuration setting value can be selected as a candidate configuration setting value based on, at least in part, the homogeneity score assigned to each configuration setting. The candidate configuration setting value for each confirmation setting can be communicated to a client device used by the first user, wherein the client device sets at least one of the configuration settings with a respective candidate configuration setting value.

The method of claim 1, further comprising: during a runtime phase that occurs subsequent to the client device setting the at least one of the configuration settings with the respective candidate configuration setting value, applying machine learning to identify at least one additional candidate configuration setting value; and communicating the at least one additional candidate configuration setting value to the client device used by the first user, wherein the client device sets at least one respective configuration setting with at least one additional candidate configuration setting value.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: identifying an additional configuration setting that requires a respective configuration setting value that is privacy sensitive; and assigning a respective homogeneity score to the additional configuration setting using a hashed value to represent the configuration setting value that is sensitive.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising: communicating to the client device used by the first user a message indicating at least one of the client devices used by the respective other users which has the configuration setting value that is privacy sensitive, wherein the client device used by the first user is configured to negotiate transfer of the configuration setting value that is privacy sensitive from the at least one of the client devices used by the respective other users to the client device used by the first user.
8. A system, comprising: a processor programmed to initiate executable operations comprising: for a user group to which a first user is assigned, identifying a plurality of configuration settings on client devices used by respective other users in the user group; assigning a respective homogeneity score to each of the identified plurality of configuration settings, the homogeneity score assigned to each configuration setting based on, at least in part, a homogeneity of the configuration setting among the client devices used by the respective other users in the user group; for each of the respective configuration settings, selecting at least one configuration setting value as a candidate configuration setting value based on, at least in part, the homogeneity score assigned to each configuration setting; and communicating the candidate configuration setting value for each configuration setting to a client device used by the first user, wherein the client device sets at least one of the configuration settings with a respective candidate configuration setting value.
9. The system of claim 8, the executable operations further comprising: determining each respective homogeneity score based on a number of client devices used by the other users in the user group that have a configuration setting value set for the configuration setting and a number of different distinct configuration setting values for the configuration setting among the client devices used by the other users of the user group.
10. The system of claim 8, the executable operations further comprising: for each configuration setting for which at least one configuration setting value is identified, assigning a relevancy score for each of the at least one configuration setting value, the relevancy score for each of the at least one configuration setting value indicating a relevancy of the configuration setting value to the user group; wherein, for each of the respective configuration settings, the selecting the at least one configuration setting value as the candidate configuration setting value further is based on, at least in part, the relevancy score assigned to the at least one configuration setting value.
11. The system of claim 10, the executable operations further comprising: determining each respective relevancy score based on a number of client devices used by the other users in the user group that have a configuration setting value set for the configuration setting and a number of times the respective configuration setting value is used for the configuration setting among the client devices used by the other users of the user group.
12. The system of claim 8, the executable operations further comprising: during a runtime phase that occurs subsequent to the client device setting the at least one of the configuration settings with the respective candidate configuration setting value, applying machine learning to identify at least one additional candidate configuration setting value; and communicating the at least one additional candidate configuration setting value to the client device used by the first user, wherein the client device sets at least one respective configuration setting with at least one additional candidate configuration setting value.
13.
