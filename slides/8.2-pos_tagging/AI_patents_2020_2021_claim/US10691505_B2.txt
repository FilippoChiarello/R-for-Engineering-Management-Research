<title>
Software bot conflict-resolution service agent
</title>

<abstract>
A bot conflict-resolution service agent (BCRSA) for addressing conflicts between bots in a target domain is disclosed. The BCRSA is configured to receive data from a target domain that includes changes made to a content of the target domain, analyze the data to identify a first change made to the content by a first bot and a second change made to the content by a second bot, determine based on the analysis that the first and second changes conflict, determine that the first and second bots are in conflict, select an amelioration action to be executed to resolve the conflict between the first and second bots from a plurality of available amelioration actions, and resolve the conflict by executing the selected amelioration action.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system comprising: hardware processor coupled with a memory device, the hardware processor configured to: receive data from a target domain, the data comprising changes made to a content of the target domain; analyze the data to identify a first change made to the content by a first bot and a second change made to the content by a second bot; determine based on the analysis that the first and second changes conflict; in response to determining that the first and second changes conflict, determine that the first and second bots are in conflict by determining that the first and second changes are made by the first and second bots automatically, by detecting that the changes made to the content are balanced reverts within a threshold difference and latency between successive reverts are within a threshold of time; and resolve the conflict by executing an amelioration action.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein in response to determining that the first and second bots are in conflict, the hardware processor selects the amelioration action to be executed to resolve the conflict between the first and second bots from a plurality of available amelioration actions.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein each of the first and second bots includes a rating and the hardware processor selects the amelioration action from the plurality of available amelioration actions based at least in part on the rating of each of the first and second bots.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the ratings of each of the first and second bots are determined based on a history of the first and second bots.
5. The system of claim 3, wherein the each rating defines a weighting that is applied to at least one of the plurality of available amelioration actions, and wherein the selection of the amelioration action is based at least in part on the weighting defined by each rating.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein actions of the first bot and the second bot are stored within a blockchain and tracked with the blockchain.
7. A computer readable storage medium storing a program of instructions executable by a machine to perform a method comprising: receiving data from a target domain, the data comprising changes made to a content of the target domain; analyzing the data to identify a first change made to the content by a first bot and a second change made to the content by a second bot; determining based on the analysis that the first and second changes conflict; in response to determining that the first and second changes conflict, determining that the first and second bots are in conflict by determining that the first and second changes are made by the first and second bots automatically, by detecting that the changes made to the content are balanced reverts within a threshold difference and latency between successive reverts are within a threshold of time; and resolving the conflict by executing an amelioration action.
8. The computer readable storage medium of claim 7, wherein in response to determining that the first and second bots are in conflict, the method further comprising selecting the amelioration action to be executed to resolve the conflict between the first and second bots from a plurality of available amelioration actions.
9. The computer readable storage medium of claim 8, wherein each of the first and second bots includes a rating and the amelioration action is selected from the plurality of available amelioration actions based at least in part on the rating of each of the first and second bots.
10. The computer readable storage medium of claim 9, wherein the ratings of each of the first and second bots are determined based on a history of the first and second bots.
11. The computer readable storage medium of claim 9, wherein the each rating defines a weighting that is applied to at least one of the plurality of available amelioration actions, and wherein the selection of the amelioration action is based at least in part on the weighting defined by each rating.
12. The computer readable storage medium of claim 7, wherein actions of the first bot and the second bot are stored within a blockchain and tracked with the blockchain.
