IDENTIFYING AT LEAST ONE OBJECT WITHIN AN IMAGE
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a computer-implemented method of identifying at least one object within an image, comprising the steps of: receiving a dataset of images, each image comprising a plurality of pixels and relating to at least one object; determining a sub-set of pixels within the dataset, wherein the sub-set of pixels provide a sparse representation of the dataset; training an artificial neural network based on the sub-set of pixels; receiving an image comprising a plurality of pixels, the image relating to at least one object; and using the artificial neural network, identifying the at least one object in the image.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method of identifying at least one object within an image, comprising the steps of:
receiving a dataset of images, each image comprising a plurality of pixels and relating to at least one object;
determining a sub-set of pixels within the dataset, wherein the sub-set of pixels provide a sparse representation of the dataset;
training an artificial neural network based on the sub-set of pixels;
receiving an image comprising a plurality of pixels, the image relating to at least one object; and
using the artificial neural network, identifying the at least one object in the image.
2. A method according to Claim 1 , further comprising the step of collecting weights from the trained artificial neural network.
3. A method according to Claim 1 or 2, comprising the steps of determining whether a weight is either greater or less than the mean of all weights in the network; and representing a weight in binary terms accordingly.
4. A method according to Claim 3, wherein using the artificial neural network comprises applying the binarised weights to the artificial neural network.
5. A method according to Claim 3 or 4, further comprising the step of saving the binarised weights to a memory.
6. A method according to any preceding claim, further comprising the step of training the artificial neural network based on a further sub-set of pixels providing a different sparse representation of the dataset, wherein the sparsity of the further sub-set of pixels is different from that of the sub-set of pixels.
7. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the size of the sub-set of pixels is no more than one-half, preferably no more than one-fifth, and more preferably no more than one-tenth the size of the dataset.
8. A method according to any preceding claim, further comprising the step of determining the size of the sub-set of pixels based on a required accuracy of identification.
9. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the sub-set of pixels provide a sparse representation of a non-linear transformation of the dataset.
10. A method according to Claim 9, wherein the sub-set of pixels comprises a dictionary and/or sparse codes, preferably a product of the dictionary and sparse codes; wherein the dictionary is a discriminative orthogonal dictionary
11. A method according to any preceding claim, further comprising, prior to training the artificial neural network, determining parameters of the artificial neural network based on the sub-set of pixels.
12. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein identifying the at least one object comprises obtaining a sparse representation of the image, preferably of a non linear transformation of the image.
13. A method according to Claim 12, wherein the sparsity of the sparse representation of the image is different to the to the sparsity of the sub-set of pixels.
14. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein identifying the at least one object comprises detecting and localising the at least one object.
15. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein identifying the at least one object comprises classifying the at least one object, optionally by comparison to a plurality of pre-determined labels.
16. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein identifying the at least object comprises tracking the at least one object, optionally by associating the at least one object with at least one bounding box.
17. A method according to any preceding claim, further comprising the step of moving a powered device based on the identified at least one object.
18. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein prior to determining a sub-set of pixels within the dataset, the dataset is transformed to mimic conditions of poor visibility.
19. Apparatus for identifying at least one object within an image, comprising:
means for receiving an image comprising a plurality of pixels, the image relating to at least one object; and
means for processing the received image, the means for processing comprising an artificial neural network configured to identify the at least one object in the image; the artificial neural network being trained based on a determined sub-set of pixels within a dataset of images, each image comprising a plurality of pixels and relating to at least one object, wherein the sub-set of pixels provide a sparse representation of the dataset.
20. Apparatus according to Claim 19, further comprising a data store for storing binarised weights for the artificial neural network.
