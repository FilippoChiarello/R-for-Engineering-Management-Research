PRESENTING DATA REGARDING GROUPED FLOWS
</title>

<abstract>
Some embodiments provide a novel method for receiving a plurality of attribute sets from a set of host computers, each attribute set associated with a group of one or more flows that is created by using a key to associate individual flows into the group of flows. The appliance, in some embodiments, merges two identified attribute sets into one merged attribute set and analyzes the merged attribute set to identify a set of properties of the flows in the groups of flows associated with the two attribute sets. In some embodiments, a visualization process includes identifying machines as members of groups and identifying machines that are connected. The visualization process, in some embodiments, also generates a graphical user interface that can be used to select groups of machines, domains, or individual machines and displays contextual attributes relevant to the selected group, domain, or machine.

<claims>
1. A method for providing a user with a visual representation of data related to machines executing on a plurality of host computers, the method comprising: aggregating flow attribute sets collected by flow-attribute collecting engines executing on host computers, each flow attribute set relating to flows exchanged between the machines, said aggregating comprising: discarding duplicate flow attribute sets reported by the host computers; and associating remaining unique flow attribute sets with machine identifiers identifying source or destination machines of the flows; associating each unique flow attribute set with a set of contextual attributes related to the flow attribute set, collected by context collecting engines executing on the host computers separately from the flow-attribute collecting engines, and provided by the host computers separately from the flow attribute sets; providing a first display of a plurality of machines and a plurality of flows between the machines; in response to a selection of a particular flow, providing a second display of a group of contextual attributes relating to the selected particular flow.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein each of at least a plurality of the flow attribute sets collected from each host computer in a set of host computers comprises attributes of two or more flows that match a key used to aggregate attributes of one or more flows identified at the host computer.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the set of contextual attributes comprises a set of groups associated with the selected particular flow.
4. (canceled)
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the set of contextual attributes comprises at least one of a central processing unit (CPU) usage and a memory usage.
6. 6-7. (canceled)
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the set of contextual attributes comprises at least one of a user identifier for a user related to the selected particular flow, a set of process identifiers for a set of processes executing on machines related to the selected particular flow, and an operating system identifier for an operating system of a machine associated with the selected particular flow.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the set of process identifiers further comprises at least one of a set of process metrics and a process version identifier for at least one process in the set of processes.
10. 10-12. (canceled)
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the providing the first display comprises providing the first display in a graphical user interface (GUI), the method further comprising receiving the selection of the particular flow through the GUI.
14. (canceled)
15. The method of claim 1 further comprising: providing a third display of a plurality of groups of machines; in response to a selection of a group of machines, providing the first display of the plurality of machines and the plurality of flows between the machines.
16. 16-17. (canceled)
18. The method of claim 1, wherein associating each unique flow attribute set with a set of contextual attributes comprises: using a group of shared attributes that appear in both the flow attribute set and the contextual attribute set to identify a relationship between the flow attribute set and contextual attribute set; and creating an association between the flow attribute set and the contextual attribute set.
19. The method of claim 1, wherein associating each unique flow attribute set with a set of contextual attributes comprises adding attributes from the associated set of contextual attributes to the unique flow attribute set.
20. The method of claim 1, wherein associating each unique flow attribute set with a set of contextual attributes comprises associating each unique flow attribute set with an identifier that identifies the associated set of contextual attributes.
21. The method of claim 1 further comprising: receiving a selection of a particular machine, and providing a third display of a group of contextual attributes relating to the selected particular machine.
22. The method of claim 1, wherein selection of the flow comprises a hover operation in which a cursor is moved over a representation of the flow in the provided first display.
