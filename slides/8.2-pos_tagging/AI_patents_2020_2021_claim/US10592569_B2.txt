<title>
Search guided by location and context
</title>

<abstract>
The subject disclosure pertains to web searches and more particularly toward influencing resultant content to increase relevancy. The resultant content can be influenced by reconfiguring a query and/or filtering results based on user location and/or context information (e.g., user characteristics/profile, prior interaction/usage temporal, current events, and third party state/context . . . ). Furthermore, the disclosure provides for query execution on at least a subset of designated web content, for example as specified by a user. Still further yet, a localized marketing system is disclosed that provides discount offers to users that match merchant criteria including proximity. A system for actively probing populations of users with different parameters and monitoring responses can be employed to collect data for identifying the best discounts and deadlines to offer to users to achieve desired results.

<claims>
1. A web search system comprising: a memory; a processor in communication with the memory, the processor operable to execute: a location component that limits a query to a geographic region surrounding the present physical location of a user, wherein a size of the geographic region being determined based at least in part on a selection; a context component that limits the query to context information based on user information in a user profile; a search component, in communication with the location component and the context component, wherein the search component identifies relevant web content in accordance with the query, wherein the query is modified by the geographical region and first context information; a filtering component, in communication with the search component, wherein the filtering component receives search results and reorders the results based on second context information and third context information, wherein the third context information is associated with one or more people associated with a group that includes the user, wherein the user is engaged in a same activity with the one or more people associated with the group, wherein the second context is at least associated with a location of the one or more people, and wherein the location is in or in proximity to the geographical region; and providing the reordered results for display to the user.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the location component includes a determination component that automatically identifies the location of a user based on data provided by one or more sensors.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the one or more sensors receive or retrieve one or more of GPS, Wi-Fi, RFID, proximity and acceleration data.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the location component includes a determination component that identifies at least one bounded region specified by the user.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the location component includes a determination component that determines a bounded region based at least in part on the query.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the user information identifies characteristics of the user including at least one of age, gender, ethnicity, education level and political affinity.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the user information includes maximum cognitive load or attention span that is employed to limit the amount of content provided at one time.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the user information includes one of previous searches and selected content.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the context component also filters the web content based on one of current events and temporal data.
10. The system of claim 1, a third-party component, in communication with the search component, wherein the third-party component alters the relevant web content provided to the user based on the third context information.
11. A method that facilitates interacting with web content comprising the following computer-implemented acts: identifying, by a processor, a location based on a present physical location of a user; identifying, by the processor, first user information based at least in part on a user profile; conducting, by the processor, a web search query based on a bounded region, including the identified location, and the identified first user information; receiving, by the processor, results from the web search query; reordering, by the processor, the results based on second user information and first context information, wherein the second user information is associated with a group comprising one or more people and the user and the user and the one or more people are engaged in a same activity, wherein the first context information is at least associated with a location of the one or more people and wherein the location is in or in proximity to the bounded region; and providing the reordered results for display to the user.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the web search queries are modified based on one or more of user age, gender, education, ethnicity, religion, and political affiliation.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the web search queries are modified based on historical click through.
14. The method of claim 11, further comprising filtering advertisements displayed with search results based on one or more of the identified location and the identified user information.
15. The method of claim 11, further comprising receiving a user-selected portion of a map that specifies the identified location.
16. The method of claim 11, further comprising determining the bounded region based on the identified location of the user.
17. The method of claim 16, further comprising adjusting the bounded region based on the query.
18. The method of claim 11, further comprising limiting the number of results returned based on user tolerance.
19. The method of claim 11, further comprising filtering search results based on a second context.
20. A system to facilitated web-based search comprising: a memory having instructions stored thereon; a processor in communication with the memory, wherein the instructions, when read by the processor, causes the processor to identify a present location of a user; identify a user context based at least in part on a user profile; limit a search query based on the identified present location; limit the search query based on an identified first user context-; receive results from the search; eliminate a search result from the received results; reorder the remaining received results based on second context information and third context, wherein the second context information comprises information associated with one or more people associated with a group that includes the user and wherein the third context information is associated with a location of the one or more people and wherein the location is in or in proximity to a geographical region where the user is located; and provide the reordered search results for display to the user.
