<title>
Electronic device identification system, apparatuses, and methods
</title>

<abstract>
A wireless device identification system including one or more sensors each having at least one software defined radio to receive signals transmitted between one or more wireless devices and a mobile wireless device, one or more processors, and one or more memory devices. The one or more memory devices having stored thereon instructions that when executed by the one or more processors cause the one or more processors to capture cellular information, Wi-Fi information, Bluetooth information, and local network information from the received signals. The instructions can include correlating the captured information to the mobile wireless device by creating a weighted edge relationship graph having a plurality of nodes, including a node corresponding to each of the cellular information, the Wi-Fi information, the Bluetooth information, and the local network information, and determining an association strength between each node of the relationship graph.

<claims>
1. A wireless device identification system, comprising: one or more sensors each having at least one software defined radio to passively receive signals transmitted between a base station and a mobile wireless device; one or more processors; and one or more memory devices having stored thereon instructions that when executed by the one or more processors cause the one or more processors to: capture an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and a Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) from the received signals; map the IMSI to the TMSI, including: capturing an uplink Radio Network Temporary Identifier (RNTI) and a downlink RNTI; mapping the uplink RNTI to the IMSI; mapping the downlink RNTI to the TMSI; and mapping the downlink RNTI to the uplink RNTI; and identify the mobile wireless device based on the IMSI.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein identifying the mobile wireless device comprises assigning owner information to the mobile wireless device based on a cellular subscription associated with the IMSI.
3. The system of claim 1, further comprising instructions causing the one or more processors to subsequently identify the mobile wireless device based on the TMSI.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein at least one of the one or more sensors includes multiple software defined radios.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the sensor is a first sensor and further comprising a second sensor positioned in a location of interest and having at least one software defined radio to receive second signals transmitted between a second base station and the mobile wireless device; and further comprising instructions causing the one or more processors to: capture the TMSI and the downlink RNTI from the received second signals; and identify the mobile wireless device based on the TMSI.
6. The system of claim 5, further comprising receiving third signals transmitted between the second base station and the mobile wireless device and instructions causing the one or more processors to: capture a second TMSI and the downlink RNTI from the received third signals; map the second TMSI to the downlink RNTI; map the IMSI to the second TMSI based on the downlink RNTI map to the uplink RNTI; and identify the mobile wireless device based on the second TMSI.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the received signals include a Noise Ratio (SINR) and a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) corresponding to the mobile wireless device; and further comprising instructions causing the one or more processors to: determine a location of the mobile wireless device based at least in part on the SINR and the RSSI.
8. The system of claim 7, further comprising instructions causing the one or more processors to: determine that the location of the mobile wireless device is within a geofenced region around the location of interest; and notify a user associated with the location of interest that the mobile wireless device is within the geofenced region.
9. A wireless device identification system, comprising: one or more sensors each having at least one software defined radio to receive signals transmitted between a base station and a mobile wireless device; one or more processors; and one or more memory devices having stored thereon instructions that when executed by the one or more processors cause the one or more processors to: capture an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and a Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) from the received signals; map the IMSI to the TMSI, including: capturing an uplink Radio Network Temporary Identifier (RNTI) and a downlink RNTI; mapping the uplink RNTI to the IMSI; mapping the downlink RNTI to the TMSI; and mapping the downlink RNTI to the uplink RNTI; and identify the mobile wireless device based on the IMSI.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the sensor is a first sensor and further comprising a second sensor positioned in a location of interest and having at least one software defined radio to receive second signals transmitted between a second base station and the mobile wireless device; and further comprising instructions causing the one or more processors to: capture the TMSI and the downlink RNTI from the received second signals; and identify the mobile wireless device based on the TMSI.
11. The system of claim 10, further comprising receiving third signals transmitted between the second base station and the mobile wireless device and instructions causing the one or more processors to: capture a second TMSI and the downlink RNTI from the received third signals; map the second TMSI to the downlink RNTI; map the IMSI to the second TMSI based on the downlink RNTI map to the uplink RNTI; and identify the mobile wireless device based on the second TMSI.
12. The system of claim 9, wherein the received signals include a Noise Ratio (SINR) and a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) corresponding to the mobile wireless device; and further comprising instructions causing the one or more processors to: determine a location of the mobile wireless device based at least in part on the SINR and the RSSI.
13. The system of claim 12, further comprising instructions causing the one or more processors to: determine that the location of the mobile wireless device is within a geofenced region around the location of interest; and notify a user associated with the location of interest that the mobile wireless device is within the geofenced region.
