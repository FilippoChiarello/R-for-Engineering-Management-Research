DETERMINING OPTIMAL MATERIAL AND/OR MANUFACTURING PROCESS
</title>

<abstract>
In some examples, a computing device may receive, from a user device, inputs specifying a performance parameter and at least one of a material or manufacturing process. The computing device may determine one or more manufacturing processes corresponding to the inputs, and may determine at least one of a machine learning model or a simulation model corresponding to at least one manufacturing process related to the inputs. The computing device may input information related to a plurality of candidate materials into the machine learning model or simulation model to determine a predicted property of the respective candidate materials related to the performance parameter. In addition, the computing device may compare the predicted properties with each other to select at least one of a selected material or a selected manufacturing process, and may send, to the user device, information related to the selected material or manufacturing process.
