<title>
MICRO-COHERENCE NETWORK STRENGTH AND DEEP BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION OPTIMIZATION APPLICATION
</title>

<abstract>
A subject's Default Mode Network is accessed through corresponding measurements of the Micro-Coherence Oximetry Network Strength (MCO-S). An associated MCO-S system (100) includes a wearable (102), a user device (112) and a processing platform (123). The wearable (102) collects subject information sufficient to enable monitoring and optimization of the subject's Default Mode Network include sensors such as pulse oximetry instrumentation and EEG electrodes to obtain brainwave data, oxygen saturation data, heart rate variability data, and galvanic skin conductance data. Information from the sensors may be communicated to a user device (112), such as a cell phone or VR headset. The user device (112) communicates with a remote processing platform (123) that may execute artificial intelligence functionality and other logic in connection with assessing the patient's micro-coherence network strength and optimizing behavior modification protocols in relation to attributes and objectives of the subject.
