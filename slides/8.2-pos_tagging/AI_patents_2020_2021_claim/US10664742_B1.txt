<title>
Systems and methods for training and executing a recurrent neural network to determine resolutions
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are methods, systems, and non-transitory computer-readable medium for training and using a neural network for subcluster classification. For example, a method may include receiving or generating a plurality of user data sets of users, grouping the plurality of user data sets into one or more clusters of user data sets, grouping each of the one or more clusters into a plurality of subclusters, training the neural network for each of the plurality of subclusters to associate the subcluster with sequential patterns found within the subcluster in order to generate a trained neural network, receiving a first series of transactions of a first user, inputting the first series of transactions into the trained neural network, and classifying the first user into a subcluster of the plurality of subclusters based on the first series of transactions of the first user input into the trained RNN.
