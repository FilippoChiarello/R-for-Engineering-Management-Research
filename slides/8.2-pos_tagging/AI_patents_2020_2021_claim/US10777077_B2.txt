Vehicle control device, vehicle control method, and storage medium
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle control device (100) includes: an imager imaging the vicinity of a vehicle; a position identifying unit identifying a position of the vehicle; and a crossing recognizer (132) recognizing the presence of a crossing ahead in running of the vehicle on the basis of the position identified by the position identifying unit and map information and raising a degree of certainty in the presence of the crossing ahead in running of the vehicle on the basis of an element of a specific color, which represents the presence of a crossing, included in an image captured by the imager.

<claims>
1. A vehicle control device comprising: an imager imaging the vicinity of a vehicle; a position identifying unit identifying a position of the vehicle; and a crossing recognizer recognizing a presence of a crossing ahead in running of the vehicle, on a basis of the position identified by the position identifying unit and map information, and raising a degree of certainty in the presence of the crossing ahead, in the running of the vehicle on a basis of an element of specific colors, which represent the presence of the crossing, being comprised in an image captured by the imager, wherein the specific colors comprise a first color and a second color, wherein the crossing recognizer raises the degree of certainty on a basis of: an alignment of the first color and the second color comprised in the image captured by the imager, a comparison of a first area ratio of a first area occupied by the first color and a first threshold, and a comparison of a second area ratio of a second area occupied by the second color and a second threshold, and wherein the first threshold is different from the second threshold.
2. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein, in a case in which the first color and the second color are arranged periodically and alternately in the image, the crossing recognizer raises the degree of certainty in the presence of the crossing ahead in the running of the vehicle.
3. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein the crossing recognizer instructs a headlight device of the vehicle to perform high-beam radiation in a case in which the presence of a crossing ahead in running of the vehicle is estimated on the basis of the position identified by the position identifying unit and the map information, and it is estimated to be nighttime.
4. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, further comprising: an object detector that detects an object in the vicinity of the vehicle by emitting light and receiving reflected light, wherein, in a case in which the presence of the crossing ahead in running of the vehicle is estimated on the basis of the position identified by the position identifying unit and the map information, and an illuminance of the surroundings of the vehicle is low, the crossing recognizer raises the degree of certainty in the presence of the crossing ahead in running of the vehicle, on a basis of a detection result of the object detector detecting the object.
5. A vehicle control device comprising: an imager imaging the vicinity of a vehicle; and a crossing recognizer recognizing a presence of a crossing ahead in running of the vehicle, on a basis of an element of specific colors, which represent the presence of the crossing, being comprised in an image captured by the imager, wherein the specific colors comprise a first color and a second color, wherein the crossing recognizer raises the degree of certainty on a basis of: an alignment of the first color and the second color comprised in the image captured by the imager, a comparison of a first area ratio of a first area occupied by the first color and a first threshold, and a comparison of a second area ratio of a second area occupied by the second color and a second threshold, and wherein the first threshold is different from the second threshold.
6. A vehicle control method executed by an imager, a position identifying unit, and a computer mounted in a vehicle, the vehicle control method comprising: imaging a vicinity of the vehicle using the imager; identifying a position of the vehicle using the position identifying unit; recognizing a presence of a crossing ahead in running of the vehicle on a basis of the position identified by the position identifying unit and map information; and raising a degree of certainty in the presence of the crossing ahead in running of the vehicle on a basis of an element of specific colors, which represent the presence of the crossing, being comprised in an image captured by the imager using the computer, wherein the specific colors comprise a first color and a second color, wherein the raising the degree of certainty comprises raising the degree of certainty on a basis of: an alignment of the first color and the second color comprised in the image captured by the imager, a comparison of a first area ratio of a first area occupied by the first color and a first threshold, and a comparison of a second area ratio of a second area occupied by the second color and a second threshold, and wherein the first threshold is different from the second threshold.
7. A computer-readable non-transitory storage medium having a program stored thereon, the program causing a computer, which is mounted in a vehicle including an imager imaging a vicinity of the vehicle and a position identifying unit identifying a position of the vehicle, to execute operations comprising: recognizing the presence of a crossing ahead in running of the vehicle on the basis of the position identified by the position identifying unit and map information; and raising a degree of certainty in a presence of the crossing ahead in the running of the vehicle on a basis of an element of specific colors, which represent the presence of a crossing, comprised in an image captured by the imager, wherein the specific colors comprise a first color and a second color, wherein the raising the degree of certainty comprises raising the degree of certainty on a basis of: an alignment of the first color and the second color comprised in the image captured by the imager, a comparison of a first area ratio of a first area occupied by the first color and a first threshold, and a comparison of a second area ratio of a second area occupied by the second color and a second threshold, and wherein the first threshold is different from the second threshold.
8. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein, the first color has a higher probability than the second color, of appearing in a place other than the crossing, and the first threshold is higher than the second threshold.
9. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein, the crossing recognizer does not raise the degree of certainty when the alignment of the first color and the second color, the comparison of the first area ratio and the first threshold, and the comparison of second area ratio and the second threshold, are not indicative of the presence of the crossing.
