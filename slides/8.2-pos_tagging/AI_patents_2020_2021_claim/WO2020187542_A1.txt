A CONCEPT FOR AUTHENTICATING A USER OF A MOBILE DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure generally relates to authenticating a user of a mobile device based on motion data of said mobile device. Embodiments provide a method, apparatus and computer program for authenticating a user, a mobile device comprising such an apparatus and a system. The method comprises detecting an outfit of the user. The method comprises analyzing a gait of the user using a machine-learning model using motion data of a mobile device as input to the machine-learning model. The analysis is based on the identified outfit of the user. The method comprises authenticating the user based on the analysis of the gait of the user.
</abstract>

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. Method for authenticating a user, the method comprising:
Detecting an outfit of the user;
Analyzing a gait of the user using a machine-learning model using motion data of a mobile device as input to the machine-learning model, the analysis being based on the identified outfit of the user;
Authenticating the user based on the analysis of the gait of the user.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the detecting of the outfit of the user comprises at least one of identifying shoes worn by the user and detecting a bag worn or carried by the user.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the method comprises selecting, based on the detected outfit, a machine-learning model out of a plurality of machine-learning models, each of the plurality of machine-learning models being provided for a differ ent outfit of the user and the analysis of the gait being based on the selected ma chine-learning model.
4. The method according to claim 3, wherein for each of a plurality of different possi ble outfits of the user, a specific machine-learning model is created and/or trained.
5. The method according to claim 3, wherein the detecting of the outfit of the user comprises identifying shoes worn by the user, the method comprising selecting the machine-learning model based on a type of the shoes or based on specific shoes owned by the user and/or wherein the detecting of the outfit of the user comprises detecting a bag worn or carried by the user, the method comprising selecting the machine-learning model based on the detected bag.
6. The method according to claim 5, further comprising identifying the bag, the method comprising selecting the machine-learning model based on a type of the bag or based on a specific bag owned by the user.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein the detected outfit of the user is used as input to the machine-learning model.
8. The method according to claim 1, wherein the method comprises monitoring a radiofrequency band to detect the outfit of the user.
9. The method according to claim 8, wherein the radio-frequency band is monitored to determine whether the user wears or carries a bag, to identify the bag, or to identify shoes worn by the user.
10. The method according to claim 1, the method comprising detecting a presence of a component of the outfit, the presence of the component of the outfit indicating that the user is in possession of the component of the outfit, the method comprising using the detected presence of the component of the outfit as a second factor in the authen tication of the user.
11. The method according to claim 10, the method comprising receiving a radio-fre quency signal from a transmitter device of the component of the outfit, the method comprising detecting the presence of the component of the outfit based on the radiofrequency signal.
12. The method according to claim 1, wherein the detection of the outfit is based on a further machine-learning model, the motion data of the mobile device being used as input to the machine-learning model.
13. The method according to claim 1, further comprising registering one or more com ponents of the outfit with the mobile device, the method comprising using the one or more registered components of the outfit to detect the outfit.
14. The method according to claim 13, wherein the one or more components of the outfit comprise one or more pairs of shoes and/or one or more bags.
15. The method according to claim 1, the method comprising creating a new machine learning model after registering a component of the outfit, the method comprising training the new machine-learning model based on motion data of the mobile device that is obtained while the user wears or carries the newly registered component of the outfit.
16. The method according to claim 1, wherein the gait of the user is continuously ana lyzed using the machine-learning model and the user is continuously authenticated based on the continuous analysis of the gait of the user
or wherein the analysis of the gait of the user is triggered by a request for authentica tion, the analysis of the gait of the user being based on accumulated motion data of the mobile device, the accumulated motion data comprising motion data of a pre-defined time interval prior to the request for authentication.
17. A computer program having a program code for performing the method according to claim 1, when the computer program is executed on a computer, a processor, or a programmable hardware component.
18. Apparatus for authenticating a user, the apparatus comprising:
Circuitry configured to:
Obtain motion data from a sensor of a mobile device,
Detect an outfit of the user,
Analyze a gait of the user using a machine-learning model, the motion data being used as input to the machine-learning model, the analysis being based on the identified outfit of the user, and
Authenticate the user based on the analysis of the gait of the user.
19. A mobile device comprising the apparatus according to claim 18.
20. A system comprising the mobile device according to claim 19 and a transmitter device, the transmitter device being suitable for being attached to a component of an outfit, the transmitter device being configured to transmit a radio-frequency signal to the mobile device, the mobile device being configured to authenticate a user based on the transmitted radio-frequency signal.
