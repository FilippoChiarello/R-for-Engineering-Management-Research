APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING COSMETIC SKIN ATTRIBUTES
</title>

<abstract>
A method of determining a cosmetic skin attribute of a person is provided. The method includes obtaining a color channel image of a person's skin, analyzing the color channel image with a computer using entropy statistics to obtain an entropy value, and then determining a cosmetic skin attribute for the person based on the entropy value.

<claims>
1. A method of determining a cosmetic skin attribute of a person, the method comprising: a) obtaining at least one color channel image comprising at least one portion of skin of the person; b) analyzing the at least one color channel image using entropy statistics to obtain an entropy value; and c) determining the cosmetic skin attribute of the at least one portion of skin of the person based on the entropy value.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one color channel image is an image in a color system selected from the group consisting of L*a*b* color system, RGB color system, HSL/HSV color system, and CMYK color system.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein a Skin Attribute Index is generated as a probability value indicative of a condition of the cosmetic skin attribute of the at least one portion of skin of the person relative to a defined population of people.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the Skin Attribute Index is generated as a function of the entropy value defined by F(Entropy Value), wherein said function is determined by a model established upon a training dataset wherein the training dataset comprises (i) a plurality of color channel images of a the defined population of people, wherein each of the plurality of color channel images comprises facial skin of a person in the defined population of people, wherein the facial skin comprises the cosmetic skin attribute, and (ii) an associated class definition based on the cosmetic skin attribute.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the at least one color channel image is an image in the L*a*b* color system selected from the group consisting of an L-channel image, an a-channel image, a b-channel image and a c-channel image from RGB color system, and combinations thereof; wherein the entropy value is selected from the group consisting of a L-entropy value, an a-entropy value, a b-entropy value, a c-entropy value, and combinations thereof; and wherein the function has the formula: Skin Attribute Index=A+B×(L-entropy value)+C×(a-entropy value)+D×(b-entropy value)+E×(c-entropy), wherein A, B, C, D, and E are constants; wherein at least one of B, C, D, and E is not 0.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the at least one color channel image is an L-channel image; wherein the entropy value is an L-entropy value; wherein C, D, and E each have a value of 0; and wherein the generated Skin Attribute Index is indicative of skin purity, skin tone or skin radiance.
7. The method according to claim 5, wherein the at least one color channel image is an a-channel image, the entropy value is an a-entropy value, and B, D, and E each have a value of 0, and wherein the generated Skin Attribute Index is indicative of skin inflammation.
8. The method according to claim 5, wherein the at least one color channel image is a b-channel image, the entropy value is a b-entropy value, and B, C, and E each have a value of 0, and wherein the generated Skin Attribute Index is indicative of skin pigmentation or skin dullness.
9. The method according to claim 5, wherein the at least one color channel image is a c-channel image, the entropy value is a c-entropy value, and B, C, and D each have a value of 0, and wherein the generated Skin Attribute Index is indicative of skin topography.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the skin topography is selected from the group consisting of pores, fine lines, wrinkles, sagging, skin elasticity, and combinations thereof.
11. The method of claim 3, further comprising generating and displaying an image description corresponding to the generated Skin Attribute Index.
12. The method of claim 3, wherein the model is a regression model or a classification model.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein said regression model is a regression model selected from the group consisting of a linear regression model, a machine learning linear regression model, a machine learning support vector regression model, or a random forest regression model.
14. The method according to claim 1, wherein the cosmetic skin attribute is selected from the group consisting of skin purity, skin age, skin topography, skin tone, skin pigmentation, skin pores, skin inflammation, skin hydration, skin sebum level, acne, moles, skin radiance, skin shine, skin dullness, and skin barrier.
15. The method according to claim 14, wherein the cosmetic skin attribute is a visually imperceivable cosmetic skin attribute, wherein the visually imperceivable cosmetic skin attribute is a cosmetic skin attribute which is not detectable by an unaided eye, or a cosmetic skin attribute detectable visually by a consumer but the consumer does not understand the cosmetic skin attribute.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein prior to analyzing, the at least one color channel image is filtered by using a frequency filter selected from the group consisting of Fourier Transformation Filter, Wavelet Transformation, and Difference of Gaussian (DoG) filter.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the first Gaussian Filter has a standard deviation of 5 to 50 and the second Gaussian filter has a standard deviation of 5 to 100.
18. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one portion of skin of the person is facial skin; wherein the facial skin comprises at least one region of interest (ROI) selected from the group consisting of cheek region, eye region, forehead region, nose region, and combinations thereof, and wherein the image description displays a need for improvement in said at least one ROI or a difference in the cosmetic skin attribute between a first ROI and a second ROI.
19. An apparatus for determining a cosmetic skin attribute of a person, the apparatus comprising: an image obtaining device for obtaining at least one color channel image comprising at least one portion of skin of the person, wherein preferably said imaging obtaining device comprises a non-transitory computer readable storage medium configured to store the obtained at least one color channel image; an image processing device coupled with said imaging obtaining device for analyzing the obtained at least one color channel image using entropy statistics to obtain an entropy value and determining the cosmetic skin attribute of the at least one portion of skin of the person based on the entropy value, wherein said image processing device preferably comprises a processor with computer-executable instructions; a display generating unit for generating a display to display content data describing the determined cosmetic skin attribute.
20. A graphical user interface for determining a cosmetic skin attribute of a person, the graphical user interface being on a portable electronic apparatus including a touch screen display/display with an input device and an image obtaining device for obtaining at least one color channel image comprising at least one portion of skin of the person; wherein the graphical user interface comprises: a first area of the display displaying content data describing a cosmetic skin attribute of the at least one portion of skin of the person; and a second area of the display different from the first area, the second area displaying a selectable icon for receiving a user input; and a network interface digitally coupling the apparatus to an entropy analysis unit configured, based on computer executable instructions stored in the entropy analysis unit, to: analyze the at least one color channel image using entropy statistics to obtain an entropy value; and determine the cosmetic skin attribute of the at least one portion of skin of the person based on the entropy value, if the user activates the selectable icon.
