SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR FORWARD MARKET PURCHASE OF MACHINE RESOURCES
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for forward market purchase of machine resources are disclosed. An example transaction-enabling system may include a fleet of machines, each one of the fleet of machines having a resource requirement comprising at least one of a plurality of machine-related resources and a controller. The controller may include an intelligent agent circuit to aggregate data for the plurality of machine-related resources from at least one data source comprising an external data source or an internal data source; an expert system circuit to configure a purchase of at least one of the plurality of machine-related resources; and a machine resource acquisition circuit to automatically solicit the configured purchase of the at least one of the plurality of machine-related resources in a forward market for at least one resource of the plurality of machine-related resources.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A transaction-enabling system, comprising: a fleet of machines, each one of the fleet of machines having a resource requirement comprising at least one of a plurality of machine-related resources; a controller, comprising: an intelligent agent circuit structured to aggregate data for the plurality of machine-related resources from at least one data source comprising an external data source or an internal data source; an expert system circuit structured to configure a purchase of at least one of the plurality of machine-related resources; and a machine resource acquisition circuit structured to automatically solicit the configured purchase of the at least one of the plurality of machine-related resources in a forward market for at least one resource of the plurality of machine-related resources.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the expert system circuit is further configured to identify a timing of the configured purchase, wherein the timing is based at least in part on the aggregated data.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the machine resource acquisition circuit is further structured to automatically solicit the configured purchase in response to the identified timing.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the intelligent agent circuit comprises a system selected from a group consisting of: a simple reflex system, a model-based reflex system, a goal-based system, a utility-based system, a learning system, an embodied system, a fuzzy system, or a data mining system.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one data source comprises the external data source, and wherein the external data source is selected from a list consisting of: a market condition data source, a behavioral data source, an agent data source, and a historical outcome data source.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the expert system circuit is further structured to determine a machine-related resource acquisition value, and to configure the purchase in response to the machine-related resource acquisition value.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the determination of the machine-related resource acquisition value is based in part on a datum selected from the list consisting of: an expected cost range, a cost parameter of a machine resource, an effectiveness parameter of a machine resource, or a future predicted cost of one of the machine related resource.
8. The system of claim 6, wherein the expert system circuit is further structured to determine the machine-related resource acquisition value in response to a comparison of a first cost of the machine-related resource on a spot market of the machine-related resource with a cost parameter of the machine-related resource.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the expert system circuit is further structured to improve a future purchase configuration or timing identification based on a data set comprising outcomes resulting from purchases made under historical input conditions.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one data source comprises the external data source, and wherein the external data source is selected from a list consisting of a bot, a crawler, and a dialog manager.
11. A method, comprising: interpreting a resource requirement for a fleet of machines, wherein each machine of the fleet of machines comprises a requirement of at least one of a plurality of machine-related resources; aggregating data from a data source comprising at least one of an external data source or an internal data source, wherein the aggregated data comprises data related to at least one of the plurality of machine-related resources; operating an intelligent agent to configure a purchase of at least one of the plurality of machine-related resources in response to the resource requirement and the aggregated data; and soliciting the configured purchase of the at least one of the machine-related resources on a forward market for the at least one of the plurality of machine-related resources.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising identifying a timing of the configured purchase.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein soliciting the configured purchase comprises soliciting in response to the identified timing.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein identifying the timing of the configured purchase comprises determining a supply of and a demand for the machine-related resource, based at least in part on the aggregated data.
15. The method of claim 11, further comprising determining a machine-related resource acquisition value, and configuring the purchase further in response to the machine-related resource acquisition value.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein determining the machine-related resource acquisition value comprises comparing a first cost of the machine-related resource on a spot market for the resource with a cost parameter of the machine-related resource.
17. The method of claim 15, further comprising performing a machine-related resource transaction in response to the machine-related resource acquisition value.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein performing the machine-related resource transaction comprises an operation selected from a list of operations consisting of: purchasing the machine-related resource, selling the machine-related resource, making an offer to sell the machine-related resource, and making an offer to purchase the machine-related resource.
19. The method of claim 15, wherein determining the machine-related resource acquisition value is based in part on a datum selected from a list consisting of: an expected cost range, a cost parameter of a machine-related resource, an effectiveness parameter of a machine-related resource, and a future predicted cost of at least one of the plurality of machine-related resources.
20. The method of claim 11, further comprising improving the configuring the purchase based on a data set comprising outcomes resulting from purchases made under historical input conditions.
