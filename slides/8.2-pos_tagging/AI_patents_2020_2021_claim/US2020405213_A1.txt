CONTENT GENERATION AND CONTROL USING SENSOR DATA FOR DETECTION OF NEUROLOGICAL STATE
</title>

<abstract>
Applications for a Content Engagement Power (CEP) value include generating a script, text, or other communication content or for controlling playout of communication content based on neuro-physiological data, gathering neuro-physiological data correlated to consumption of communication content, or rating effectiveness of personal communications. The CEP is computed based on neuro-physiological sensor data processed to express engagement with content along multiple dimensions such as valence, arousal, and dominance. An apparatus is configured to perform the method using hardware, firmware, and/or software.

<claims>
1. A method for generating a script, the method comprising: randomizing, by at least one processor, one or more parameters of a cognitive appraisal model for participants in character interactions; generating a plurality of scripts by the at least one processor at least in part by modeling the character interactions while varying the parameters between different ones of the scripts; for each of the plurality of scripts, estimating a measure of effectiveness compared to one or more targeted story arcs based on a cognitive appraisal model for neuro-physiological response; and recording the measure of effectiveness.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein estimating the measure of effectiveness comprising calculating a Content Engagement Power (CEP) based on the cognitive appraisal model.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein calculating the CEP value further comprises determining arousal values and comparing a stimulation average arousal with an expectation average arousal.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein calculating the CEP value further comprises determining valence values.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein estimating the measure of effectiveness further comprises determining a neurological error measurement based on comparing predicted neuro-physiological responses to a targeted story arc.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the targeted story arc comprises a set of targeted neurological values each uniquely associated with a different interval of a continuous time sequence.
7. An apparatus for generating a script, comprising a processor coupled to a memory, the memory holding program instructions that when executed by the processor cause the apparatus to perform: randomizing one or more parameters of a cognitive appraisal model for participants in character interactions; generating a plurality of scripts at least in part by modeling the character interactions while varying the parameters between different ones of the scripts; for each of the plurality of scripts, estimating a measure of effectiveness based on one of more targeted story arcs based on a cognitive appraisal model for neuro-physiological response; and recording the measure of effectiveness.
8. A method for generating communication content, comprising: receiving, by at least one processor, neuro-physiological data from one or more sensors coupled to at least one user consuming segments of communication content, wherein the segments are selected from a library of alternative segments; calculating, by the at least one processor for each of the segments a measure of the at least one user's neuro-physiological response based on the neuro-physiological data and on a cognitive appraisal model for assessing the neuro-physiological data; and recording, by the at least one processor, the measure of the at least one user's neuro-physiological response for each of the segments in a computer memory associated with an identifier for the each of the segments, for use in at least one of producing communication content including selected ones of the segments or selecting participants for a multi-participant communication session.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising generating communication content, at least in part by selecting segments from the library based on each segment's associated measure of the at least one user's neuro-physiological response, and combining segments selected by the selecting.
10. The method of claim 8, further comprising performing the collecting, the calculating, and the recording for multiple different users each consuming the segments.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising matching users for the multi-participant communication session, at least in part by selecting ones of the multiple different users having complementary measures of neuro-physiological response for corresponding segments.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the multi-participant communication session comprises one or more of a computer game or a social chat session.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein the segments consist essentially of linguistic content.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein the segments consist essentially of audio content.
15. The method of claim 8, wherein the calculating comprises determining a Content Engagement Power (CEP) value for the each of the segments.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein determining the CEP value further comprises determining arousal values based on the neuro-physiological data and comparing a stimulation average arousal based on the neuro-physiological data with an expectation average arousal.
17. The method of claim 15, wherein the neuro-physiological data comprises one or more of electroencephalographic (EEG) data, galvanic skin response (GSR) data, facial electromyography (fEMG) data, electrocardiogram (EKG) data, video facial action unit (FAU) data, brain machine interface (BMI) data, video pulse detection (VPD) data, pupil dilation data, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and functional near-infrared data (fNIR).
18. The method of claim 8, further comprising determining valence values based on the neuro-physiological data.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the neuro-physiological data comprises one or more of electroencephalographic (EEG) data, facial electromyography (fEMG) data, video facial action unit (FAU) data, brain machine interface (BMI) data, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, and functional near-infrared data (fNIR).
20. The method of claim 18, further comprising normalizing the valence values based on corresponding values collected for a set of designated baseline stimuli.
