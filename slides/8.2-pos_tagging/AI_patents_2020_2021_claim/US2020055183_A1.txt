MULTI-OPERATION UNIT INTEGRATION DEVICE, CONTROL METHOD THEREFOR, AND AUTONOMOUS LEARNING TYPE ROBOT DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A multi-operation unit integration device having scale expandability and includes a plurality of operation units each of which includes a movable unit; and an integration module. The integration module includes an operation timing unit that gives operation timings of the plurality of operation units based on an operation instruction input from an outside, and the operation unit includes: a plurality of operation learning units that generate a control signal given to the movable unit according to an operation timing signal from the operation timing unit of the integration module; drive means for driving the movable unit of the operation unit according to the control signal; and a sensor that detects a state quantity of the movable unit driven by the drive means. An autonomous learning type robot device is configured using the multi-operation unit integration device as a control portion.

<claims>
1. 1.-9. (canceled)
10. A multi-operation unit integration device comprising: a plurality of operation units each of which includes a movable unit; and an integration module, wherein the integration module includes an operation timing unit that determines whether a situation where the operation unit is placed is already learned based on sensor information detected by a sensor in the operation unit, and combines operation timings of the plurality of operation units, and the operation unit includes: a plurality of operation learning units that generate a control signal given to the movable unit according to an operation timing signal from the operation timing unit of the integration module; drive means for driving the movable unit of the operation unit according to the control signal; and a sensor that detects a state quantity of the movable unit driven by the drive means.
11. The multi-operation unit integration device according to claim 10, wherein a plurality of the operation timing units in the integration module are selected according to an operation instruction inputted from an outside, and the selected operation timing unit gives the operation timing signal to the operation learning unit in the operation unit, the operation learning unit being fixed by the operation timing unit.
12. The multi-operation unit integration device according to claim 10, wherein the operation timing signal of the integration module fixes an operation content of the operation unit and an operation start or stop timing.
13. The multi-operation unit integration device according to claim 10, wherein the plurality of operation learning units in the operation unit are selected according to the operation timing signal from the operation timing unit, and the selected operation learning unit gives the control signal to the drive means fixed by the operation learning unit.
14. The multi-operation unit integration device according to claim 10, wherein the operation learning unit acquires the control signal for the drive means based on at least one of the operation timing signal and the state quantity.
15. The multi-operation unit integration device according to claim 10, wherein the operation unit includes a storage that stores the operation timing signal in driving the operation unit and the state quantity as learning data, and a parameter of the operation learning unit is adjusted based on the learning data stored in the storage.
16. The multi-operation unit integration device according to claim 10, wherein the integration module adjusts a parameter of the operation timing unit so as to achieve predetermined operation.
17. An autonomous learning type robot device configured using the multi-operation unit integration device according to claim 10 as a control portion.
18. A method for controlling a multi-operation unit integration device including a plurality of operation units each of which includes a movable unit, and an integration module, wherein the integration module inputs an operation instruction for a series of combined operations performed by the plurality of operation units from an outside, gives an operation timing signal to each of the plurality of operation units, decides time when the operation timing signal is given to each of the plurality of operation units, based on presence or absence of learning experience detected by a sensor of each of the plurality of operation units, designates the individual operation unit, and gives the operation timing signal to the designated operation unit, and the designated operation unit drives the movable unit in response to the operation timing signal from the integration module.
