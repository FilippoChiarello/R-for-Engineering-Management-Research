INJECTION MOLDING SYSTEM, MOLDING CONDITION CORRECTION SYSTEM, AND INJECTION MOLDING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An injection molding system includes: determining a manufacturing condition including a first mold and a first injection molding machine; checking whether a first actual production result acquired using the combination of the first mold and the first injection molding machine exists by searching an actual production result storage unit; and generating a correction molding condition for performing injection molding using the combination of the first injection molding machine and first mold based on first molding-machine-unique information acquired in advance for the first injection molding machine, second molding-machine-unique information acquired in advance for a second injection molding machine with which a second actual production result is acquired in combination with the first mold, and the second actual production result acquired from the actual production result storage unit when the first actual production result does not exist, and inputs the generated correction molding condition to the second injection molding machine.
