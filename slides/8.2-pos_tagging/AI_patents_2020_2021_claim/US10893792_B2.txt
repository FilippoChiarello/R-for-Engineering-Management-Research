<title>
Endoscope image processing apparatus and endoscope image processing method
</title>

<abstract>
An endoscope image processing apparatus includes a region-of-interest detection apparatus configured to sequentially receive observation images obtained by performing image pickup of an object and perform processing for detecting a region of interest for each of the observation images, and a processor. The processor calculates an appearance time period as an elapsed time period from a time when the region of interest appears within the observation image when the region-of-interest detection apparatus detects the region of interest, and starts emphasis processing for emphasizing a position of the region of interest existing within the observation image at a timing at which the appearance time period reaches a predetermined time period.

<claims>
1. An endoscope image processing apparatus comprising: a region-of-interest detection apparatus configured to sequentially receive observation images obtained by performing image pickup of an object and to perform processing for detecting a region of interest for each of the observation images; and a processor, the processor being configured to: calculate an appearance time period as an elapsed time period from a first timing at which at least a part of the region of interest appears within the observation image, the first timing differing from a second timing at which the region-of-interest detection apparatus detects the region of interest, and start emphasis processing for emphasizing a position of the region of interest existing within the observation image at a timing at which the appearance time period reaches a predetermined time period, wherein the processor calculates the appearance time period based on a first time period as a time period from a time when the observation image in a first frame as a frame where one region of interest detected by the region-of-interest detection apparatus first appears is inputted to the region-of-interest detection apparatus until the observation image in a second frame as a current frame is inputted to the region-of-interest detection apparatus, and wherein the processor reversely tracks a position of the one region of interest using the observation image in the second frame as a starting point to specify the observation image in the first frame, and calculates the first time period based on a number of frames from the first frame to the second frame.
2. An endoscope image processing apparatus comprising: a region-of-interest detection apparatus configured to sequentially receive observation images obtained by performing image pickup of an object and to perform processing for detecting a region of interest for each of the observation images; and a processor, the processor being configured to: calculate an appearance time period as an elapsed time period from a first timing at which at least a part of the region of interest appears within the observation image, the first timing differing from a second timing at which the region-of-interest detection apparatus detects the region of interest, and start emphasis processing for emphasizing a position of the region of interest existing within the observation image at a timing at which the appearance time period reaches a predetermined time period, wherein the processor calculates the appearance time period based on a second time period as a time period estimated to be required until one region of interest detected by the region-of-interest detection apparatus moves to a current position after entering the observation image, and wherein the processor calculates the second time period based on an estimated movement speed of the one region of interest included in the observation image in a current frame.
3. An endoscope image processing apparatus comprising: a region-of-interest detection apparatus configured to sequentially receive observation images obtained by performing image pickup of an object and to perform processing for detecting a region of interest for each of the observation images; and a processor, the processor being configured to: calculate an appearance time period as an elapsed time period from a first timing at which at least a part of the region of interest appears within the observation image, the first timing differing from a second timing at which the region-of-interest detection apparatus detects the region of interest, and start emphasis processing for emphasizing a position of the region of interest existing within the observation image at a timing at which the appearance time period reaches a predetermined time period, wherein the processor is configured to calculate the appearance time period based on a third time period as a time period obtained by estimating the elapsed time period depending on a situation where the region-of-interest detection apparatus detects one region of interest, and wherein the processor calculates the third time period based on an estimated detection time period as a time period estimated to be required to detect the one region of interest in the region-of-interest detection apparatus and a continued detection time period as an elapsed time period from a time when the region-of-interest detection apparatus starts to detect the one region of interest.
4. The endoscope image processing apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the processor sets the estimated detection time period based on one or more parameters each representing an image pickup state of the one region of interest included in the observation image in a current frame.
