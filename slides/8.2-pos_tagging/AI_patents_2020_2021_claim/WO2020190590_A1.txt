<title>
MONOCYTE-SELECTIVE DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM USING SINGLE-WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES TO INDUCE EFFEROCYTOSIS
</title>

<abstract>
Provided herein are compositions and methods of using single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) to target a specific subset of immune calls bearing an anti-phagocytic signal for selective delivery of a therapeutic agent (e.g a small molecule inhibitor of an anti-phagocytic signal) to inhibit the 'don't-eat-me' signaling pathway and restore efferocytosis. For example, using SWNTs, an inhibitor of SHP1 phosphatase ('SHP1i') acting in the CD47/SIRPa signaling pathway was specifically delivered to Ly-6Chi monocytes that avoid efferocytosis and home to atherosclerotic plaques allowing apoptotic cells to accumulate. The targeted delivery of SHP1i to these monocytes resulted in an increase in efferocytosis and the stabilization and reduction in atherosclerotic plaques. These compositions and methods can be used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases or disorders, such as, for example, atherosclerosis.

<claims>
1 . A composition for delivering a therapeutic agent that increases efferocytosis in a mammalian subject, comprising:
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and a therapeutic agent.
2. The composition of claim 1 , wherein the immune or inflammatory disorder is an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).
3. A composition for targeted delivery of a therapeutic agent that increases efferocytosis in a diseased tissue marked by the presence of Ly-6Chi monocytes, comprising:
SWNTs;
the SWNTs deliver a therapeutic agent that increases efferocytosis for delivery to a diseased tissue marked by the presence of Ly-6Chi monocytes.
4. The composition of claim 1 or claim 3, wherein the therapeutic agent increases efferocytosis of apoptotic cells or cellular degradation products by reversing an anti-phagocytic signal.
5. The composition of claim 1 or claim 3, wherein the therapeutic agent increases efferocytosis of cellular degradation products in atherosclerotic plaques.
6. The composition of claim 1 or claim 3, wherein the therapeutic agent is a small molecule.
7. The composition of claim 6, wherein the small molecule is an inhibitor of a molecule in a CD47/SIRPa signaling pathway.
8. The composition of claim 7, wherein the small molecule inhibits SHP1 phosphatase.
9. The composition of claim 8, wherein the small molecule is the SHP1 inhibitor TPI-1 .
10. The composition of claim 8, wherein the small molecule that inhibits SHP1 is NSC-
87877.
1 1 . A method of treating an immune and/or inflammatory disorder in a subject, the method comprising: administering to the subject an effective dose of the composition of claim 1 or claim 3, and treating the immune and/or inflammatory disorder.
12. The method of claim 1 1 , wherein the immune and/or inflammatory disorder is ASCVD.
13. The method of claim 1 1 or claim 12, wherein the therapeutic agent increases efferocytosis of apoptotic cells or cellular degradation products by reversing an anti-phagocytic signal.
14. The method of claim 1 1 or claim 12, wherein the therapeutic agent increases efferocytosis of cellular degradation products in atherosclerotic plaques.
15. The method of claim 1 1 or claim 12, wherein the therapeutic agent is a small molecule.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the small molecule is an inhibitor of a molecule in a CD47/SIRPa signaling pathway.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the small molecule inhibits SHP1 phosphatase.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the small molecule is the SHP1 inhibitor TPI-1 .
19. The method of claim 17, wherein the small molecule that inhibits SHP1 is NSC-
87877.
20. The method of claim 1 1 or claim 12, wherein the subject has been diagnosed as having at least one 9p21 risk allele for atherosclerosis.
21 . The method of claim 1 1 or claim 12, further comprising the step of genotyping the subject for the presence of at least one 9p21 risk allele.
22. The method of claim 1 1 or claim 12, wherein the 9p21 risk allele is genotyped by determination of the presence of an SNP variant at 9p21 associated with risk.
23. The method of claim 1 1 or claim 12, wherein the subject is a mammal.
24. The method of claim 23, wherein the mammal is a human.
25. A kit for delivery of a therapeutic agent that increases efferocytosis to treat an immune and/or inflammatory disorder in a mammalian subject, comprising:
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) comprising:
a therapeutic agent that increases efferocytosis for delivery to and treatment of an individual having an immune or inflammatory disorder; and
instructions for use.
26. Use of the composition of claim 1 or claim 3 in the manufacture of a medicament to stabilize, prevent or reduce atherosclerotic plaques, wherein the medicament is used to treat an immune and/or inflammatory disorder in a mammalian subject.
