<title>
DYNAMICALLY EXPOSING REPETITIVELY USED DATA IN A USER INTERFACE
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for enhancing user interaction with an interface are described. In one aspect, a method includes displaying a keyboard layer of a user interface that includes a keyboard having at least one user interface element configured to receive a user input. An initial input at a given user interface element is detected. In response to detecting the initial interaction, a first portion of a symbol layer of the user interface is revealed while maintaining display of the keyboard layer of the user interface. A subsequent input at the given user interface element is detected. In response to detecting the subsequent input, a larger portion of the symbol layer of the user interface is revealed while maintaining a position of the first portion of the symbol layer that was previously revealed in response to detecting the initial input.

<claims>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method, comprising:
displaying, in a user interface, a keyboard layer of a user interface that includes a keyboard having at least one user interface element configured to receive a user input;
detecting an initial input at a given user interface element;
revealing, in response to detecting the initial interaction, a first portion of a symbol layer of the user interface while maintaining display of the keyboard layer of the user interface, the symbol layer having at least one user interface element configured to receive a user input indicative of a symbol;
detecting a subsequent input at the given user interface element;
revealing, in response to detecting the subsequent input, a larger portion of the symbol layer of the user interface while maintaining a position of the first portion of the symbol layer that was previously revealed in response to detecting the initial input, wherein revealing the larger portion of the symbol layer occludes at least a portion of the keyboard layer.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein revealing a first portion of a symbol layer comprises revealing at least one row of user interface elements, each user interface element in the row being configured to receive a user input indicative of a frequently used symbol, and wherein the row is displayed at a location above the keyboard.
3. The method of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein revealing a first portion of a symbol layer comprises revealing at least one row of user interface elements, each user interface element in the row being configured to receive a user input indicative of an emoji, a Hanzi character, a shape, or a web design widget.
4. The method of any of the preceding claims, further comprising selecting a set of symbols that are included in the first portion of the symbol layer based on a frequency of use of symbols that are included in the larger portion of the symbol layer. 5. The method of claim 4, wherein selecting the set of symbols comprises:
identifying a particular symbol having a highest frequency of use;
including a user interface element configured to receive a user input indicative of the particular symbol at a first position of the first portion of the symbol layer;
identifying a set of additional symbols each having a frequency of use that is lower than the particular symbol, but higher than remaining symbols in the symbol layer; and
including a plurality of user interface elements each configured to receive a user input indicative of a respective one of the set of additional symbols in other positions of the first portion of the symbol layer.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising:
prior to receiving a user input at the symbol layer, initially populating the first portion of the symbol layer with a default set of symbols;
in response to an initial set of user inputs at the symbol layer, updating the first portion of the symbol layer to include a user interface element configured to receive the user input indicative of the particular symbol having the highest frequency of use at the first position of the first portion of the symbol layer while the first portion of the symbol layer remains displayed.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising determining the default set of symbols based on one or more of a machine learning model that provides a set of recommended symbols, contextual information about a current user session, or based on a set of userspecified preferences.
8. The method of claim 4, wherein identifying the particular symbol having the highest frequency of use is performed based on frequency of use data collected from a different application than a particular application that causes the first portion of the symbol layer to be displayed.
9. A computer program having instructions that, when executed by one or more data processing apparatus, cause the data processing apparatus to perform the method of any of claims 1 to 8. 10. A computer readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by one or more data processing apparatus, cause the data processing apparatus to perform the method of any of claims 1 to 8.
11. A system, comprising:
a data storage device; and
one or more processors configured to interact with the data storage device and perform the method of any of claims 1 to 8.
