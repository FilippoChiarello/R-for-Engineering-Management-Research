SENSOR ARRANGEMENT MODE ACQUISITION DEVICE AND SENSOR ARRANGEMENT MODE ACQUISITION METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A sensor arrangement mode acquisition device capable of acquiring an arrangement mode of sensors while evaluating a detection accuracy of a predetermined action and a limitation on the number of sensors is provided. An E2PROM (13) of a sensor arrangement mode acquisition device (1) stores a database that defines a relationship between k×m correct answer ratios when the number of sensors (2) within a range of n or less is disposed in a test subject in k different arrangement modes, the k arrangement modes, and m predetermined actions. A controller (10) acquires one or more arrangement modes from the database in a case where an upper limit number of sensors, a predetermined action, and attachment areas of the sensors are selected by operating an input device (12) and a result display button (27) is pressed, and displays the acquired arrangement modes on a display (11).
