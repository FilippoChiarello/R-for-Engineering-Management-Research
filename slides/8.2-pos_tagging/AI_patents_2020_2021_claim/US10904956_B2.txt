<title>
Beverage package with induction heater
</title>

<abstract>
A system for heating a consumable product includes a package and a heating apparatus. The package includes a container body including a cavity at least partially bounded by a side wall and one or more inductively heatable elements disposed within the cavity. The side wall includes a non-inductively heatable portion. The cavity is configured to contain the consumable product. The heating apparatus includes: a housing, which defines a package-receiving cavity configured to position the package in an operative position; one or more induction coils disposed within the housing, a controller; and one or more temperature sensing devices disposed in proximity to the non-inductively heatable portion of the side wall when the package is in the operative position. The controller is configured to control one or more operating parameters of the heating apparatus based at least partially on one or more signals received from the one or more temperature sensing devices.

<claims>
1. An induction heating system comprising: a housing including a cavity; an induction coil positioned in the housing adjacent to the cavity; a container for a consumable substance, at least a portion of the container being susceptible to induction heating by the induction coil, the container having an upper portion and a lower portion; a generally cylindrical cradle extending within the cavity and configured to receive the lower portion of the container; a motor coupled to the housing and operative to rotate the cradle relative to the housing; and the container and the housing being collectively configured such that the container assumes an operative position relative to the housing when the container is received within the cavity and is supported within the housing, the lower portion being located within the cavity adjacent to the induction coil and the upper portion extending outside of the housing when the container assumes the operative position.
2. The induction heating system recited in claim 1, further including at least one thermometer coupled to the housing and configured to measure a temperature of at least a point on the upper portion container.
3. The induction heating system recited in claim 1, wherein the container further includes indicia on an upper portion thereof, the induction heating system further comprising at least one optical reader coupled to the housing and configured to read the indicia when the container assumes the operative position.
4. The induction heating system recited in claim 1, wherein the cradle is removably coupled to the housing.
5. The induction heating system recited in claim 1, wherein the motor is coupled to the cradle via a gear.
6. The induction heating system recited in claim 5, wherein the cradle is removably coupled to the housing.
7. The induction heating system recited in claim 1, wherein the cradle is engageable to the container via complementary surfaces on the cradle and the container.
8. The induction heating system recited in claim 7, wherein the motor is linked to the cradle via a gear.
9. The induction heating system recited in claim 1, wherein the cradle includes a lip which extends out of the housing.
10. An induction heating system comprising: a housing; an induction coil in the housing; a container for a consumable substance, at least a portion of the container being susceptible to inducting heating by the induction coil; a cradle coupled to the housing and capable of receiving at least a portion of the container; a motor in operative communication with the cradle to rotate the cradle; and at least one thermometer coupled to the housing and configured to measure a temperature of a portion of the container when the container is received in the cradle.
11. The induction heating system of claim 10, further comprising insulation extending over a portion of the container to define a covered segment as that segment of the container covered by the insulation and a non-covered segment as that segment of the container not covered by the insulation, the container, the insulation, and the at least one thermometer being configured such that when the container is in a first operative position, the at least one thermometer is positioned to measure the temperature of the non-insulated portion.
12. The induction heating system of claim 11, wherein when the container is in a second operative position, the at least one thermometer is positioned to measure the temperature of the insulated portion, the motor being operative to rotate the container between the first operative position and the second operative position.
13. The induction heating system of claim 10, wherein the motor is coupled to the cradle via a gear.
14. The induction heating system of claim 10, wherein the cradle is removable.
15. The induction heating system of claim 10, wherein the cradle is engageable with the container via complementary surfaces on the cradle and the container.
16. The induction heating system of claim 15, wherein the motor is coupled to the cradle via a gear.
17. An induction heating device for use with a container for a consumable substance, at least a portion of the container being susceptible to induction heating, the induction heating device comprising: a housing; an induction coil in the housing and capable heating the portion of the container susceptible to induction heating; a cradle coupled to the housing and capable of receiving at least a portion of the container; a motor in operative communication with the cradle to rotate the cradle; and at least one thermometer coupled to the housing and configured to measure a temperature of a portion of the container when the container is received in the cradle.
18. The induction heating device of claim 17, wherein the motor is coupled to the cradle via a gear.
