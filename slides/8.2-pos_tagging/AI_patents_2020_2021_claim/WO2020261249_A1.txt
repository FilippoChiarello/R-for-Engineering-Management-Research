<title>
ORTHOPAEDIC PRE-OPERATIVE PLANNING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A method for determining one or more of selection, positioning or placement of a surgical implant, the method inludes: predicting function of an impaired anatomical structure in an unimpaired condition; predicting post-operative function of the structure for one or more implants; selecting one or more of the implant, the implant position, or the implant location to improve the predicted post-operative function.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for determining one or more of selection, positioning or placement of a surgical implant, the method including the steps of:
predicting function of an impaired anatomical structure in an unimpaired condition;
predicting post-operative function of the structure for one or more implants;
selecting one or more of the implant, the implant position or the implant location to improve the predicted post-operative function. 2. The method of claim 1 further comprising minimising one or more differences between the predicted post-operative function and the predicted unimpaired function.
3. The method of any one of claims 1 or 2 wherein pre-operative data for the impaired structure is obtained.
4. The method any one of the preceding claims wherein data for the subject or patient may also be obtained, as may data for a population of subjects.
5. The method of any one of the preceding claims wherein post-operative data may be obtained to improve the predictive functions.
6. The method of any one of the preceding claims including producing a patient anatomical model. Preferably the model comprises a 3D model. 7. The method of any one of the preceding claims wherein the model is generated from one or more patient medical images.
8. The method of claim 7 wherein one or more patient medical images is processed and a statistical shape model is used to produce the patient anatomical model.
9. The method of any one of the preceding claims wherein the method may include a machine learning method, such as an artifical neural network or a deep neural network for performing one or more method steps, for example classifying and/or filtering patient anatomical or medical images.
10. A method for determining one or more of selection, positioning or placement of a surgical implant, the method including the steps of:
obtaining pre-operative data for a patient having an impaired anatomical structure;
predicting post-operative function of the anatomical structure for one or more implants; selecting one or more of the implant, the implant position or the implant location to improve the predicted post-operative function of the structure.
11. The method of claim 10 applied to determine one or more of: the type of implant; the shape of the implant; the fixing points for the implant.
12. The method of claim 10 or claim 11 including producing a patient anatomical model. .
13. The method of claim 12 wherein the model is generated from one or more patient medical images.
14. The method of claim 12 or claim 13 wherein one or more patient medical images is processed and a statistical shape model is used to produce the patient anatomical model.
15. The method of any one of claims 10 to 14 comprising a machine learning method, comprising an artifical neural network or a deep neural network for performing one or more method steps.
16. The method of claim 15 comprising classifying and/or filtering patient anatomical or medical images using the machine learning method.
16. The method of any one of claims 14 to 16 wherein the statistical shape model is used to identify or produce one or more of: an anatomical landmark, feature or region; one or more geometric models; one or more morphometric measurements.
17. The method of claim 16 wherein the anatomical landmark(s), feature(s) or region(s) may be a surgically relevant landmark, feature or region.
18. The method of claim 17 wherein the surgically relevant landmark of feature may comprise a fixation point, or region or location for an implant.
19. Any novel feature or combination of features disclosed herein.
