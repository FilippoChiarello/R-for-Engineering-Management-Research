SOFT CAPACITIVE PRESSURE SENSORS
</title>

<abstract>
Soft capacitive pressure sensors for continuous wearable health monitoring applications are described herein. Wrinkled gold thin films on elastomeric substrates are used as robust parallel plate electrodes to create a robust integration with the polymer, allowing repeated normal force to deform the thin film without failure. By incorporating micro-ridged structures that support the counter electrodes to create air cavities within the elastomeric dielectric layer, pressure sensitivity is further increased. The pressure sensors are configured to measure human physiological signals such as pressure exerted from a radial pulse on a skin's surface. The radial pulse pressure detected by the sensor can be correlated to an arterial blood pressure. Calibration of said pressure sensors using a neural network allows for determination of absolute blood pressure.
