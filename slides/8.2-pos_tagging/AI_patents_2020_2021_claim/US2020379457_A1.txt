<title>
Exception Situation Playback for Tele-operators
</title>

<abstract>
Resolving an exception situation in autonomous driving includes receiving an assistance request to resolve the exception situation from an autonomous vehicle (AV); identifying a solution to the exception situation; forwarding the solution to a tele-operator; receiving a request for playback data from the tele-operator; receiving, from the AV, the playback data; and obtaining, from the tele-operator, a validated solution based on the tele-operator using the playback data. The playback data includes snapshots ni of data related to autonomous driving stored at the AV at respective consecutive times ti, for i=1, . . . , N.

<claims>
1. A method for resolving an exception situation in autonomous driving, comprising: receiving an assistance request to resolve the exception situation from an autonomous vehicle (AV); identifying a solution to the exception situation; forwarding the solution to a tele-operator; receiving a request for playback data from the tele-operator; receiving, from the AV, the playback data, wherein the playback data comprising snapshots ni of data related to autonomous driving stored at the AV at respective consecutive times ti, wherein i=1, . . . , N; and obtaining, from the tele-operator, a validated solution based on the tele-operator using the playback data.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein obtaining, from the tele-operator, the validated solution based on the tele-operator using the playback data comprising: displaying sequentially, to the tele-operator, images from a front facing camera of the AV.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein obtaining, from the tele-operator, the validated solution based on the tele-operator using the playback data comprising: receiving, from the tele-operator, a perspective-shift command including a perspective; and displaying sequentially, to the tele-operator, images from the perspective.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving, from the tele-operator, an annotation of the playback data.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: transmitting the validated solution to the AV.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: highlighting, in a playback of the playback data, real world objects causing the exception situation.
7. A method for recording exception situations by an autonomous vehicle (AV), comprising: storing, in a memory, at consecutive times t, respective snapshots ni of data related to autonomous driving, wherein i=1, . . . , N; identifying an exception situation occurring at time tn+1; in response to determining that tele-operator assistance is not required, replacing a first snapshot ni with a new snapshot corresponding to the time tn+1; and in response to determining that tele-operator assistance is required: freezing the snapshots ni, for i=1, . . . , N; and transmitting the snapshots ni to an autonomous system.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein transmitting the snapshots ni to the autonomous system comprising: transmitting the snapshots ni to the autonomous system in response to receiving a request from the autonomous system for the snapshots ni.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the memory is a circular buffer.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein a first snapshot n1 is stored at a location L of the circular buffer, and wherein replacing the first snapshot n1 with the new snapshot corresponding to the time tN+1 comprising: replacing the first snapshot n1 at the location L with the new snapshot.
11. The method of claim 7, wherein the data related to autonomous driving comprises raw sensor data.
12. The method of claim 7, wherein the data related to autonomous driving comprises processed data of raw sensor data.
13. The method of claim 7, wherein freezing the snapshots ni, for i=1, . . . , N further comprising: storing the new snapshot corresponding to the time tn+1 in another memory that is different than the memory.
14. A system for resolving an exception situation in autonomous driving, comprising: a memory; and a processor, the memory includes instructions executable by the processor to: receive an assistance request to resolve the exception situation from an autonomous vehicle (AV); receive a request for playback data from the tele-operator; receive from the AV the playback data, wherein the playback data comprising snapshots ni of data related to autonomous driving stored at the AV at respective consecutive times ti, wherein i=1, . . . , N; and obtain, from the tele-operator, a validated solution based on the tele-operator using the playback data.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the instructions to obtain, from the tele-operator, the validated solution based on the tele-operator using the playback data comprises instructions to: display sequentially, to the tele-operator, images from a front facing camera of the AV.
16. The system of claim 14, wherein the instructions to obtain, from the tele-operator, the validated solution based on the tele-operator using the playback data comprises instructions to: receive, from the tele-operator, a perspective-shift command including a perspective; and display sequentially, to the tele-operator, images from the perspective.
17. The system of claim 14, wherein the instructions further comprise instructions to: receive, from the tele-operator, an annotation of the playback data.
18. The system of claim 14, wherein the instructions further comprise instructions to: transmit the validated solution to the AV.
19. The system of claim 14, wherein the instructions further comprise instructions to: highlight, in a playback of the playback data, real world objects causing the exception situation.
20. The system of claim 14, wherein the instructions further comprise instructions to: receiving, from the tele-operator, an annotation of the playback data, subsequent to transmitting the validated solution to the AV.
