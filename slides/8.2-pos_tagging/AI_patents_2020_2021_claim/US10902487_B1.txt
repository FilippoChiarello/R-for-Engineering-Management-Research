<title>
Multiple data store authentication
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for authenticating access to multiple data stores substantially in real-time are disclosed. The system may include a server coupled to a network, a client device in communication with the server via the network and a plurality of data stores. The server may authenticate access to the data stores and forward information from those stores to the client device. An exemplary authentication method may include receipt of a request for access to data. Information concerning access to that data is stored and associated with an identifier assigned to a client device. If the identifier is found to correspond to the stored information during a future request for access to the store, access to that store is granted.

<claims>
1. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, the non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions to be implemented on at least one server including at least one processor, the instructions when executed by the at least one processor cause the at least one server to perform a method for providing access to one or more data stores that are communicatively coupled to the at least one server over a network, the method comprising: sending a first identifier for a client device upon the client device communicating with the server for the client device to present the first identifier in a subsequent connection with the server; receiving registration information for a data store from the client device, wherein a second identifier is generated and associated with the data store and the registration information, wherein the second identifier is send to the client device; receiving, via the subsequent connection with the client device, a request for the client device to receive information from the data store, wherein the subsequent connection includes the first identifier; configuring a service to receive data from the data store on behalf of the client device, wherein the service is based on the second identifier; receiving a first message indicative of new information at the data store; transmitting a second message to the client device in response to receipt of the first message; wherein additional information associated with the first message is sent from the data store to the client device upon receipt of the second message by the client device.
2. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 1, wherein the one or more data stores is associated with an electronic mail service provider.
3. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 1, wherein the client device is one of a cellular telephone, personal digital assistant, or personal computer.
4. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 1, wherein the first identifier is a token, the token comprising a unique string of data.
5. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 1, wherein a third identifier is generated for another data store.
6. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 1, wherein the first identifier is specific to the client device.
7. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 1, wherein the first message is limited in data size.
8. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 1, wherein the first message is received when the first message matches a predefined characteristic set by the data store.
9. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 1, wherein the data store is communicatively coupled to the client device and can transmit to the client device using a connection that is independent of the server.
10. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 1, wherein the instructions further cause the at least one server to direct the client device to delete content thereon in response to an indication that the client device is misappropriated.
11. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 1, wherein the additional information is sent over a subsequently established connection that is independent of the server.
12. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 1, wherein the first identifier is generated by the server.
13. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 1, wherein an IP connection is established between the client device and the data store in response to transmission of the second message to the client device by the server for sending of the additional information.
