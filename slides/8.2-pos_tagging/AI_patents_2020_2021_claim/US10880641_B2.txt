Methods, systems, and media for ambient background noise modification based on mood and/or behavior information
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and media for ambient background noise modification are provided. In some implementations, the method comprises: identifying at least one noise present in an environment of a user having a user device, an activity the user is currently engaged in, and a physical or emotional state of the user; determining a target ambient noise to be produced in the environment based at least in part on the identified noise, the activity the user is currently engaged in, and the physical or emotional state of the user; identifying at least one device associated with the user device to be used to produce the target ambient noise; determining sound outputs corresponding to each of the one or more identified devices, wherein a combination of the sound outputs produces an approximation of one or more characteristics of the target ambient noise; and causing the one or more identified devices to produce the determined sound outputs.

<claims>
1. A method for noise modification, the method comprising: determining a physical or emotional state of a user having a user device; determining a target activity for a user based on a current time of day and the physical or emotional state of the user; determining a target ambient noise to be produced in proximity of the user based at least in part on the physical or emotional state of the user and the target activity for the user; identifying at least one device associated with the user device to be used to produce the target ambient noise; causing a sound output to be produced by the identified at least one device that produces an approximation of the target ambient noise; determining an update to the physical state of the user; determining an update to the target ambient noise based on the update to the physical state of the user; and causing the sound output produced by the identified at least one device to be changed based on the update to the target ambient noise.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the target ambient noise is based on a current weather condition.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the physical state of the user is determined based on biometric data.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the biometric data is a heart rate of the user.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the biometric data is received from a wearable computer associated with the user device.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein causing the sound output to be produced by the identified at least one device comprises: identifying an audio file corresponding to the target ambient noise; and causing the identified audio file to be presented by the identified at least one device.
7. A system for noise modification, the system comprising: a hardware processor that is programmed to: determine a physical or emotional state of a user having a user device; determine a target activity for a user based on a current time of day and the physical or emotional state of the user; determine a target ambient noise to be produced in proximity of the user based at least in part on the physical or emotional state of the user and the target activity for the user; identify at least one device associated with the user device to be used to produce the target ambient noise; cause a sound output to be produced by the identified at least one device that produces an approximation of the target ambient noise; determine an update to the physical state of the user; determine an update to the target ambient noise based on the update to the physical state of the user; and cause the sound output produced by the identified at least one device to be changed based on the update to the target ambient noise.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein determining the target ambient noise is based on a current weather condition.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein the physical state of the user is determined based on biometric data.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the biometric data is a heart rate of the user.
11. The system of claim 9, wherein the biometric data is received from a wearable computer associated with the user device.
12. The system of claim 7, wherein causing the sound output to be produced by the identified at least one device comprises: identifying an audio file corresponding to the target ambient noise; and causing the identified audio file to be presented by the identified at least one device.
13. A non-transitory computer-readable medium containing computer executable instructions, that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform a method for noise modification, the method comprising: determining a physical or emotional state of a user having a user device; determining a target activity for a user based on a current time of day and the physical or emotional state of the user; determining a target ambient noise to be produced in proximity of the user based at least in part on the physical or emotional state of the user and the target activity for the user; identifying at least one device associated with the user device to be used to produce the target ambient noise; causing a sound output to be produced by the identified at least one device that produces an approximation of the target ambient noise; determining an update to the physical state of the user; determining an update to the target ambient noise based on the update to the physical state of the user; and causing the sound output produced by the identified at least one device to be changed based on the update to the target ambient noise.
14. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 13, wherein determining the target ambient noise is based on a current weather condition.
15. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 13, wherein the physical state of the user is determined based on biometric data.
16. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the biometric data is a heart rate of the user.
17. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the biometric data is received from a wearable computer associated with the user device.
18. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 13, wherein causing the sound output to be produced by the identified at least one device comprises: identifying an audio file corresponding to the target ambient noise; and causing the identified audio file to be presented by the identified at least one device.
