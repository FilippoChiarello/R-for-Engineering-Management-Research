<title>
SYSTEM AND METHOD IMPLEMENTING A SEARCH AND DISCOVERY LOOP TO HELP USERS QUICKLY NAVIGATE THROUGH STRUCTURED AND UNSTRUCTURED INFORMATION
</title>

<abstract>
A system for searching and discovering information where a first server is provided with a digital catalogue of products and is connected to a communication network. The first server communicates with a front-end client associated to an user and connected to said communication network, and with a back-end server connected to said communication network. The back-end server has in turn an indexing section for processing the data of said digital catalogue in order to extract and save relevant data of said digital catalogue in an index, and a runtime section adapted to interpret the user query on the front-end client, compare the search information and/or the user behavior with said index and send to said front-end client suggestions to the user on how to refine said query.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system for searching and discovering information comprising: a first server comprising a digital catalogue of items and connected to a communication network; a front-end client associated to an user and connected to said communication network; a back-end server connected to said communication network, said back-end server comprising in turn an indexing section adapted to process the data of said digital catalogue in order to extract and save relevant data of said digital catalogue in an index; and a runtime section adapted to interpret the user query on said front-end client, compare the search information and/or the user behavior with said index and send to said front-end client suggestions to the user on how to refine said query.
2. The system according to claim 1, wherein said indexing section is further adapted to: clean and normalize the data of said digital catalogue; detect the data type of said data; assess the relevant fields of said data; extract objects and properties from the relevant fields of the data of said digital catalogue and storing of said objects and properties in a database; build an index with the data type, objects and properties of said data.
3. The system according to claim 2, wherein said runtime section is further adapted to: clean and normalize the query of the user; extract objects and properties from the relevant fields of said query; retrieve all the items in said index built with the data source that match the query by the user; determine the most appropriate feature to promote discovery in said digital catalog based on relevant fields of the data of said digital catalogue and on the items in said index built with the data source that match the query by the user; produce a response to the query of the user, said response containing a list of results and a list of discovery features; send said response to said front-end client.
4. The system according to claim 1, wherein said communication network is the Internet network.
5. The system according to claim 4, wherein the communication between said front-end client and said back-end server is made through a set of APIs.
6. A method for providing search and discovery information from a digital catalogue of items on a first server connected to a communication network to a user associated with a front-end client connected to said communication network, said user making a query regarding items of said digital catalogue, comprising: (i) reading and processing the data of said digital catalogue by a back-end server connected to said communication network in order to extract and save relevant data of said digital catalogue in an index; (ii) interpret, by said back-end server, the user query, compare the search information and/or the user behavior with said index and send to said front-end client suggestions to the user on how to refine said query.
7. The method according to claim 6, wherein the step (i) comprise the steps of: cleaning and normalizing the data of said digital catalogue; detecting the data type of said data; assessing the relevant fields of said data; extracting objects and properties from the relevant fields of the data of said digital catalogue and storing of said objects and properties in a database; building an index with the data type, objects and properties of said data.
8. The method according to claim 7, wherein the step (ii) comprise the steps of: cleaning and normalizing the query of the user; extracting objects and properties from the relevant fields of said query; retrieving all the items in said index built with the data source that match the query by the user; determining the most appropriate feature to promote discovery in said digital catalog based on relevant fields of the data of said digital catalogue and on the items in said index built with the data source that match the query by the user; producing a response to the query of the user, said response containing a list of results and a list of discovery features; sending said response to said front-end client.
