SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ASSESSING AND MONITORING THE HEMODYNAMIC CONDITION OF A PATIENT
</title>

<abstract>
A system for assessing and monitoring the hemodynamic condition of a patient includes a signal processor and optionally a premise processing system. Additionally, the system can include a biosignal detection device, memory, a display, and any other suitable component. A method for assessing and monitoring the hemodynamic condition of a patient includes: receiving input data; determining a set of windows based on the input data; preprocessing each of the set of windows; processing each of the set of windows; determining a set of features for each of the set of windows; determining a hemodynamic condition for each window based on the set of features; and presenting the hemodynamic condition to a user.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for the continuous monitoring of a physiological condition of a patient, the method comprising: receiving a physiological signal stream; determining a set of labels associated with the physiological signal stream, comprising: when a portion of the physiological signal stream is missing from the physiological signal stream, assigning a first label to the physiological signal stream; when no portion of the physiological signal stream is missing from the physiological signal stream, determining a set of waveform features based on the physiological signal stream; checking the physiological signal stream for a set of criteria; when at least one of the set of criteria is satisfied, assigning a second label to the physiological signal stream; when none of the set of criteria is satisfied: determining a set of physiological stability values based on the set of waveform features; and assigning one of a third and fourth label to the physiological signal stream based on the set of physiological stability values; and displaying a visual graphic based on the set of labels for a display of a healthcare facility.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining a set of windows based on the physiological signal stream, wherein each of the set of labels is assigned to a window of the set of windows.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein determining the label further comprises resampling the window and removing a baseline drift.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein displaying the visual graphic comprises displaying a set of bars, wherein the set of bars are arranged in a temporal order.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein each of the set of bars is assigned a color depending on a corresponding label of the set of labels.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the set of waveform features comprises a set of peaks.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the set of peaks comprises a set of consolidated peaks.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining a waveform morphology metric based on the set of waveform features, wherein the set of physiological stability values is determined based on the waveform morphology metric.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising determining a heart rate metric based on the set of waveform features, wherein the set of physiological stability values is further determined based on the heart rate metric.
10. A method for the continuous monitoring of a physiological condition of a patient, the method comprising: receiving a physiological signal stream; determining a set of labels for the physiological condition, wherein determining the set of labels comprises: determining a set of waveform features of the physiological signal stream; determining a set of metrics based on the set of waveform features; determining a set of physiological stability values based on the set of metrics; and determining the set of labels, indicating the physiological condition of the patient, based on the set of physiological stability values; and displaying a visual graphic based on the set of labels at a display.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising checking the physiological signal stream for a first and second set of data criteria, wherein: when any of the first set of data criteria are satisfied, a corresponding label of the set of labels indicates that data is missing from the physiological signal stream; and when any of the second set of data criteria are satisfied, a corresponding label for the set of labels indicates that the signal stream is noisy.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein the physiological signal stream comprises an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal stream.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein displaying the visual graphic comprises displaying a time series bar chart comprising a set of bars, wherein each of the set of bars corresponds to a label of the set of labels.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein displaying the visual graphic comprises displaying the visual graphic at a central nursing station of a healthcare facility associated with the patient.
15. The method of claim 10, wherein the set of waveform features comprises a set of peaks.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the set of peaks comprises a set of consolidated peaks.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein determining the set of consolidated peaks comprises applying a set of multiple peak detection processes.
18. The method of claim 10, further comprising determining a set of windows based on the physiological signal stream, wherein each of the set of labels is assigned to a window of the set of windows.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein determining the label further comprises resampling the window and removing a baseline drift.
20. The method of claim 10, wherein the set of metrics comprises a heart rate metric.
21. The method of claim 10, wherein the set of metrics further comprises a waveform morphology metric.
