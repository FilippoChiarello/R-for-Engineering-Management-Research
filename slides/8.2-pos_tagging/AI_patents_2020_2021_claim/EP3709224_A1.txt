INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD AND TERMINAL DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are an information processing method and a terminal device. The method comprises: acquiring first information, wherein the first information is information to be processed by a terminal device; calling an operation instruction in a calculation apparatus to calculate the first information so as to obtain second information; and outputting the second information. By means of the embodiments in the present disclosure, a calculation apparatus of a terminal device can be used to call an operation instruction to process first information, so as to output second information of a target desired by a user, thereby improving the information processing efficiency.
