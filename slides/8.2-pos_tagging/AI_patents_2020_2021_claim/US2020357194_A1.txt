PROVIDING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE MAINTENANCE
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for providing autonomous vehicle assistance are disclosed. In one embodiment, a method is disclosed comprising detecting a service condition in response to a fault occurring at an autonomous vehicle at a first location; coordinating service with a nearby service provider, the service provider providing a time window and a second location; predicting that the autonomous vehicle will be free to fulfill the service; driving the autonomous vehicle to the second location of the service provider during the time window; and returning the autonomous vehicle to the first location after the service is completed.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: detecting, by a computing device, a service condition of autonomous vehicle; identifying, by the computing device, a time window for servicing the autonomous vehicle, the time window generated using a predictive model trained based on operation of the autonomous vehicle; instructing, by the computing device, the autonomous vehicle to navigate to a service provider during the time window.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising training the predictive model based on historical operating data of the autonomous vehicle.
3. The method of claim 2, the training comprising: receiving an availability time series; training the predictive model using the availability time series.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the availability time series comprises a series of measurements of when the autonomous vehicle is not in use.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein each measurement in the series of measurements comprises a time and a flag indicating availability.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the predictive model comprises a recurrent artificial neural network (RANN) with long short-term memory (LSTM).
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving at least one new measurement of when the autonomous vehicle is not in use and re-training the predictive model using the new measurement.
8. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium for tangibly storing computer program instructions capable of being executed by a computer processor, the computer program instructions defining the steps of: detecting a service condition of autonomous vehicle; identifying a time window for servicing the autonomous vehicle, the time window generated using a predictive model trained based on operation of the autonomous vehicle; instructing the autonomous vehicle to navigate to a service provider during the time window.
9. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 8, the computer program instructions further defining the step of training the predictive model based on historical operating data of the autonomous vehicle.
10. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 9, the training comprising: receiving an availability time series; training the predictive model using the availability time series.
11. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 10, wherein the availability time series comprises a series of measurements of when the autonomous vehicle is not in use.
12. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 11, wherein each measurement in the series of measurements comprises a time and a flag indicating availability.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the predictive model comprises a recurrent artificial neural network (RANN) with long short-term memory (LSTM).
14. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 8, the computer program instructions further defining the step of receiving at least one new measurement of when the autonomous vehicle is not in use and re-training the predictive model using the new measurement.
15. A device comprising: a processor; and a storage medium for tangibly storing thereon program logic for execution by the processor, the stored program logic comprising: logic, executed by the processor, for detecting a service condition of autonomous vehicle; logic, executed by the processor, for identifying a time window for servicing the autonomous vehicle, the time window generated using a predictive model trained based on operation of the autonomous vehicle; logic, executed by the processor, for instructing the autonomous vehicle to navigate to a service provider during the time window.
16. The device of claim 15, the stored program logic further comprising logic, executed by the processor, for training the predictive model based on historical operating data of the autonomous vehicle.
17. The device of claim 16, the training comprising: receiving an availability time series; training the predictive model using the availability time series.
18. The device of claim 17, wherein the availability time series comprises a series of measurements of when the autonomous vehicle is not in use.
19. The device of claim 18, wherein each measurement in the series of measurements comprises a time and a flag indicating availability.
20. The device of claim 15, wherein the predictive model comprises a recurrent artificial neural network (RANN) with long short-term memory (LSTM).
