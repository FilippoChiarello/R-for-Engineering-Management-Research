An improved method of operating a field device (1) for measuring and/or monitoring at least one measurement variable (p) and of predictive monitoring of a compliancy of at least one characteristic of said field device (1) to a requirement specified for said field device (1) is described, comprising the steps of: continuously monitoring said characteristic by: at consecutive times (ti) determining and recording a deviation (D(ti)) between a measured value (M(ti)) of a monitored variable (m) determined by said field device (1) and a reference value (R(ti)) of said monitored variable (m), wherein said deviations (D(ti)) are indicative of a degree of compliancy to said requirement, applying a filter to the recorded deviations (D(ti)),based on the deviations (D(ti)) and the filtered deviations (FD(ti)) determining a noise (N) superimposed on the filtered deviations (D(ti)), at the end of at least one monitoring time interval (MTI) determining a remaining time (RT) remaining until the deviations (D(ti)) will exceed said deviation range (DR) by: for at least two different deviation pairs (k), each comprising a first and a second deviation (D1<sub>k</sub>(t1<sub>k</sub>), D2<sub>k</sub>(t2<sub>k</sub>)) determined based on the filtered deviations (FD(ti)), determining a simulated value (SRT<sub>k</sub>) of the remaining time (RT) by performing a Monte Carlo simulation based on the noise (N) and the respective deviation pair (k), based on the simulated values (SRT<sub>k</sub>) determining the remaining time (RT), and generating an output informing about the remaining time (RT).
