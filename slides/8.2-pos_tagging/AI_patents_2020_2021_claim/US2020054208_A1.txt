DIAGNOSTIC CLASSIFICATION OF CORNEAL SHAPE ABNORMALITIES
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are systems and methods for characterizing corneal shape abnormalities. These methods may be used to differentiate corneas having subclinical keratoconus from other conditions which cause distortion of corneal shape, including warpage of the cornea due to contact lens wear. Also disclosed is classification scheme to aid diagnosis of corneal conditions and thereby guide clinical decision making regarding patient treatment. This classification scheme is based on computed properties of corneal shape, is amenable to automation, and may be implemented in an integrated system or provided in the form of software encoded on a computer-readable medium.

<claims>
1. 1-26. (canceled)
27. A computer-based method of classifying corneal shape abnormalities, the method comprising: combining data from at least two of the following corneal maps of a cornea: a topography map, a pachymetry map, and an epithelial thickness mapâ€”to obtain one or more indices of corresponding distortion; and detecting one or more corneal shape abnormalities in the cornea based on the one or more indices of corresponding distortion.
28. The method of claim 27, wherein the topography map, the epithelial thickness map, and the pachymetry map are pattern deviation (PD) maps.
29. The method of claim 28, wherein combining the data from the at least two corneal maps includes fitting a function on a first one of the corneal maps to obtain a first fitted function and fitting the function on a second one of the corneal maps to obtain a second fitted function; and combining the first and second fitted functions.
30. The method of claim 29, wherein the function is a Gaussian function.
31. The method of claim 30, wherein the first fitted function and the second fitted function are combined via multiplication.
32. The method of claim 27, wherein the combining the data from the at least two corneal maps includes determining a covariance between a first one of the corneal maps and a second one of the corneal maps.
33. The method of claim 27, wherein the one or more indices of corresponding distortion includes an ectasia index obtained by combining data from the topography map and the pachymetry map.
34. The method of claim 27, wherein the one or more indices of corresponding distortion includes a coincident-thinning index obtained by combining data from the pachymetry map and the epithelial thickness map.
35. The method of claim 27, wherein the one or more indices of corresponding distortion includes a warpage index obtained by combining data from the topography map and the epithelial thickness map.

37. The method of claim 27, wherein the topography map is a mean curvature map of the posterior surface of the cornea.
38. The method of claim 27, wherein one or more of the topography map, the pachymetry map, or the epithelial thickness map are obtained using optical coherence tomography.
39. A computer-based method of classifying corneal shape abnormalities, the method comprising: obtaining an epithelial thickness map of a cornea; obtaining a pachymetry map of the cornea; determining a coincident-thinning (CT) index based on the epithelial thickness map and the pachymetry map; and classifying the cornea based on the CT index.
40. The method of claim 39, wherein the epithelial thickness map and the pachymetry map are pattern deviation (PD) maps.
41. The method of claim 40, wherein determining the CT index includes: fitting a function on the epithelial thickness map and the pachymetry map to generate a fitted epithelial function and a fitted pachymetry function; and combining the fitted epithelial function and the fitted pachymetry function.
42. The method of claim 41, wherein the function is a Gaussian function, and wherein the fitted epithelial function and the fitted pachymetry function are combined via multiplication.
43. The method of claim 39, further comprising: obtaining a topography map of the subject's cornea; and determining warpage index based on the topography map and the epithelial thickness map; wherein the cornea is classified further based on the warpage index.
44. The method of claim 43, wherein the topography map is a mean curvature map of an anterior surface of the cornea.
45. The method of claim 39, further comprising: determining an epithelial thickness pattern standard deviation (PSD) value based on the epithelial thickness map; wherein the cornea is classified further based on the epithelial thickness PSD value.
46. The method of claim 39, further comprising: obtaining an anterior topography map of the subject's cornea; and determining a pachymetry anterior topography (PAT) index based on the anterior topography map and the pachymetry map; wherein the cornea is classified further based on the PAT index.
