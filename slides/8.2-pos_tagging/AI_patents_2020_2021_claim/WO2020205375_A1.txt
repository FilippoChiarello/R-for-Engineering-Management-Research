SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR THIRD PARTY DATA MANAGEMENT
</title>

<abstract>
Described herein is a third party data management system that uses a classification algorithm trained using a machine learning process to analyze type(s) of data that will be shared with the third party to determine a risk of sharing data with the third party. Periodically data provided to a particular third party can be analyzed to identify privacy issue(s). In response to the analysis, an action to be taken with respect to the particular third party can be identified and provided to a user. In some embodiments, information from trusted news feeds can be processed using natural language processing to determine a potential privacy or security issue regarding a third party with whom data has been shared.

<claims>
1. A third party data management system, comprising:
a computer comprising a processor and a memory having computer-executable instructions stored thereupon which, when executed by the processor, cause the computer to:
receive a request to add a third party for sharing of data;
using a classification algorithm trained using a machine learning process, analyze one or more types of data that will be shared with the third party to determine a risk of sharing data with the third party; and
provide information to a user regarding the determined risk of sharing data with the third party.
2. The system of claim 1, the memory having computer-executable instructions stored thereupon which, when executed by the processor, cause the computer to:
analyze a contractual agreement with the third party based, at least in part, up the determined risk of sharing data with the third party to determine whether an additional contractual term is likely needed; and
when it is determined that the additional contractual term is likely needed, provide information to the user regarding the additional contractual term.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the classification algorithm comprises at least one of a linear regression algorithm, a logistic regression algorithm, a decision tree algorithm, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, a Naive Bayes algorithm, a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a K-means algorithm, a random forest algorithm, a dimensionality reduction algorithm, an Artificial Neural Network, and/or a Gradient Boost & Adaboost algorithm.
4. The system of claim 1, the memory having computer-executable instructions stored thereupon which, when executed by the processor, cause the computer to:
train the classification algorithm using a machine learning process that utilizes various features present in at least one of the data or types of data with the classification algorithm representing an association among the features.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the classification algorithm is trained in at least one of a supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised manner.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the classification algorithm is adaptively updated based, at least in part, upon a user's interaction with the information provided to the user regarding the determined risk of sharing data with the third party.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the classification algorithm is trained to classify data in accordance with particular rules.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the particular rules are based, at least in part, upon, at least one of a contractual requirement, an entity requirement, a governmental requirement, a temporal requirement, or a geographical requirement.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein the particular rules set forth a plurality of categories of data to be used by the classification algorithm, and, criteria for classifying data into each of the plurality of categories.
10. A method, comprising:
using a classification algorithm trained using a machine learning process, periodically analyzing data provided to a particular third party to identify one or more privacy issues;
in response to the analysis, identifying an action to be taken with respect to the particular third party;
presenting information to a user regarding the identified action.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the action comprises an additional contract term to be added to an existing contractual relationship with the particular third party.
12. The method of claim 10, further comprising:
adaptively updating the classification algorithm based, at least in part, upon a user's interaction with the information provided to the user.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein the classification algorithm is trained to classify data in accordance with particular rules.
14. A computer storage media storing computer-readable instructions that when executed cause a computing device to:
receive information from one or more trusted news feeds;
using natural language processing, determine a potential privacy or security issue regarding a third party with whom data has been shared; and
provide information to a user regarding the determined potential privacy or security issue regarding the third party.
15. The computer storage media of claim 14 storing further computer-readable instructions that when executed cause a computing device to:
determine a risk assessment associated with the potential privacy or security issue; and
when the determined risk assessment is greater than a threshold, initiate a process for preventing further data sharing with the third party.
