<title>
System and methods for data evaluation through network sensitivity analysis
</title>

<abstract>
A method for evaluating a relative contribution of a first group of J data sets in a collection of N data sets, wherein N>J, includes first applying the collection of N data sets and second applying the first group of J data sets to a model and generating one or more observations O on the collection of N data sets and the first group of J data sets, including generating a N NSA curve comprising computing, using the model, an observation ON on the collection of N data sets; and generating a N−J NSA curve for the first group of J data sets by removing the first group of J data sets from the collection of N data sets, and generating, using the model, an observation ON−J with the first group of J data sets removed. The method then includes generating a measure MJ of contributions of the group of J data sets based on the N NSA curve and the N−J NSA curves.
