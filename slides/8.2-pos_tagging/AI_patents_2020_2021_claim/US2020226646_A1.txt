DOCUMENT TERM RECOGNITION AND ANALYTICS
</title>

<abstract>
A device receives image data of a contractual document that includes an offer including terms of a proposed transaction, converts the image data to text data that identifies text within the contractual document, and receives preferences information for a recipient of the offer. The device identifies key terms within the contractual document by using term identification to analyze the text. The key terms may include a first key term that identifies subject matter of the proposed transaction and other key terms that are part of the offer. The device determines term scores that correspond to likelihoods of the other key terms being favorable to the recipient by using a data model to analyze the key terms and the preferences information. The device, based on the term scores, generates and provides another device with a recommendation to be used in determining whether the accept the offer.
