SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SELF-ADJUSTING CYBERSECURITY ANALYSIS AND SCORE GENERATION
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for self-adjusting cybersecurity analysis and score generation, wherein a reconnaissance engine gathers data about a client's computer network from the client, from devices and systems on the client's network, and from the Internet regarding various aspects of cybersecurity. Each of these aspects is evaluated independently, weighted, and cross-referenced to generate a cybersecurity score by aggregating individual vulnerability and risk factors together to provide a comprehensive characterization of cybersecurity risk using a transparent and traceable methodology. The scoring system itself can be used as a state machine with the cybersecurity score acting as a feedback mechanism, in which a cybersecurity score can be set at a level appropriate for a given organization, and data from clients or groups of clients with more extensive reporting can be used to supplement data for clients or groups of clients with less extensive reporting to enhance cybersecurity analysis and scoring.

<claims>
1. A system for self-adjusting cybersecurity analysis and rating based on heterogeneous data and reconnaissance, comprising: a computing device comprising a memory, a processor, and a network interface; a high volume web crawler comprising a first plurality of programming instructions stored in the memory of, and operating on the processor of, the computing device, wherein the first plurality of programming instructions, when operating on the processor, cause the computing device to obtain information from the Internet as directed by an automated planning service module; an automated planning service module, comprising a second plurality of programming instructions stored in the memory of, and operating on the processor of, the computing device, wherein the second plurality of programming instructions, when operating on the processor, cause the computing device to periodically or continuously establish a score for one or more of the following aspects of cybersecurity analysis by: defining a target network by identifying internet protocol addresses and subdomains of the target network, verifying domain name system information for each internet protocol address and subdomain of the target network, and assigning an Internet reconnaissance score; collecting domain name system leak information by identifying improper network configurations in the internet protocol addresses and subdomains of the target network, and assigning a domain name system leak information score; identifying web applications used by the target network, analyzing web applications used by the target network to identify vulnerabilities in the web applications that could allow unauthorized access to the target network, and assigning a web application security score; identifying personnel within the target network, searching social media networks for information of concern related to the personnel identified within the target network, and assigning a social network score; conducting a scan of the target network for open TCP/UDP ports, and assigning an open port score; identifying leaked credentials associated with the target network that are found to be disclosed in previous breach incidents, and assigning a credential score; gathering version and update information for hardware and software systems within the boundary of the target network, checking version and update information for the hardware and software systems within the boundary of the target network, and assigning a patching frequency score; and identifying content of interest contained within the target network, performing an Internet search to identify references to the content of interest, and assigning an open-source intelligence score; and a cybersecurity scoring engine comprising a third plurality of programming instructions stored in the memory of, and operating on the processor of, the computing device, wherein the third plurality of programming instructions, when operating on the processor, cause the computing device to create a weighted cybersecurity score by: assigning a weight to each of the Internet reconnaissance score, the domain name system leak information score, the web application security score, the social network score, the open port score, the credential score, the patching frequency score, and the open-source intelligence score; combining the weighted scores into the weighted cybersecurity score; and a feedback engine comprising a fourth plurality of programming instructions stored in the memory of, and operating on the processor of, the computing device, wherein the fourth plurality of programming instructions, when operating on the processor, cause the computing device to: compare the weighted cybersecurity score to a score set point; recommend changes to network security to either increase or decrease network security to bring the score into equilibrium with the score set point.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising a task scheduling engine comprising a fifth plurality of programming instructions stored in the memory of, and operating on the processor of, the computing device, wherein the fifth plurality of programming instructions, when operating on the processor, cause the computing device to schedule computer tasks and programs to run at certain intervals.
3. A system for self-adjusting cybersecurity analysis and rating based on heterogeneous data and reconnaissance, comprising the steps of: establishing a score for one or more of the following aspects of cybersecurity analysis by: defining a target network by identifying internet protocol addresses and subdomains of the target network, verifying domain name system information for each internet protocol address and subdomain of the target network, and assigning an Internet reconnaissance score; collecting domain name system leak information by identifying improper network configurations in the internet protocol addresses and subdomains of the target network, and assigning a domain name system leak information score; identifying web applications used by the target network, analyzing web applications used by the target network to identify vulnerabilities in the web applications that could allow unauthorized access to the target network, and assigning a web application security score; identifying personnel within the target network, searching social media networks for information of concern related to the personnel identified within the target network, and assigning a social network score; conducting a scan of the target network for open TCP/UDP ports, and assigning an open port score; identifying leaked credentials associated with the target network that are found to be disclosed in previous breach incidents, and assigning a credential score; gathering version and update information for hardware and software systems within the boundary of the target network, checking version and update information for the hardware and software systems within the boundary of the target network, and assigning a patching frequency score; and identifying content of interest contained within the target network, performing an Internet search to identify references to the content of interest, and assigning an open-source intelligence score; and creating a weighted cybersecurity score by: assigning a weight to each of the Internet reconnaissance score, the domain name system leak information score, the web application security score, the social network score, the open port score, the credential score, the patching frequency score, and the open-source intelligence score; and combining the weighted scores into the weighted cybersecurity score; comparing the weighted cybersecurity score to a score set point; recommending changes to network security to either increase or decrease network security to bring the score into equilibrium with the score set point.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising the step of scheduling computer tasks and programs to run at certain intervals.
