<title>
DETECTION OF COLORECTAL CANCER
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides, among other things, methods for colorectal cancer screening and compositions related thereto. In various embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods for colorectal cancer screening that include analysis of methylation status of one or more methylation biomarkers, and compositions related thereto. In various embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods for colorectal cancer screening that include screening methylation status of one or more methylation biomarkers in cfDNA, e.g., in ctDNA. In various embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods for colorectal cancer screening that include screening methylation status of one or more methylation biomarkers in cfDNA, e.g., in ctDNA, using MSRE-qPCR.

<claims>
1. A method of screening for colorectal cancer, the method comprising determining the methylation status of one or more colorectal cancer methylation loci selected from: (a) one or more genes according to Table 1; and/or (b) one or more differentially methylated regions (DMRs) according to Table 7, in DNA of a human subject, and diagnosing colorectal cancer in the subject.
2. 2.-3. (canceled)
4. The method of claim 1, the method comprising determining whether the one or more methylation loci are hypermethylated as compared to a reference, wherein hypermethylation is indicative of colorectal cancer.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the method comprises determining the methylation status of at least one DMR of each of ZNF471 and FGF14.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the method comprises determining the methylation status of at least one DMR of each of ZNF471, FGF14, and PDGFD.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the method comprises determining the methylation status of at least one DMR of each of ZNF471, FGF14, PDGFD, and ADAMTS2.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the method comprises determining the methylation status of at least one DMR of each of ZNF471, FGF14, PDGFD, ADAMTS2, ZNF492, ST6GALNAC5.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the method comprises determining the methylation status of at least one DMR of each of ZNF471, FGF14, PDGFD, ADAMTS2, ZNF492, ST6GALNAC5, ZNF542, LONRF2, ZNF132, CNRIP1, and ALK.
10. 10.-15. (canceled)
16. The method of claim 1, wherein the DNA is isolated from blood, plasma, urine, saliva, or stool of the human subject.
17. The method of claim 1, wherein the DNA is cell-free DNA of the human subject.
18. 18-25. (canceled)
26. The method of claim 1, wherein the method provides a sensitivity for colorectal cancer of at least 0.6.
27. (canceled)
28. The method of claim 1, wherein the method provides a specificity for colorectal cancer of at least 0.7.
29. (canceled)
30. The method of claim 1, wherein methylation status is determined using one or more members selected from the group consisting of methylation sensitive restriction enzyme quantitative polymerase chain reaction (MSRE-qPCR), Methylation-Specific PCR, Methylation Specific Nuclease-assisted Minor-allele Enrichment PCR, and next-generation sequencing.
31. A kit for use in colorectal cancer screening, the kit comprising: (a) at least one oligonucleotide primer pair of Table 13, and (b) at least one methylation specific restriction enzyme and/or a bisulfite reagent.
32. A diagnostic qPCR reaction for screening of colorectal cancer, the diagnostic qPCR reaction including: (a) human DNA; (b) a polymerase; and (c) at least one oligonucleotide primer pair of Table 13.
33. The kit of claim 31, wherein the oligonucleotide primer pairs include oligonucleotide primer pairs for amplification of DMRs ZNF471 '558 and FGF14 '577.
