USER-ASSISTED PLUG-IN APPLICATION RECIPE EXECUTION
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for user-assisted plug-in application recipe (PIAR) execution are disclosed. During execution of a PIAR, a PIAR management application applies one or more data values for a plug-in application field to a machine learning model, to obtain: (a) a candidate mapping between one or more sub-values discovered within the data value(s) and another field accepted by an action of another plug-in application, the data value(s) being of a data type different from a reported data type of the other field, and (b) a confidence metric associated with the candidate mapping, based at least in part on whether the sub-value(s) fit(s) one or more stored formats mapped to the other data type. Based on a determination that the confidence metric does not satisfy a threshold confidence criterion, the PIAR management application obtains user input affirming or rejecting the candidate mapping, and applies the user input to execution of the PIAR.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. One or more non-transitory machine-readable media storing instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause:
executing, by a plug-in application recipe (PIAR) management application operating in a userindependent execution mode, a particular PIAR according to a particular PIAR definition of a plurality of PIAR definitions managed by the PIAR management application, wherein each PIAR definition in the plurality of PIAR definitions identifies, respectively:
(a) a trigger corresponding to a condition that the PIAR management application
evaluates, on an ongoing basis, based at least in part on data supplied by one or more plug-in applications to the PIAR management application, and
(b) an action to be performed when the condition is satisfied;
during execution of the particular PIAR in the user-independent execution mode, applying a first one or more data values for a first field of a first plug-in application to a machine learning model, to obtain:
(a) a first candidate mapping between a first one or more sub-values discovered within the first one or more data values and a second field accepted by an action of a second plug-in application, wherein the first one or more data values for the first field is of a first data type that is different from a second data type of the second field as reported by the second plug-in application, and
(b) a first confidence metric associated with the first candidate mapping, the first
confidence metric based at least in part on whether the first one or more sub values fit one or more stored formats mapped to the second data type;
based on a first determination that the first confidence metric does not satisfy a threshold
confidence criterion:
obtaining user input affirming or rejecting the first candidate mapping;
applying the user input to execution of the particular PIAR in the user-independent execution mode.
2. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein the first confidence metric is further based on whether a second one or more sub-values discovered within the first one or more data values fit the one or more stored formats mapped to the second data type.
3. The one or more media of claim 2, wherein the first confidence metric is further based at least in part on positions of the first one or more sub-values and the second one or more sub values in the first one or more data values.
4. The one or more media of claim 2, wherein the first one or more sub-values and the second one or more sub-values map to different formats and the first confidence metric is further based at least in part on stored weights associated with the different formats.
5. The one or more media of claim 2, wherein the first confidence metric is further based at least in part on different contexts surrounding the first one or more sub-values and the second one or more sub-values, wherein one of the different contexts is weighted higher than another of the different contexts.
6. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein the first one or more data values comprises one or more of: (a) data that the PIAR management application evaluates to determine whether a particular trigger condition associated with the particular PIAR is satisfied, and (b) data generated by a particular action performed subsequent to detection of the particular trigger condition associated with the particular PIAR.
7. The one or more media of claim 1, further storing instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause:
updating the machine learning model based on the user input. 8 The one or more media of claim 7, further storing instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause:
subsequent to updating the machine learning model and during execution of the particular PIAR in the user-independent execution mode, applying a second one or more data values for the first field of the first plug-in application to the machine learning model, to obtain:
(a) a second candidate mapping between a second one or more sub-values discovered within the second one or more data values and the second field accepted by the action of the second plug-in application, wherein the second one or more data values for the first field is of the first data type that is different from the second data type as reported by the second plug-in application, and
(b) a second confidence metric associated with the second candidate mapping, the second confidence metric based at least in part on whether the second one or more sub values fit the one or more stored formats mapped to the second data type;
based on a second determination that the second confidence metric satisfies the threshold
confidence criterion:
continuing the execution of the particular PIAR in the user-independent execution mode, without requesting user input to affirm or reject the second candidate mapping.
9. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model is configured to identify one or more canonical data types in unstructured data.
10. The one or more media of claim 9, wherein the one or more canonical data types comprise one or more of: a date; a name; an email address; a currency amount; or a physical address.
11. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model performs semantic analysis on the data.
12. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein the user input affirms or rejects the first candidate mapping.
13. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein the user input further comprises a request to interrupt the user-independent execution mode more or less frequently in circumstances associated with the first data.
14. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein obtaining the user input comprises:
generating a request for a user to provide input affirming or rejecting the first candidate
mapping;
transmitting the request to the user;
receiving the user input responsive to the request.
15. The one or more media of claim 14, wherein the request for the user to provide input affirming or rejecting the first candidate mapping comprises a plurality of candidate mappings between different sub-values of the first one or more data values and the second field accepted by the action of the second plug-in application.
16. The one or more media of claim 15, wherein the user input comprises a selection of the first candidate mapping from the plurality of candidate mappings.
17. The one or more media of claim 1 :
wherein the particular PIAR is a branched PIAR configured to carry out either a first action or a second action depending on a type of the first one or more sub-values;
wherein the user input selects between the first action and the second action.
18. The one or more media of claim 1, wherein the first candidate mapping and the first confidence score are further based on applying a second one or more data values for a third field of a third plug-in application to the machine learning model.
