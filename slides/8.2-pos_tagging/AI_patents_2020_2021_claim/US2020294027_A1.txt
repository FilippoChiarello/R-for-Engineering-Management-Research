Transaction card and information displaying method
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are a transaction card and an information displaying method. The transaction card includes a card body, a power supply, a graphic code generation circuit, and a display device. The power supply, the graphic code generation circuit, and the display device are embedded within the card body. The power supply is connected to the graphic code generation circuit and the display device. The graphic code generation circuit is configured to generate a graphic transaction code based on transaction account information of a user. The display device is configured to display the graphic transaction code.

<claims>
1. A transaction card corresponding to a server that provides a transaction service, the transaction card comprising: a card body, a power supply, a communication circuit, a graphic code generation circuit, and a display device, wherein: the power supply, the graphic code generation circuit, and the display device are embedded within the card body, and the power supply is connected to the graphic code generation circuit and the display device; the communication circuit is connected to the power supply, the graphic code generation circuit, and the display device, and configured to receive target information sent by the server for the transaction card and/or sending a target request message to the server, and the communication circuit includes a near field communication circuit configured to communicate with a user terminal via a near field communication connection; the graphic code generation circuit is configured to: generate, when the transaction card is not connected to the server, a graphic transaction code based on transaction account information of a user; periodically generate a new graphic transaction code, and replace the graphic transaction code displayed by the display device with the new graphic transaction code; and generate a first graphic transaction code and a second graphic transaction code, the second graphic transaction code being a graphic payment collection code, and the first graphic transaction code being a graphic payment code; and the display device is configured to display the graphic transaction code and the new graphic transaction code.
2. The transaction card according to claim 1, wherein the communication circuit further comprises one or more of a Wi-Fi module and a radio frequency module.
3. The transaction card according to claim 1, wherein the transaction card further comprises a positioning module, the positioning module being connected to the power supply and the display device, and the positioning module being configured to acquire current location information and displaying the current location information through the display device.
4. The transaction card according to claim 1, wherein the transaction card further comprises a function button, the function button being connected to the power supply, the display device, and the communication circuit, wherein after the function button is pressed, information corresponding to the function button is sent from the server through the communication circuit, and the information corresponding to the function button is displayed through the display device.
5. The transaction card according to claim 1, wherein the second graphic transaction code is disposed in an area of the transaction card.
6. The transaction card according to claim 1, wherein the display device includes electronic paper.
7. The transaction card according to claim 1, wherein the graphic transaction code is a bar code, a QR code, or a password code.
8. An information displaying method applied to a transaction card, wherein the transaction card corresponds to a server that provides a transaction service and comprises a card body, a power supply, a communication circuit, a graphic code generation circuit, and a display device, wherein the power supply, the communication circuit, the graphic code generation circuit, and the display device are embedded within the card body, and the power supply is connected to the communication circuit, the graphic code generation circuit and the display device, and the method comprises: acquiring, by the communication circuit, the transaction account information of a user; generating, by the graphic code generation circuit when the transaction card is not connected to the server, a graphic transaction code based on the transaction account information, wherein the graphic code generation circuit periodically generates a new graphic transaction code, and replaces the graphic transaction code displayed by the displayed device with the new graphic transaction code, wherein the graphic code generation circuit is further configured to generate a first graphic transaction code and a second graphic transaction code, wherein the second graphic transaction code is a graphic payment collection code, and the first graphic transaction code is a graphic payment code; and displaying, by the display device, the graphic transaction code and the new graphic transaction code.
9. The method according to claim 8, wherein after acquiring transaction account information of the user, the method further comprises: sending, to the server, a graphic code generation request carrying the transaction account information; and receiving, from the server, a response message corresponding to the graphic code generation request, the response message comprising verification information for generating the graphic transaction code.
10. The method according to claim 8, wherein the generating, by the graphic code generation circuit, the graphic transaction code based on the transaction account information comprises: generating, by the graphic code generation circuit, the graphic transaction code based on the transaction account information and the verification information in the response message.
11. The method according to claim 8, wherein the graphic transaction code comprises the first graphic transaction code.
