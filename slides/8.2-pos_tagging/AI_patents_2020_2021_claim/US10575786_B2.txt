<title>
System and method for photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal quality assessment
</title>

<abstract>
This disclosure relates generally to PPG signal quality assessment, and more particularly to, a system and method for sensor agnostic PPG signal quality assessment using morphological analysis. In one embodiment, a method for PPG signal quality assessment includes obtaining a PPG signal captured using a testing device in real-time, and segmenting into a first plurality of PPG signal samples such that length of each of the first plurality of PPG signal samples more than a threshold length. A signal sufficiency check (SSC) is performed for each first PPG signal sample to obtain at least a first set of PPG signal samples complying with the SSC. A set of features is extracted from the first set of PPG signal samples, based on which each PPG signal sample is identified as one of a noisy and clean signal sample using a plurality of Random Forest (RF) models created during the training phase.
