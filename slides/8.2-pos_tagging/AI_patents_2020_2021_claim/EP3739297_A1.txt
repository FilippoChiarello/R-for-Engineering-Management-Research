METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETECTING A VEHICLE PARKING, STOPPING, OR STANDING LOCATION
</title>

<abstract>
An approach is provided for automatic detection of vehicle parking, stopping, and/or standing locations (e.g., parking lots, alleys, loading zones, standing zones, etc.). The approach, for example, involves collecting probe data transmitted from a plurality of vehicles traveling on a road segment. The approach also involves processing the probe data to determine a vehicle behavior indicating a vehicle parking location, a vehicle stopping location, a vehicle standing location, or a combination thereof. The approach further involves flagging the road segment as being associated with the vehicle parking location, the vehicle stopping location, the vehicle standing location, or a combination thereof based on the vehicle behavior to update a geographic database.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: collecting probe data transmitted from a plurality of vehicles traveling on a road segment; processing the probe data to determine a vehicle behavior indicating a vehicle parking location, a vehicle stopping location, a vehicle standing location, or a combination thereof; flagging the road segment as being associated with the vehicle parking location, the vehicle stopping location, the vehicle standing location, or a combination thereof based on the vehicle behavior; and updating a geographic database to indicate the vehicle parking location, the vehicle stopping location, the vehicle standing location, or a combination thereof based on the flagging.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the vehicle parking location, the vehicle stopping location, the vehicle standing location, or a combination thereof includes a parking lot, a loading zone, an alley, a standing zone, or a combination thereof.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the vehicle behavior includes a vehicle standing or moving below a threshold speed while continuing to transmit or to generate the probe data.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the vehicle behavior includes a reoccurrence of a vehicle on the road segment.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: processing the probe data to determine a speed distribution profile of the plurality of vehicles while traveling on the road segment, wherein the vehicle behavior is further based on the speed distribution profile.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the speed distribution profile includes a percentile of the probe data above a percentile threshold that is associated with a zero speed, a speed below a speed threshold, or a combination thereof.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the processing of the probe data comprises: extracting one or more features from the probe data, wherein the vehicle behavior is further based on the one or more features.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising:
processing the one or more features using a machine learning model to determine the vehicle behavior.
9. The method of claim 7, further comprising:
comparing the one or more features to respective feature threshold values to determine vehicle behavior.
10. The method of claim 7, wherein the one or more features include a probe speed, a probe speed ratio, a reoccurrence of a probe identifier in the probe data over the period of time, a vehicle count, a roadway shape of the road segment, a feature location label, or a combination thereof.
11. An apparatus comprising: at least one processor; and at least one memory including computer program code for one or more programs, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause the apparatus to perform at least the following, collect probe data transmitted from a plurality of vehicles traveling on a road segment, wherein the probe data is collected; process the probe data to determine a vehicle behavior indicating a vehicle parking location, a vehicle stopping location, a vehicle standing location, or a combination thereof; flag the road segment as being associated with the vehicle parking location, the vehicle stopping location, the vehicle standing location, or a combination thereof based on the vehicle behavior; and update a geographic database to indicate the vehicle parking location, the vehicle stopping location, the vehicle standing location, or a combination thereof based on the flagging.
12. The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the vehicle parking location, the vehicle stopping location, the vehicle standing location, or a combination thereof includes a parking lot, a loading zone, an alley, a standing zone, or a combination thereof.
13. The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the vehicle behavior includes a vehicle standing or moving below a threshold speed while continuing to transmit or to generate the probe data.
14. The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the vehicle behavior includes a reoccurrence of a vehicle on the road segment.
15. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause an apparatus to at least perform the following steps: collecting probe data transmitted from a plurality of vehicles traveling on a road segment; processing the probe data to determine a vehicle behavior indicating a vehicle parking location, a vehicle stopping location, a vehicle standing location, or a combination thereof; flagging the road segment as being associated with the vehicle parking location, the vehicle stopping location, the vehicle standing location, or a combination thereof based on the vehicle behavior; and updating a geographic database to indicate the vehicle parking location, the vehicle stopping location, the vehicle standing location, or a combination thereof based on the flagging.
