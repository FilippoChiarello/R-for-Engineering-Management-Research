<title>
Image analysis and prediction based visual search
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and computer programs are presented for adding new features to a network service. A method includes receiving an image depicting an object of interest. A category set is determined for the object of interest and an image signature is generated for the image. Using the category set and the image signature, the method identifies a set of publications within a publication database and assigns a rank to each publication. The method causes presentation of the ranked list of publications at a computing device from which the image was received.
