MEDICAL INFORMATION PROCESSING APPARATUS AND INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides a medical information processing apparatus that comprises: a selection unit that selects, from among candidate data including surgery data acquired during surgery, target data corresponding to selection conditions that include a condition relating to a patient attribute, a condition relating to a surgical-procedure type, and a condition relating to a disease type; an extraction unit that detects a feature from the selected target data and extracts, from the target data, feature data corresponding to the detected feature; and an editing processing unit that edits the extracted feature data, wherein the extraction unit extracts at least a medical image as the feature data.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A medical information processing apparatus, comprising: a selection unit that selects, from candidate data including surgery data acquired during surgery, target data corresponding to selection conditions that include conditions relating to patient attributes, conditions relating to surgical-procedure types, and conditions relating to disease types; an extraction unit that detects a feature from the selected target data and extracts feature data corresponding to the detected feature, from the target data; and an editing processing unit that edits the extracted feature data, wherein the extraction unit extracts at least a medical image as the feature data.
2. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the extraction unit extracts the feature data by using a model that has learned by machine learning.
3. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the extraction unit learns the target data corresponding to the selection condition.
4. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the machine learning is deep learning.
5. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the target data includes a medical captured image captured by an imaging device during surgery, and the medical image is the medical captured image.
6. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the target data includes a medical illustration image, and the medical image is a medical illustration image.
7. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the target data includes non-image data, and the extraction unit detects a feature from the non-image data.
8. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the target data includes sound collected by a sound collection device during surgery, and the extraction unit also extracts sound as the feature data.
9. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the target data includes text which is input by an operation to an operating device, and the extraction unit also extracts text as the feature data.
10. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the extraction unit detects a state-related feature and/or an action-related feature from the target data.
11. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 10, wherein the extraction unit detects, as the state-related feature, a point in time in the target data when a predetermined state is detected from the target data and detects, as the action-related feature, a point in time in the target data when a predetermined action is detected from the target data.
12. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the editing processing unit edits the feature data to generate protocol data for a case-related surgical procedure.
13. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 12, wherein the editing processing unit generates the protocol data for the surgical procedure from a plurality of cases.
14. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a display controller that causes a display screen to display the medical image corresponding to the surgery data acquired during surgery.
15. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 14, wherein the selection unit selects the target data by setting the selection condition based on the surgery data acquired during surgery, and the extraction unit extracts medical images by detecting features from the selected target data and causes a display screen to display the medical image corresponding to the surgery data, among the extracted medical images.
16. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 15, wherein the extraction unit also issues notification regarding the grounds for extracting the medical images displayed on the display screen.
17. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 15, wherein the medical image corresponding to the surgery data and displayed on the display screen correspond to a navigation image during surgery.
18. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 1, comprising: an arm controller that controls the action of an arm capable of carrying a medical instrument, wherein the arm controller specifies a surgery progress status based on the feature data corresponding to the surgery data acquired during surgery and controls the action of the arm such that the medical instrument corresponding to the specified progress status is carried to a predetermined position corresponding to the specified progress status.
19. An information processing method executed by a medical information processing apparatus, the method comprising the steps of: selecting, from among candidate data including surgery data acquired during surgery, target data corresponding to selection conditions that include a condition relating to a patient attribute, a condition relating to a surgical-procedure type, and a condition relating to a disease type; detecting a feature from the selected target data and extracting, from the target data, feature data corresponding to the detected feature; and editing the extracted feature data, wherein, in the step of extracting, at least a medical image is extracted as the feature data.
