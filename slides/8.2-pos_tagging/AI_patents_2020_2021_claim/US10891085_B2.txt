System, network architecture and method for accessing and controlling an electronic device
</title>

<abstract>
A system, network architecture and method for accessing and controlling an electronic device enable a user to change the function and functionality of an electronic device located either proximate to or remote from the user. With a user device such as a smartphone, a user can port functionality to an electronic device that enables the electronic device to function in a way dictated by the user. In particular, the electronic device can be made to function in a way that the device is capable of functioning, but for which the device is currently not programmed to function.

<claims>
1. A system for enabling a target electronic device to be controlled by a user electronic device having at least one function, the system comprising: a smart box connectable to at least one network and to the target electronic device, the smart box having a central processing unit comprising a processor and memory having stored therein general purpose software, and having storable therein smart box special purpose software; and a server connectable to the at least one network and to the smart box, the server having a processor and memory configured for storing therein server special purpose software, wherein the smart box is connectable to the user electronic device via the at least one network and is configured to permit a user of the user electronic device to access at least one preset function of the target electronic device, whereby the target electronic device is enabled to at least one of perform or respond to the at least one function of the user electronic device, and wherein the at least one function of the user electronic device is native to the user electronic device.
2. The system according to claim 1, wherein the at least one function of the user electronic device comprises two-factor authentication.
3. The system according to claim 2, wherein the two-factor authentication comprises fingerprint authentication.
4. The system according to claim 1, wherein the at least one function of the user electronic device comprises voice activation.
5. The system according to claim 4, wherein the at least one network is further configured for connection to a voice recognition server.
6. The system according to claim 1, wherein the at least one network comprises at least one private network.
7. The system according to claim 1, wherein the at least one network comprises at least one public network.
8. The system according to claim 1, wherein the memory of the server is further configured for storing data for configuring the smart box.
9. The system according to claim 1, wherein the memory of the server is further configured for storing usage data for the target electronic device.
10. The system according to claim 9, wherein the smart box is further connectable to the server and further configured for at least one of generating or collecting the usage data for the target electronic device.
11. The system according to claim 1, wherein the target electronic device comprises a multi-function printer (MFP).
12. A method for enabling a target electronic device to be controlled by a user electronic device having at least one function, the method comprising the steps of: connecting a smart box to at least one network and to the target electronic device, the smart box having a central processing unit comprising a processor and memory having stored therein general purpose software, and having storable therein smart box special purpose software; connecting a server to the at least one network and to the smart box, the server having a processor and memory configured for storing therein server special purpose software; connecting the smart box to the user electronic device via the at least one network; operating the smart box to permit a user of the user electronic device to access at least one preset function of the target electronic device, whereby the target electronic device is enabled to at least one of perform or respond to the at least one function of the user electronic device, wherein the at least one function of the user electronic device is native to the user electronic device.
13. The method according to claim 12, wherein the at least one function of the user electronic device comprises two-factor authentication.
14. The method according to claim 12, wherein the at least one network comprises at least one private network.
15. The method according to claim 12, further comprising the step of configuring the memory of the server for storing data for configuring the smart box.
16. The method according to claim 12, further comprising the step of configuring the memory of the server for storing usage data for the target electronic device.
17. The method according to claim 16, further comprising the steps of: connecting the smart box to the server; and configuring the smart box for at least one of generating or collecting the usage data for the target electronic device.
18. At least one non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, comprising a set of instructions for execution by a smart box for enabling a target electronic device to be controlled by a user electronic device having at least one function, which in response to being executed by the smart box, cause the smart box to: connect to a server and to the user electronic device via at least one network; connect to the target electronic device; and permit a user of the user electronic device to access at least one preset function of the target electronic device, whereby the target electronic device is enabled to at least one of perform or respond to the at least one function of the user electronic device, wherein the at least one function of the user electronic device is native to the user electronic device.
19. The least one non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 18, wherein the at least one function of the user electronic device comprises two-factor authentication.
20. The least one non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 18, wherein the at least one network comprises at least one private network.
