DEVICE AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING AN INTERFACE FOR A POWER UTILITY
</title>

<abstract>
A device (20) uses linking rules (40) to process and optionally update a hierarchical substation model (30) of a power system substation. The linking rules (40) determine to which substation object at a first hierarchy level (31) substation objects at further hierarchy level (32, 33) of the hierarchical substation model (30) are to be connected.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A device (20), comprising:
a memory or storage device (21) storing a hierarchical substation model (30) of a power system substation, the hierarchical substation model (30) including substation objects associated with at least two different hierarchy levels (31, 32, 33; 61, 62), the at least two different hierarchy levels including a first hierarchy level (31; 61) and a further hierarchy level (32, 33; 62) lower than the first hierarchy level (31; 61);
a graphical user interface, GUI (23), adapted to display graphical representations of substation objects and adapted to allow a user to create and edit substation objects;
wherein the memory or storage device (21) stores linking rules (40) that determine to which substation object at the first hierarchy level (31; 61) substation objects at the further hierarchy level (32, 33; 62) are to be connected, and wherein the device (20) is adapted to automatically control the GUI (23) based on the stored linking rules (40) when a new substation object at the further hierarchy level (32, 33; 62) is created by the user via the GUI (23), wherein the device (20) is adapted such that, if the substation object at the first hierarchy level (31; 61) does not yet exist when a new substation object at the further hierarchy level (32, 33; 62) is created, the device (20) automatically creates the substation object at the first hierarchy level (31; 61) when the new substation object at the further hierarchy level (32, 33; 62) is created.
2. The device (20) of claim 1, wherein the further hierarchy level (32, 33; 62) corresponds to a Bay.
3. The device (20) of claim 1, wherein the further hierarchy level (32, 33; 62) corresponds to a Diameter.
4. The device (20) of claim 3, wherein the further hierarchy level is a second hierarchy level (32) and the hierarchical substation model (30) further comprises a third hierarchy level (33), wherein the third hierarchy level (33) corresponds to a Diameter Section.
5. The device (20) of any one of claims 2 to 4, wherein the first hierarchy level (31; 61) corresponds to a voltage level.
6. The device (20) of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the hierarchical substation model (30) includes a tree structure, optionally wherein the tree structure is in accordance with the substation section defined in IEC 61850-6.
7. The device (20) of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the device (20) is adapted such that, if the substation object at the first hierarchy level (31; 61) does not yet exist when a new substation object at the further hierarchy level (32, 33; 62) is created, the GUI (23) displays a graphical representation of the new substation object at the further hierarchy level (32, 33; 62) that is automatically connected to the substation object at the first hierarchy level (31; 61).
8. The device (20) of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the device (20) is adapted such that, if the substation object at the first hierarchy level (31; 61) already exists when the new substation object at the further hierarchy level (32, 33; 62) is created, the GUI (23) displays a graphical representation of the new substation object that is automatically connected to the substation object at the first hierarchy level (31; 61).
9. The device (20) of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the substation object at the first hierarchy level is a Busbar.
10. The device (20) of claim 9, wherein the device (20) is adapted to automatically display a graphical representation of a section of the Busbar when a Bay view of the power system substation is displayed.
11. The device (20) of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the substation objects at the further hierarchy level (32, 33; 62) are switching objects (QB1, QB2, QC1, QA1, QB9, QC9).
12. Use of the device (20) according to any one of the preceding claims for configuring, commissioning, monitoring, or controlling operation of a power system substation.
13. A method, comprising:
displaying, based on a hierarchical substation model (30) of a power system substation, graphical representations of substation objects via a graphical user interface, GUI (23), wherein
the hierarchical substation model (30) includes substation objects associated with at least two different hierarchy levels (31, 32, 33; 61, 62), the at least two different hierarchy levels (31, 32, 33; 61, 62) including a first hierarchy level (31; 61) and a further hierarchy level (32, 33; 62) lower than the first hierarchy level (31; 61), and
the GUI (23) allows a user to create and edit substation objects;
automatically creating the substation object at the first hierarchy level when a new substation object at the further hierarchy level is created and the substation object at the first hierarchy level does not yet exist when the new substation object at the further hierarchy level is created; and
automatically controlling the GUI (23) based on linking rules (40) when a new substation object at the further hierarchy level (32, 33; 62) is created by the user via the GUI (23), wherein the linking rules (40) determine to which substation object at the first hierarchy level (31; 61) the created substation object at the further hierarchy level (32, 33; 62) is to be connected.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the hierarchical substation model (30) includes a tree structure in accordance with the substation section defined in IEC 61850-6.
15. The method of claim 13 or 14, performed by the device (20) of any one of claims 1 to 12.
