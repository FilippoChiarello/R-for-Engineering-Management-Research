DISTRIBUTED LEDGER INVESTMENT GOVERNANCE PLATFORM
</title>

<abstract>
A cryptographic system and mechanism for combining the authenticating of industrial activity and processes and placing investments. Embodiments of the present invention can provide a system that allows for transmitting and filtering oil and gas transactions through a comprehensive, interlocking distributed ledger-based supply chain ecosystem and cryptocurrency-enabled capital funding mechanism, so that such transactions can be monetized to reduce costs, execution times, and risk, while elevating information quality.
