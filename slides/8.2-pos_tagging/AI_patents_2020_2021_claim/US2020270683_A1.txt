METHODS FOR OBTAINING EMBRYONIC STEM CELL DNA METHYLATION SIGNATURES
</title>

<abstract>
Stem cell maturation is a fundamental, yet poorly understood aspect of human development. A DNA methylation signature deeply reminiscent of embryonal stem cells was devised to interrogate the evolving character of multiple human tissues. The cell fraction displaying the signature was found to be highly dependent upon developmental stage (fetal vs adult) and in leukocytes, it described a dynamic transition during the first 5 years of life. Significant individual variation in the embryonic signature of leukocytes was evident at birth, in childhood, and throughout adult life. The genes denoting the signature included transcription factors and proteins intimately involved in embryonic development. The DNA methylation signature traces the developmental origin of cells and informs the study of stem cell heterogeneity in humans under homeostatic and pathologic conditions.
