</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and computer readable media for chemical sensor data recognition using an odor detection system with sensor modules.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for detecting the presence of one or more airborne chemical compounds, comprising: receiving sensor data from one or more chemical sensors; extracting one or more features from the sensor data; selecting a group of selected features from among the one or more features; classifying the group of selected features using one or more models; and providing an indication of the airborne chemical compounds based on the classifying.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the extracting includes extracting a portion of time series data from the sensor data.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein selecting the group of selected features includes performing one or more feature selection techniques to determine one or more significant features, wherein the group of selected features includes the one or more significant features.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the classifying includes performing ensemble classification.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the selecting includes performing a heterogeneous feature selection technique including one or more of filtering, wrapping, or an embedded technique.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: identifying the concentration of one or more of the airborne chemical compounds in air.
7. A non-transitory computer readable medium having instructions stored therein that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform a method comprising: receiving sensor data from one or more chemical sensors for detecting one or more airborne chemical compounds; extracting one or more features from the sensor data; selecting a group of selected features from among the one or more features; classifying the group of selected features using one or more models; and providing an indication of sensed material based on the classifying.
8. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 7, wherein the extracting includes extracting a portion of time series data from the sensor data.
9. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 7, wherein selecting the group of selected features includes performing one or more feature selection techniques to determine one or more significant features, wherein the group of selected features includes the one or more significant features.
10. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 7, wherein the classifying includes performing ensemble classification.
11. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 7, wherein the selecting includes performing a heterogeneous feature selection technique including one or more of filtering, wrapping, or an embedded technique.
12. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 7, wherein the sensed material includes one or more gases and their respective concentrations.
13. A system comprising: one or more processors coupled to a non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon software instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform operations including: receiving sensor data from one or more chemical sensors for detecting one or more airborne chemical compounds; extracting one or more features from the sensor data; selecting a group of selected features from among the one or more features; classifying the group of selected features using one or more models; and providing an indication of the one or more airborne chemical compounds based on the classifying.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the extracting includes extracting a portion of time series data from the sensor data.
15. The system of claim 13, wherein selecting the group of selected features includes performing one or more feature selection techniques to determine one or more significant features, wherein the group of selected features includes the one or more significant features.
16. The system of claim 13, wherein the classifying includes performing ensemble classification.
17. The system of claim 13, wherein the selecting includes performing a heterogeneous feature selection technique including one or more of filtering, wrapping, or an embedded technique.
