INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEM AND METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is an information processing system and method, applicable to an environment of two-dimensional image/three-dimensional object recognition using artificial intelligence AI. When using the information processing system of the present invention to perform an information processing method, a data processing operation is performed to determine the event status of the two-dimensional image/three-dimensional stereo information. Then, an event processing action is performed to determine the event status of the two-dimensional image/three-dimensional stereo information, The abnormal event status of the two-dimensional image/three-dimensional information means that an object can not be completely identified, but an object information corresponding to the object is produced, and an identification processing, such as artificial identification/identification processing, and/or, artificial intelligence AI methods, is performed according to the object information to find out what object is most likely represented by the object information.
