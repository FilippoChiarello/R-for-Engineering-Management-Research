Systems and methods for providing content
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods, and non-transitory computer-readable media can generate a set of candidate content items from a plurality of content items that are available in the social networking system for a first user. A corresponding score for each of the candidate content items can be generated based at least in part on one or more social affinity coefficients corresponding to the first user and a respective second user associated with a candidate content item, wherein a social affinity coefficient provides a quantitative measurement of the strength of a relationship between two users. A first set of content items from the set of candidate content items can be determined based at least in part on the respective scores, wherein content items in the first set are included in a content feed provided to the first user.
