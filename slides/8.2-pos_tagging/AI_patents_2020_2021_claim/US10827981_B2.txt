System and method for evaluating a cognitive load on a user corresponding to a stimulus
</title>

<abstract>
System and method for evaluating a cognitive load on a user, corresponding to a stimulus is disclosed. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data corresponding to the stimulus of a user is received. The stimulus corresponds to a mental task performed by the user. The EEG data is split into a plurality of slots. A slot of the plurality of slots comprises a subset of the EEG data. One or more EEG features are extracted from the subset of the EEG data. The one or more EEG features are represented in one of a frequency domain and a time domain. A plurality of data points present in the one or more EEG features is grouped into two or more clusters using an unsupervised learning technique. The two or more clusters comprise one or more data points of the plurality of data points. The one or more data points correspond to a level of the cognitive load.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for evaluating a cognitive load, on a user, corresponding to a stimulus, the method comprising: receiving electroencephalogram (EEG) data of the user, wherein the EEG data is generated corresponding to the stimulus; splitting the EEG data into a plurality of slots, wherein a slot of the plurality of slots comprises a subset of the EEG data; extracting EEG features from the subset of the EEG data, wherein the EEG features are represented in one of a frequency domain and a time domain; computing a cognitive score as a percentage of a number of slots within the plurality of slots reported as a high level of cognitive load within a total number of the plurality of slots; and grouping a plurality of data points present in the EEG features into two or more clusters using an unsupervised learning technique, wherein the two or more clusters comprise one or more data points corresponding to a level of the cognitive load; wherein the cognitive load is based on the cognitive score, computed as a percentage of a number slots reported as a high level of the cognitive load by the user within a total number of the plurality of slots; wherein the unsupervised learning technique comprises a Component-wise Fuzzy c-Means algorithm, and wherein the receiving, the splitting, the extracting and the grouping are performed by a processor using programmed instructions stored in a memory.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising filtering the subset of the EEG data using a Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) Filter.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the EEG features comprises one of a log variance, Hjorth parameters, and band power estimates.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the stimulus corresponds to a mental task performed by the user.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein a level of the cognitive load is a level of difficulty of a mental task, and wherein the level of the cognitive load comprises one of the high level, and a low level depending on the cognitive score.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the high level of the cognitive load is determined when the cognitive score is more than a threshold level.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein the low level of the cognitive load is determined when the cognitive score is less than a threshold level.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the subset of the EEG data is received during a pre-defined time span.
9. A system for evaluating a cognitive load, on a user, corresponding to a stimulus, the system comprising: a processor; and a memory coupled to the processor, wherein the processor executes a plurality of modules stored in the memory, and wherein the plurality of modules comprising: a receiving module configured to receive electroencephalogram (EEG) data of the user, wherein the EEG data is generated corresponding to the stimulus; a splitting module configured to split the EEG data into a plurality of slots, wherein a slot of the plurality of slots comprises a subset of the EEG data; an extracting module configured to extract EEG features from the subset of the EEG data, wherein the EEG features are represented in one of a frequency domain and a time domain; a computing module configured to compute a cognitive score as a percentage of a number of slots within the plurality of slots reported as a high level of cognitive load within a total number of the plurality of slots; and a grouping module configured to group a plurality of data points present in the EEG features into two or more clusters using an unsupervised learning technique, wherein the two or more clusters comprise one or more data points corresponding to a level of the cognitive load; wherein the cognitive load is based on the cognitive score, computed as a percentage of a number slots reported as a high level of the cognitive load by the user within a total number of the plurality of slots; and wherein the unsupervised learning technique comprise a Component-wise Fuzzy c-Means algorithm.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the system further comprises a filtering module to filter the subset of the EEG data using a Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) Filter.
11. The system of claim 9, wherein the EEG features comprises one of a log variance, Hjorth parameters, and band power estimates.
12. A non-transitory computer readable medium embodying a program executable in a computing device for evaluating a cognitive load, on a user, corresponding to a stimulus, the program comprising: a program code for receiving electroencephalogram (EEG) data of the user, wherein the EEG data is generated corresponding to the stimulus; a program code for splitting the EEG data into a plurality of slots, wherein a slot of the plurality of slots comprises a subset of the EEG data; a program code for extracting EEG features from the subset of the EEG data, wherein the one or more EEG features are represented in one of a frequency domain and a time domain; and a program code for grouping a plurality of data points present in the EEG features into two or more clusters using an unsupervised learning technique, wherein the two or more clusters comprise one or more data points corresponding to a level of the cognitive load; wherein the program code evaluates the cognitive load by computing a cognitive score; wherein the cognitive score is computed as a percentage of a number slots reported as a high level of the cognitive load within a total number of the plurality of slots.
