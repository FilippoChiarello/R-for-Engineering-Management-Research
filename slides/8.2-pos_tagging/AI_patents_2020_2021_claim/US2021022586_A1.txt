ENDOSCOPE OBSERVATION ASSISTANCE APPARATUS AND ENDOSCOPE OBSERVATION ASSISTANCE METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An endoscope observation assistance apparatus includes an image information acquiring part to acquire and display a captured image of a luminal organ captured by the endoscope device on a display, a lesion information acquisition part to detect a predetermined lesion based on the captured image and to acquire lesion information regarding the lesion, a lesion disappearance determination part to track the lesion based on the captured image and the lesion information and to determine whether or not the lesion has disappeared from the captured image, and a notification part to notify a determination result when the lesion disappearance determination part determines that the lesion has disappeared from the captured image. Alternatively, the notification part may notify a lesion detection when a short time period passes after the lesion detection by the lesion information acquisition part.

<claims>
1. An endoscope observation assistance apparatus for assisting observation of a luminal organ with an endoscope, the apparatus comprising: an image information acquisition part configured to acquire a captured image of the luminal organ captured by the endoscope and to display the captured image on a display; a lesion information acquisition part configured to detect a predetermined lesion based on the captured image and to acquire lesion information regarding the lesion; a determination part configured to track the lesion based on the captured image and the lesion information and to determine whether or not the lesion has disappeared from the captured image; and a notification part configured to issue a notification of a determination result when the determination part determines that the lesion has disappeared from the captured image.
2. An endoscope observation assistance apparatus for assisting observation of a luminal organ with an endoscope, the apparatus comprising: an image information acquisition part configured to acquire a captured image of the luminal organ captured by the endoscope and to display the captured image on a display; a lesion information acquisition part configured to detect a predetermined lesion based on the captured image and to acquire lesion information regarding the lesion; and a notification part configured to issue a notification of the lesion detection when a predetermined time period passes after the lesion has been detected.
3. The apparatus according to claim 1, comprising a lesion information output part configured to output the captured image of the lesion captured before the lesion disappearance to a predetermined output destination when the determination part determines that the lesion has disappeared from the captured image.
4. The apparatus according to claim 2, comprising a lesion information output part configured to output the captured image of the lesion to a predetermined output destination when the predetermined time period passes after the lesion has been detected.
5. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the notification part is configured to make the notification by outputting a predetermined alarm sound from a sound output part.
6. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the notification part is configured to make the notification by vibrating a vibrator.
7. The apparatus according to claim 1, comprising: an input part configured to receive an input of a confirmation instruction of the lesion by an operator, wherein the notification part is configured to make the notification of the determination result when the determination part determines that the lesion has disappeared from the captured image and the confirmation instruction has not been input through the input part.
8. An endoscope observation assistance method, comprising: a step of acquiring a captured image of a luminal organ captured by an endoscope; a step of detecting a predetermined lesion based on the captured image and acquiring lesion information regarding the lesion; a step of tracking the lesion based on the captured image and the lesion information and notifying that the lesion has been detected when the lesion has disappeared from the captured image or/and when a predetermined time period passes after the lesion has been detected.
9. A non-transitory computer readable storage medium storing a program for causing a computer to function as: a means of acquiring a captured image of a luminal organ captured by an endoscope; a means of detecting a predetermined lesion based on the captured image and acquiring lesion information regarding the lesion; a means of tracking the lesion based on the captured image and the lesion information and notifying that the lesion has been detected when the lesion has disappeared from the captured image or/and when a predetermined time period passes after the lesion has been detected.
