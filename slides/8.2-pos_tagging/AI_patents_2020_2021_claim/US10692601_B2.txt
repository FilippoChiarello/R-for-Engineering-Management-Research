<title>
Controlling devices based on hierarchical data
</title>

<abstract>
In some examples, a computing device may receive hierarchical data having a hierarchical structure including a plurality of levels. The computing device may determine a plurality of features based at least in part on the hierarchical data, and may select a subset of the features at a first level as candidates for consolidating to a next higher level in the hierarchical structure. The computing device may determine that a predicted loss of information from consolidating the subset of features is less than a threshold, and may revise the hierarchical structure to include a consolidated feature at the next higher level, rather than the subset of features. In some examples, a statistical model may be trained based on the revised hierarchical structure and used at least partially to make a determination, send a notification, and/or control a device.
