System and method for launching scattering electromagnetic waves
</title>

<abstract>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, a system includes a transceiver configured to generate an electromagnetic signal conveying first data. A coupler is configured to generate, responsive to the electromagnetic signal, an electromagnetic wave along a surface of a transmission medium, wherein the electromagnetic wave is within a non-optical frequency band, wherein the electromagnetic wave propagates via a cylindrical scattering wave mode along the surface of the transmission medium without requiring an electrical return path.
