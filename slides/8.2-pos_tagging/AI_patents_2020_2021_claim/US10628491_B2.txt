<title>
Cognitive session graphs including blockchains
</title>

<abstract>
A method, system and computer-usable medium for providing cognitive insights comprising receiving data from a plurality of data sources, the plurality of data sources comprising a blockchain data source, the blockchain data source providing blockchain data; processing the data from the plurality of data sources, the processing the data from the plurality of data sources performing data enriching to provide enriched data; generating the cognitive session graph, the cognitive session graph being associated with a session, the cognitive session graph comprising at least some enriched data; and, associating a cognitive blockchain with the cognitive session graph.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implementable method for generating and using a cognitive session graph comprising: receiving data from a plurality of data sources, the plurality of data sources comprising a blockchain data source, the blockchain data source providing blockchain data; processing the data from the plurality of data sources, the processing the data from the plurality of data sources performing data enriching to provide enriched data; providing the blockchain data to a cognitive inference and learning system, the cognitive inference and learning system comprising a cognitive platform, the cognitive platform comprising a cognitive graph, the cognitive graph being derived from the plurality of data sources, the cognitive graph comprising an application cognitive graph, the application cognitive graph comprising a cognitive graph associated with a cognitive application, interactions between the cognitive application and the application cognitive graph being represented as a set of nodes in the cognitive graph; generating the cognitive session graph, the cognitive session graph being associated with a session, the cognitive session graph comprising at least some enriched data, the session comprising a plurality of queries over a period of time, the plurality of queries being stored within the cognitive session graph associated with the session, each query of the plurality of queries being represented as a respective node within the cognitive session graph, the respective node comprising a representation of a time at which the query was asked, the cognitive session graph comprising at least some enriched data, the generating being performed by a cognitive inference and learning system, the cognitive inference and learning system executing on a hardware processor of an information processing system and interacting with the plurality of data sources, the cognitive session graph interacting with the application cognitive graph, interactions between the cognitive application and the application cognitive graph being represented as a set of nodes in the cognitive session graph; performing a cognitive machine learning operation via the cognitive inference and learning system using the blockchain data, the cognitive machine learning operation implementing a cognitive learning technique according to a cognitive learning framework, the cognitive learning framework comprising a plurality of cognitive learning styles and a plurality of cognitive learning categories, each of the plurality of cognitive learning styles comprising a generalized learning approach implemented by the cognitive inference and learning system to perform the cognitive learning operation, each of the plurality of cognitive learning categories referring to a source of information used by the cognitive inference and learning system when performing the cognitive learning operation, an individual cognitive learning technique being associated with a primary cognitive learning style and bounded by an associated primary cognitive learning category, the cognitive machine learning operation applying the cognitive learning technique via a machine learning algorithm to generate a cognitive learning result; associating a cognitive blockchain with the cognitive session graph; updating a knowledge model using the cognitive learning result and the cognitive session graph, the updating being performed via the cognitive platform of the cognitive inference and learning system; and updating a destination based upon the cognitive learning result, the destination comprising the cognitive application, the cognitive application enabling a user to interact with the cognitive learning result.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein: the session is related to at least one of a user, group of users, theme, topic, issue, question, intent, goal, objective, task, assignment, process, situation, requirement, condition, responsibility, location, period of time and a block in a blockchain.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: processing the cognitive session graph and the cognitive blockchain to provide a cognitive insight, the cognitive insight being related to the session.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising: processing the data from the plurality of data sources, the processing the streams of data from the plurality of data sources performing data enriching to provide second enriched data; generating a second cognitive session graph, the second cognitive session graph being associated with a second session, the second cognitive session graph comprising at least some of the second enriched data; and, processing the second cognitive session graph to provide a second cognitive insight, the second cognitive insight being related to the second session.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein: the session and the second session are associated with a single user; the session and the second session correspond to a first purpose and a second purpose, respectively; and, the cognitive insight and the second cognitive insight are related to the first purpose and the second purpose, respectively.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein: the cognitive session graph comprises a user query, the user query being represented as a node within the cognitive session graph; and the node within the cognitive session graph is linked to a node within a universal cognitive graph.
