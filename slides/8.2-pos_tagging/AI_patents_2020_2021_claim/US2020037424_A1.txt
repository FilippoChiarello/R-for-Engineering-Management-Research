AUTOMATED STATIC CONTROL
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the present disclosure related to automated static control. A set of static sensor data may be obtained from two or more static sensors. The set of static sensor data may be analyzed to determine whether a static condition exists. In response to a determination that a static condition exists, a set of mobile static unit data may be collected from one or more mobile static units. The set of mobile static unit data may be analyzed to select a mobile static unit of the one or more mobile static units. An action may be transmitted to the selected mobile static unit, and the selected mobile static unit may be deployed to mitigate the static condition.
