<title>
ROBOTICALLY-ASSISTED CONSTRAINT MECHANISM
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-assisted surgery system for performing a surgical procedure on a patient's anatomy includes a robotic device, a guide coupled to the robotic device, and a computer in communication with the robotic device. The computer is configured to command the robotic device to selectively operate in one of a first mode in which the guide is manually moved by a user or a second mode in which the robotic device autonomously moves the guide. In the first mode, the robotic device is controlled by the computer to constrain motion of the guide to a predefined plane while allowing the guide to be manually moved along the pre-defined plane.

<claims>
1. A computer-assisted surgery system for performing a surgical procedure on a patient's anatomy, the computer-assisted surgery system comprising: a robotic device; a guide coupled to the robotic device; and a computer in communication with the robotic device and configured to command the robotic device to selectively operate in one of a first mode in which the guide is manually moved by a user or a second mode in which the robotic device autonomously moves the guide; wherein, in the first mode, the robotic device is controlled by the computer to constrain motion of the guide to a predefined plane while allowing the guide to be manually moved along the pre-defined plane.
2. The computer-assisted surgery system of claim 1, wherein the guide is configured for insertion of a cutting tool into the guide.
3. The computer-assisted surgery system of claim 1, wherein the computer is further configured to receive a preoperative image dataset of the patient's anatomy.
4. The computer-assisted surgery system of claim 3, wherein the preoperative image dataset comprises x-ray images.
5. The computer-assisted surgery system of claim 3, further comprising a trackable probe, wherein the computer is further configured to register the preoperative image dataset to the patient's anatomy based on data indicative of positions of the trackable probe.
6. The computer-assisted surgery system of claim 1, further comprising a display for displaying images of the patient's anatomy.
7. The computer-assisted surgery system of claim 1, further comprising a camera and a first array of trackable markers attachable to the patient's anatomy.
8. The computer-assisted surgery system of claim 7, wherein the trackable markers are passive reflective markers.
9. The computer-assisted surgery system of claim 1, wherein the robotic device comprises a robotic arm configured to move the guide in at least four degrees of freedom.
10. Storage media storing instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform operations comprising: determining a position of a guide relative to a plane, wherein the guide is coupled to a robotic device; commanding the robotic device to operate in one of a first mode or a second mode, wherein the guide is manually manipulated by a user in the first mode and the robotic device operates autonomously in the second mode; and commanding the robotic device in the first mode to constrain movement of the guide to the virtual plane, with the guide moveable along the virtual plane to reach a target area of a patient's anatomy.
11. The storage media of claim 10, wherein the operations further comprise receiving a preoperative image dataset taken of the patient's anatomy using an imaging modality.
12. The storage media of claim 11, wherein the imaging modality comprises x-ray imaging.
13. The storage media of claim 11, further comprising registering the preoperative image dataset to the patient's anatomy.
14. The storage media of claim 10, wherein the operations further comprise controlling a display device to display images of the patient's anatomy on a display.
15. The storage media of claim 10, wherein the operations further comprise controlling the display device to further display a virtual representation of the plane.
16. The storage media of claim 10, wherein the operations further comprise determining a position of the guide relative to the virtual plane based on tracking data from a camera configured to locate an array of trackable markers attached to the patient's anatomy.
17. A method of operating a robotically-assisted surgical device, comprising: planning a bone resection to obtain a virtual plane defined relative to an anatomical feature; providing a robotic device and a guide coupled to the robotic device; selectively operating the robotic device in one of a first mode in which the guide is manually moved by a user or a second mode in which the robotic device autonomously moves the guide; wherein operating the robotic device in the first mode comprises causing the robotic device to constrain motion of the guide to the virtual plane while allowing the drill guide to be manually moved along the virtual plane.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein operating the robotic device in the second mode comprises performing automated testing procedures.
19. The method of claim 17, wherein planning the bone resection comprises obtaining a preoperative image dataset comprising x-ray images of the anatomical feature.
20. The method of claim 17, wherein the method further comprises coupling an array of reflective markers to the anatomical feature.
