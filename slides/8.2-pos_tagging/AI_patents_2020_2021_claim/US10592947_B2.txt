<title>
Facilitating mitigation of dangerous activities
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques facilitating mitigation of dangerous activities are provided. In one example, a computer-implemented method can include detecting, by a system operatively coupled to a processor, a trigger event based on a determination that a security risk level satisfies a defined condition associated with the security risk level. The security risk level can be associated with an item of interest and a monitored behavior related to the item of interest. The computer-implemented method can also include implementing, by the system, an action that mitigates an impact of the security risk level. The action can be implemented as the trigger event is detected and the action can be determined based on the item of interest and the monitored behavior.

<claims>
1. A computer program product facilitating mitigation of a dangerous activity, the computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by a processing component to cause the processing component to: detect, by the processing component, a trigger event based on a first risk level satisfying a defined condition, wherein the first risk level is associated with a first item of interest and a monitored behavior associated with the first item of interest, wherein the first item of interest comprises ingredients from a harmful recipe database, the first risk level is based on a multidimensional risk array, the monitored behavior comprises a sequential order in which the ingredients are purchased, and the harmful recipe database comprises recipes that can be employed to cause physical harm to at least one entity, and the first risk level provides an indication of a probability that the first item of interest will be employed in a recipe of the recipes to cause the physical harm to the at least one entity; and implement, by the processing component, an action that reduces the first risk level based on the trigger event, wherein the action is selected from a group of actions based on the first risk level, the first item of interest, and the monitored behavior, the action comprising a real-time modification to a website on which the monitored behavior is occurring that reduces the probability that the item of interest will be employed in the recipe of the recipes to cause the physical harm to the at least one entity.
2. The computer program product of claim 1, wherein the program instructions executable by the processing component further cause the processing component to: modify, by the processing component, an attribute related to the monitored behavior comprising a purchase of the first item of interest, wherein the attribute is selected from a group consisting of a price, a timing, a location, a delivery characteristic, and an identity verification.
3. The computer program product of claim 1, wherein the monitored behavior comprises a first event performed in connection with a first entity and a second event performed in connection with a second entity, and wherein the first event and the second event are determined to be related based on an identity of a third entity that caused a performance of the trigger event and a determined relationship between the first entity, the second entity, and the third entity.
4. The computer program product of claim 3, wherein the first event and the second event are online purchases and the first entity and the second entity are different devices associated with respective online merchants.
5. The computer program product of claim 3, wherein the first event is an online purchase and the first entity is a device associated with an online merchant and the second event is an in-store purchase and the second entity is another device associated with a physical store.
6. A system, comprising: a memory that stores computer executable components; and a processor that executes the computer executable components stored in the memory, wherein the computer executable components comprise: an observation component that detects a trigger event based on a risk level satisfying a defined condition of the risk level, wherein the risk level is associated with an item of interest and a monitored behavior associated with the item of interest, wherein the item of interest comprises ingredients from a harmful recipe database comprising recipes that can be employed to cause physical harm to at least one entity, the monitored behavior comprises a sequential order in which the ingredients are purchased, and the security risk level provides an indication of a probability that the item of interest will be employed in a recipe of the recipes to cause the physical harm to the at least one entity; and an implementation component that performs an action that reduces the risk level based on the trigger event, wherein the action is selected from a group of actions based on the risk level, the item of interest, and the monitored behavior, the action comprising a real-time modification to a website on which the monitored behavior is occurring that reduces the probability that the item of interest will be employed in the recipe of the recipes to cause the physical harm to the at least one entity.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the implementation component modifies an attribute related to the monitored behavior comprising a purchase of the item of interest, wherein the attribute is selected from a group consisting of a price, a timing, a location, a delivery characteristic, and an identity verification.
8. The system of claim 6, wherein the implementation component further outputs an alert to an entity distinct from the system.
