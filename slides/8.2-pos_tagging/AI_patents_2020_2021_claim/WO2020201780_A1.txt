VIDEO TIMED ANCHORS
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, are provided, for generating video anchors for a video. In one aspect, a method includes obtaining key moment identifiers for a video, where each key moment identifier includes a time index value specifying a playback time in the video, and is indicative subject matter of the video that has been determined to meet one or more interest criteria that define salient topics within the video. For each key moment identifier, a video anchor is generated, where each video anchor indicates a playback time for the video, and may include an image of a frame that occurs near the playback time. Upon a selection of the video anchor by the user, an instruction in the video anchor causes a video player to begin playback of the video at the playback time specified by the video anchor.
