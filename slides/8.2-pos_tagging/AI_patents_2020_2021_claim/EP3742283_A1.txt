ARITHMETIC PROCESSING DEVICE, METHOD FOR CONTROLLING ARITHMETIC PROCESSING DEVICE, AND PROGRAM FOR CONTROLLING ARITHMETIC PROCESSING DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A method implemented by an arithmetic processing device configured to repeatedly execute similar fixed-point arithmetic operations a plurality of times, the process includes: acquiring, in each of iterations, decimal point position information of the next iteration from statistical information on the arithmetic operations of each of the iterations; calculating an adjustment amount based on a result of comparing the decimal point position information of the next iteration with the already acquired decimal point position information of the previous iteration; and using the decimal point position information of the next iteration and the adjustment amount to execute the fixed-point arithmetic operations in the next iteration.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An arithmetic processing device comprising: an arithmetic execution unit that acquires decimal point position information and an adjustment amount and uses the acquired decimal point position information and the acquired adjustment amount to repeatedly execute similar fixed-point arithmetic operations a plurality of times; an acquirer that acquires, in each of iterations, decimal point position information of the next iteration from statistical information on the arithmetic operations of each of the iterations and provides the acquired decimal point position information to the arithmetic execution unit; and an adjustment amount calculator that calculates an adjustment amount based on a result of comparing the decimal point position information of the next iteration with the decimal point position information of the previous iteration and provides the calculated adjustment amount to the arithmetic execution unit.
2. The arithmetic processing device according to claim 1, wherein
the adjustment amount calculator calculates and provides the adjustment amount every time the fixed-point arithmetic operations are repeatedly executed by the arithmetic execution unit a predetermined number of times.
3. The arithmetic processing device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein
the decimal point position information is a real number specifying the least significant bit among bits indicating a decimal part of a fixed-point number indicated by a plurality of bits that are used in the fixed-point arithmetic operations.
4. The arithmetic processing device according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein
the decimal point position information is represented by an exponent of 2.
5. The arithmetic processing device according to any of claims 1 to 4, wherein
the arithmetic execution unit adds the adjustment amount to an exponent of the decimal point position information provided from the acquirer and sets the adjustment amount with the added exponent to the adjusted decimal point position information to be used in the fixed-point arithmetic operations.
6. The arithmetic processing device according to any of claims 1 to 5, wherein
the acquirer acquires the decimal point position information from statistical information of calculation results obtained in the arithmetic operations of each of the iterations before fixed-point representation is applied.
7. A program for controlling an arithmetic processing device that repeatedly executes similar fixed-point arithmetic operations a plurality of times and causing the arithmetic processing device to execute a process, the process comprising: acquiring, in each of iterations, decimal point position information of the next iteration from statistical information on the arithmetic operations of each of the iterations; calculating an adjustment amount based on a result of comparing the decimal point position information of the next iteration with the decimal point position information of the previous iteration; and using the decimal point position information of the next iteration and the adjustment amount to execute the fixed-point arithmetic operations in the next iteration.
8. A method for controlling an arithmetic processing device that repeatedly executes similar fixed-point arithmetic operations a plurality of times and causing the arithmetic processing device to execute a process, the process comprising: acquiring, in each of iterations, decimal point position information of the next iteration from statistical information on the arithmetic operations of each of the iterations; calculating an adjustment amount based on a result of comparing the decimal point position information of the next iteration with the already acquired decimal point position information of the previous iteration; and using the decimal point position information of the next iteration and the adjustment amount to execute the fixed-point arithmetic operations in the next iteration.
