<title>
Accurate positioning of augmented reality content
</title>

<abstract>
A system for accurately positioning augmented reality (AR) content within a coordinate system such as the World Geodetic System (WGS) may include AR content tethered to trackable physical features. As the system is used by mobile computing devices, each mobile device may calculate and compare relative positioning data between the trackable features. The system may connect and group the trackable features hierarchically, as measurements are obtained. As additional measurements are made of the trackable features in a group, the relative position data may be improved, e.g., using statistical methods.
