<title>
Automated profiling of the condition of wood
</title>

<abstract>
A device for evaluating the condition of a wooden structure, including: a shaft; a distance sensor coupled to the shaft; and an image capture device coupled to the shaft, the distance sensor being configured to measure a location of the image capture device in the wooden structure.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A device for evaluating the condition of a wooden structure, the device comprising: a shaft; a distance sensor coupled to the shaft; and an image capture device coupled to the shaft, the distance sensor being configured to measure a location of the image capture device in the wooden structure; and a computing device configured to: receive image data from the image capture device; and create, based on the image data, a condition profile of the wooden structure, the condition profile showing an approximate length, height, and width of any decayed section in the wooden structure.
2. The device of claim 1, wherein the shaft comprises a first end and a second end, the distance sensor being coupled to the shaft nearer the first end than the second end, and the image capture device being coupled to the shaft nearer the second end than the first end.
3. The device of claim 1, wherein the shaft further comprises a probing tip that surrounds the image capture device.
4. The device of claim 1, further comprising: a retractable cover configured to: cover the image capture device when the shaft is inserted into the wooden structure, and uncover the image capture device when as the shaft is withdrawn from the wooden structure.
5. The device of claim 1, wherein the shaft comprises a probing tip configured to guide, align, or center the shaft within a hole bored in the wooden structure.
6. The device of claim 1, wherein the image capture device comprises a plurality of image capture sensors configured to capture images of an area surrounding at least a portion of the shaft.
7. The device of claim 1, further comprising at least one from among a laser light-source, a light-emitting diode (LED) light source, and an ultra-violet light source.
8. A method for evaluating the condition of a wooden structure, the method comprising: inserting at least a portion of a probing device into the wooden structure, the probing device comprising: a shaft; an image capture device coupled to the shaft; a distance sensor configured to measure a location of the image capture device in the wooden structure; and a computing device configured to: receive image data from the probing device; and create, based on the image data, a condition profile of the wooden structure, the condition profile showing an approximate length, height, and width of any decayed section in the wooden structure; determining, by the computing device and using data from the distance sensor, a location of the image capture device within the wooden structure; capturing image data from within the wooden structure using the image capture device at a first determined location within the wooden structure; and repeating determining and capturing at a second location of the wooden structure.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the image data comprises images of interior surfaces of the wooden structure.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein an appearance of the wooden structure at one or more locations within the structure is correlated with the condition of the wood at a location within the structure.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein the method comprises evaluating the condition of an outer surface of the structure.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the shaft connects the image capture device to the distance sensor, and the method further comprises inserting the shaft into a hole of the wooden structure which extends below ground level to detect internal decay in a wooden structure below ground level without excavation.
13. The method of claim 8 further comprising: receiving a plurality of images that the image capture device acquires inside the wooden structure at a plurality of locations within the structure; and categorizing the condition of the wooden structure based on the plurality of images received from the image capture device.
14. A system for evaluating the condition of a wooden structure, comprising: a probing device for evaluating the condition of the wooden structure, the probing device comprising: a shaft; a distance sensor coupled to the shaft; and an image capture device coupled to the shaft, the distance sensor being configured to measure a location of the image capture device in the wooden structure; and a computing device coupled to the probing device configured to: receive image data from the probing device, process the received image data, and create, based on the image data received from the probing device, a condition profile of the wooden structure, the condition profile showing an approximate length, height, and width of any decayed section in the wooden structure.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the image data is correlated with the condition of the wooden structure at a location within the structure.
16. The system of claim 14, wherein the computing device is further configured to calculate a strength of the wooded structure based on the condition profile.
17. The device of claim 1, wherein the shaft has an end and at least one outer wall, and the image capture device is positioned such that an image capture sensor of the image capture device is facing outward from the at least one outer wall of the shaft.
