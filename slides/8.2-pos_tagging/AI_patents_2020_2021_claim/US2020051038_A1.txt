CALIBRATION OF CLOUD-BASED INFORMATION FOR LIFETIME PREDICTION OF LUMINAIRES
</title>

<abstract>
The described embodiments relate to systems, methods, and apparatuses for estimating luminaire lifetimes using extrapolated sensor data. During a lifetime of a luminaire (108), a sensor (206) of the luminaire can become inoperable well before the entire luminaire becomes inoperable. In order to estimate when the luminaire will become inoperable, sensor data (504) should be continually tracked even after the sensor fails. In order to continue obtaining sensor data after the sensor fails, the sensor data can be extrapolated based on a correlation between previously received sensor data and other environmental data. The extrapolated sensor data can be tracked after the sensor becomes inoperable so that estimates of luminaire lifetime can be more accurate, compared to not having any sensor data. In this way, maintenance of luminaires can be scheduled according to predictions of luminaire lifetimes, rather than the occurrence of a luminaire failure.

<claims>
1. A method for extrapolating data after a sensor of a first device ceases to provide data, the method comprising: receiving first data from the sensor of the first device, the first data comprising a temperature of the first device; receiving second data from a remote device, wherein the second data corresponds to measurements associated with an operational environment of the first device, the second data comprising environmental data; identifying, using one or more processors, a correlation between the first data and the second data; and generating, using one or more processors, subsequent to the sensor ceasing to provide data, extrapolated data based on a correlation between the first data and the second data, and determining an estimated lifetime for the first device based at least on the extrapolated data.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the extrapolated data is generated according to a machine learning algorithm.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the machine learning algorithm is used to derive a correlation function, and generating the extrapolated data includes: providing the second data as an input to the correlation function, which outputs the extrapolated data in response to receiving the second data.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the machine learning algorithm includes a step of generating a decision tree for categorizing the first data received from the sensor.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the estimated lifetime for the device includes comparing the extrapolated data to collected data that is associated with a different device that was previously rendered inoperable.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the estimated lifetime for the device includes determining an amount of the time the device has been operational, and identifying a type of device failure that is associated with the amount of time.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the sensor is a temperature sensor, the extrapolated data is predicted temperature data, and the estimated lifetime for the device is determined at least partially based on a number of temperature cycles experienced by the device as indicated by the predicted temperature data and the first data.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the extrapolated data is also generated prior to the sensor ceasing to provide the first data, and the sensor is temporarily shutdown to stop the sensor from providing the first data.
9. A lighting management system, comprising: a luminaire that includes a sensor for measuring an operating condition of the luminaire, the operating condition comprising a temperature of the luminaire, a memory configured to store sensor data received from the sensor of the luminaire and environmental data received from a remote device that tracks environmental conditions associated with the luminaire; and a processor in communication with the luminaire and the memory, the processor configured to identify a correlation between the sensor data and the environmental data, and use the correlation to generate extrapolated sensor data for storage in the memory after the sensor ceases to provide the sensor data, wherein the processor is further configured to determine an estimated lifetime of one or more components of the luminaire using at least the extrapolated sensor data.
10. The lighting management system of claim 9, wherein the processor is further configured to identify the correlation using a machine learning algorithm that involves pre-processing the environmental data for identifying statistical features of the environmental data.
11. The lighting management system of claim 9, wherein the sensor is a temperature sensor that measures an internal temperature of the luminaire and the environmental data corresponds to an external temperature of the luminaire.
12. The lighting management system of claim 9, wherein the environmental data corresponds to an environmental variable having different units than the sensor data.
13. The lighting management system of claim 9, wherein the processor is further configured to use a statistical regression algorithm for identifying the correlation between the sensor data and the environmental data.
