<title>
AUTOMATED SEARCH RESULT SORTING
</title>

<abstract>
A method of automated search result sorting includes applying a search request to a data set to generate search results, and generating a mean score value and an uncertainty value for each item in the search results by mathematically combining values of characteristics associated with the respective item, taking into account a weighting factor of the characteristic. The method further includes producing, for each of the items, a single score that is a function of the mean score value of that item and the uncertainty value of that item. This includes selecting, as the single score for each item, a value in accord with a probability distribution that is centered about the mean score value for the item and that has a standard deviation defined by the uncertainty value for that item. The method presents items from the search results ordered in accord with the respective single scores produced for them.

<claims>
In view of the foregoing, what is claimed is:
1. A method of automated search result sorting, comprising applying a search request to a data set to generate search results comprising a plurality of items matching the request; generating a mean score value and an uncertainty value for each of the plurality of items; producing, for each of the plurality of items, a single score that is a function of the mean score value of that item and the uncertainty value of that item; presenting items from the search results ordered in accord with the respective single scores produced for them.
2. The method of claim 1, the producing step including selecting as the single score for each item a value in accord with a probability distribution that is centered about the mean score value for the item and that has a standard deviation defined by the uncertainty value for that item.
3. The method of claim 2, the producing step including randomly selecting the single score in accord with the probability distribution.
4. The method of claim 3, the producing step including selecting the single score using a language-specific equivalent and/or distribution-appropriate equivalent of a function norm.inv( ).
5. The method of claim 1, the generating step including generating the mean score value for each item to reflect an estimated degree of desirability of that item, and generating the uncertainty value for each item to reflect an uncertainty in the respective mean score value for that item.
6. The method of claim 1, the generating step including generating the mean score value for each item and the uncertainty value for each item based on characteristics of any of that item, a thing that item represents, a source of the search request and/or target for which results of the search is intended, and/or a combination thereof.
7. The method of claim 1, the generating step including generating the mean score for each item by mathematically combining values of the characteristics associated with the item.
8. The method of claim 7, the generating step including making the mathematical combination taking into account a weighting factor of the respective associated characteristic.
9. The method of claim 7, the generating step including generating the uncertainty value for each item in accord with the mathematical combination used in generating the mean score for that item.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the applying step includes identifying items matching the request to any of an exact, partial and fuzzy degree.
11. A method of automated search result sorting, comprising applying a search request to a data set to generate search results comprising a plurality of items matching the request; generating a mean score value and an uncertainty value for each of the plurality of items, the generating step including generating the mean score for each item by mathematically combining values of the characteristics associated with the item taking into account a weighting factor of the respective associated characteristic; producing, for each of the plurality of items, a single score that is a function of the mean score value of that item and the uncertainty value of that item, the producing step including selecting as the single score for each item a value in accord with a probability distribution that is centered about the mean score value for the item and that has a standard deviation defined by the uncertainty value for that item; presenting items from the search results ordered in accord with the respective single scores produced for them.
12. The method of claim 11, comprising responding to selection of a presented item other than a first-most one of those items by adjusting one or more of the weighting factors.
13. The method of claim 12, the responding step including adjusting weighting factors of one or more characteristics associated with a selected item and with items presented before it.
14. The method of claim 12, comprising adjusting the weighting factors by pair-wise matching of the selected item and each of the items presented before it.
15. The method of claim 14, comprising adjusting the weighting factors by performing an inverse scoring calculation.
