INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEM, INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD, AND STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
Provided is an information processing system including: a demand estimation unit that estimates a demand amount based on a plurality of factors; and a display information generation unit that generates display information that causes a display device to display information related to an influence degree that at least one factor of the plurality of factors causes on the demand amount.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An information processing system comprising: a demand estimation unit that estimates a demand amount based on a plurality of factors; and a display information generation unit that generates display information that causes a display device to display information related to an influence degree that at least one factor of the plurality of factors causes on the demand amount.
2. The information processing system according to claim 1, wherein the display information to be displayed on the display device includes an item name of at least one factor of the plurality of factors and the influence degree corresponding to each of the at least one factor.
3. The information processing system according to claim 1, wherein the display information to be displayed on the display device includes an item name of at least one factor of the plurality of factors and information related to an increase or decrease of the demand amount due to each of the at least one factor.
4. The information processing system according to claim 3, wherein the item name of at least one factor of the plurality of factors and the information related to an increase or decrease of the demand amount due to each of the at least one factor are displayed in descending order of an amount of an increase or decrease in the demand amount.
5. The information processing system according to claim 1, wherein the display information to be displayed on the display device includes information indicating a specific content of at least one factor of the plurality of factors.
6. The information processing system according to claim 1, wherein the display information to be displayed on the display device includes information indicating an achievement value of the demand amount in the past earlier than an estimation target time of the demand amount.
7. The information processing system according to claim 6, wherein the achievement value is selected from a past achievement value in which a relationship between the plurality of factors and the influence degree is similar to that at the estimation target time.
8. The information processing system according to claim 1, wherein the demand estimation unit calculates the demand amount by using an estimation model including classification by a decision tree and regression formulas corresponding to respective results of the classification.
9. The information processing system according to claim 1, wherein the display information to be displayed on the display device includes information indicating a value of the demand amount estimated by the demand estimation unit.
10. The information processing system according to claim 1, wherein the display information to be displayed on the display device includes a user interface that accepts input of an order amount.
11. The information processing system according to claim 1, wherein the display information to be displayed on the display device includes a recommended order amount calculated based on the demand amount estimated by the demand amount estimation unit and a stock amount.
12. The information processing system according to claim 11, wherein the recommended order amount is displayed on a user interface that accepts input of an order amount.
13. An information processing method comprising: estimating a demand amount based on a plurality of factors; and generating display information that causes a display device to display information related to an influence degree that at least one factor of the plurality of factors causes on the demand amount.
14. A non-transitory storage medium storing an information processing program that causes a computer to perform: estimating a demand amount based on a plurality of factors; and generating display information that causes a display device to display information related to an influence degree that at least one factor of the plurality of factors causes on the demand amount.
