PATIENT MOTION TRACKING SYSTEM CONFIGURED FOR AUTOMATIC ROI GENERATION
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to a patient motion tracking system for automatic generation of a region of interest on a 3D surface of a patient positioned in a radiotherapy treatment room. More particularly, the disclosure relates to an assistive approach of a motion tracking system, by which a region of interest (ROI) is automatically generated on a generated 3D surface of the patient. Furthermore, a method for automatically generating a ROI on the 3D surface of the patient is described. In particular, all the embodiments refer to systems integrating methods for automatic ROI generation in a radiotherapy treatment setup.

<claims>
1. A patient motion tracking system for automatic generation of a region of interest on a 3D surface of a patient positioned in a radiotherapy treatment room, the system comprising: a memory comprising stored region of interest (ROI) descriptive data; a 3D surface generation processor configured to utilize an input surface, and generate a 3D surface from said input surface, wherein the 3D surface comprises at least a target area of the input surface; a ROI generation processor configured to utilize said stored ROI descriptive data and said 3D surface to output a ROI labelled 3D surface to a display and a motion tracking module, wherein said ROI labelled 3D surface is utilized by the motion tracking module to track motion of patient during positioning and/or treatment of said patient in the treatment room.
2. System according to claim 1, wherein the system comprises a 3D scanning reconstruction system configured to be arranged in the radiotherapy treatment room and configured to generate said input surface.
3. System according to claim 1, wherein the input surface is configured as a series of 2D image frames of at least said target area of said patient and said 3D surface generation processor is configured to generate from said 2D image frames said 3D surface.
4. System according to claim 3, wherein the system furthermore comprises one or more cameras configured to be arranged in the radiotherapy treatment room and to obtain said series of 2D image frames of at least the target area of the patient.
5. System according to any one of the previous claims, wherein the stored ROI descriptive data comprises one or more reference surfaces each having an annotated reference ROI applied thereto.
6. System according to claim 5, wherein the annotated reference ROI is based on the identification of one or more landmarks applied to each of reference surfaces, wherein the landmarks represent uniquely identifiable portions of the reference target area surface.
7. System according to any one of the previous claims, wherein said ROI labelled 3D surface is configured to be input to said display unit, wherein said display unit is configured to allow said user to adjust said region of interest via control inputs to the ROI generation processor, wherein the control inputs utilizes an adjustment of at least the borders of the ROI label of the ROI labelled 3D surface.
8. System according to claim 8, wherein said ROI labelled 3D surface is read into a quality module of said system, wherein said quality module is configured to estimate one or more geometric measurements of the 3D data in said ROI labelled 3D surface and to compare said estimated geometric measurements with one or more set thresholds.
9. System according to any one of the previous claims, wherein the ROI descriptive data comprises
a template surface and
a template ROI,
wherein said template surface and template ROI are input to said ROI generation processor, which is configured to
align and warp said template ROI and template surface with the 3D surface to create at least a warped ROI, and
subsequently to transfer said warped ROI to said 3D surface.
10. System according to claim 9, wherein the system furthermore comprises a training module configured to generate and output to said memory, the template surface and the template ROI.
11. System according to claim 10 wherein said training module comprises two or more reference target surfaces each having an annotated reference ROI applied thereto, wherein the training module is configured to
align the two or more reference surfaces and subsequently to calculate an average of said aligned reference surfaces to produce said template surface, and
calculate an average of said annotated ROIs to produce said template ROI.
12. System according to any one of claims 5 to 8, wherein the ROI descriptive data is configured as a ROI model, which ROI model is trained in a machine learning processor prior to being stored in said memory, wherein the ROI model is trained on the basis of said one or more reference target surfaces each having an annotated reference ROI applied thereto.
13. System according to claim 12, wherein the ROI generation processor is configured to utilize the 3D surface as input to said ROI model, and to output said ROI labelled 3D surface to said display and/or said motion tracking module.
14. System according to any of claims 12 to 13, wherein said reference surfaces are configured as depth map and normal map representations of the reference surfaces, and wherein the ROI model is configured to utilize the 3D surface and to classify in said depth map and normal map representations, vertices as being inside or outside of the region of interest as defined by the trained model.
15. System according to claim 5, wherein said ROI generation processor furthermore comprises a landmark generation model, wherein said landmark generation module is trained in a machine learning processor prior to being stored in said ROI generation processor, wherein the landmark generation model is trained on the basis of said one or more reference target surfaces each having annotated landmarks applied thereto.
16. System according to claim 15, wherein the landmark generation model outputs a representation of landmarks onto the input surface, thereby creating a landmark labelled 3D surface, wherein the landmark labelled 3D surface is utilized in said ROI generation processor together with a template surface and a template ROI to
align and warp said template ROI and template surface with the landmark labelled 3D surface to create an aligned and warped ROI, and
subsequently to transfer said warped ROI to said 3D surface to output the ROI labelled 3D surface.
