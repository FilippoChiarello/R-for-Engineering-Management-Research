<title>
System and method for picking validation
</title>

<abstract>
A system and a method for validating items gathered (i.e., picked) as part of a logistics process are disclosed. The picking system uses one or more sensors to sense the physical attributes of an item (e.g., weight, color, size/shape, etc.). The sensed-physical attributes are compared to expected-physical attributes stored for the item. Based on the comparison, a user may receive feedback confirming or rejecting the picked item. In some embodiments, the picking system uses the collected physical data to improve, or add to, the expected-physical attributes. The picking system may also be integrated with a powered-industrial vehicle and/or a warehouse management system to improve usability and effectiveness.
