SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR CAPTURING AND INTERPRETING AUDIO
</title>

<abstract>
A device is provided for capturing vibrations produced by an object such as a musical instrument such as a cymbal of a drum kit. The device comprises a detectable element, such as a ferromagnetic element, such as a metal shim and a sensor spaced apart from and located relative to the musical instrument. The detectable element is located between the sensor and the musical instrument. When the musical instrument vibrates, the sensor remains stationary and the detectable element is vibrated relative to the sensor by the musical instrument.

<claims>
1. A device for capturing vibrations produced by an object, the device comprising: a detectable element located relative to the object; a sensor spaced apart from the object and located relative to the object; wherein the detectable element is located between the sensor and the object, and wherein when the object vibrates, the sensor remains stationary and the detectable element is vibrated relative to the sensor by the object.
2. The device of claim 1 wherein the object is a musical instrument.
3. The device of claim 2 wherein the object is a cymbal, and wherein the device is a cymbal clamp.
4. The device of claim 3 wherein the detectable element is a ferromagnetic shim, and wherein the sensor is an inductive coil, and wherein the device further comprises a magnet fixed adjacent the inductive coil such that the inductive coil and the magnet remain stationary when the object vibrates.
5. The device of claim 4 wherein the ferromagnetic shim is spaced apart from the cymbal by a first pad or portion of a pad, and wherein the ferromagnetic shim is spaced apart from the sensor by a second pad or portion of a pad, such that the vibration of the ferromagnetic shim is proportional to the vibration of the cymbal.
6. The device of claim 5, wherein the first pad or portion of a pad and the second pad or portion of a pad comprise felt and the ferromagnetic shim is a metal shim.
7. A cymbal clamp comprising: a cymbal clamping location between an upper pad and a lower pad; a sensor module spaced apart from the cymbal clamping location by one of the upper pad and the lower pad; a detectable element located between the cymbal clamping location and the sensor module; wherein the sensor module is stationary relative to a cymbal mounting location and the detectable element moves relative to the sensor module upon generation of an audio event at a cymbal at the cymbal clamping location.
8. The cymbal clamp of claim 7, wherein the detectable element is embedded in the upper pad or the lower pad.
9. The cymbal clamp of claim 7, wherein the one of the upper pad and the lower pad between the cymbal clamping location and the sensor module comprises a first pad portion and a second pad portion, and wherein the detectable element is located between the first pad portion and the second pad portion.
10. The cymbal clamp of claim 7, wherein the detectable element is ferromagnetic.
11. The cymbal clamp of claim 10, wherein the detectable element is a metal shim.
12. The cymbal clamp of claim 11, wherein the sensor module comprises: a housing; an inductive coil; and a magnet fixed adjacent the inductive coil such that it biases the coil, and wherein vibration of the metal shim generates an electromagnetic disturbance detectable by the inductive coil.
13. The cymbal clamp of claim 12, wherein upon generation of the audio event, the shim vibrates at a frequency directly related to a vibration frequency of the cymbal.
14. The cymbal clamp of claim 7 further comprising a processor for identifying an audio event based on vibrations detected at the sensor module.
15. The cymbal clamp of claim 14 further comprising an audio output for outputting a sound based on the audio event identified by the processor.
16. The cymbal clamp of claim 7, wherein each of the upper pad and the lower pad are felt pads.
17. A cymbal stand comprising: a cymbal clamping location between an upper pad and a lower pad; a sensor module spaced apart from the cymbal clamping location by one of the upper pad and the lower pad; a detectable element located between the cymbal clamping location and the sensor module; wherein the sensor module is stationary relative to the cymbal stand and the detectable element moves relative to the sensor module upon generation of an audio event at a cymbal at the cymbal clamping location.
18. The cymbal stand of claim 17, wherein the one of the upper pad and the lower pad between the cymbal clamping location and the sensor module comprises a first pad portion and a second pad portion, and wherein the detectable element is a ferromagnetic shim located between the first pad portion and the second pad portion.
19. The cymbal stand of claim 18, wherein the sensor module comprises: a housing; an inductive coil; and a magnet located adjacent the inductive coil such that it biases the coil, and wherein vibration of the ferromagnetic shim generates an electromagnetic disturbance detectable by the inductive coil.
20. The cymbal stand of claim 19, wherein upon generation of the audio event, the ferromagnetic shim vibrates at a frequency directly related to a vibration frequency of the cymbal.
21. The cymbal stand of claim 17 further comprising a processor for identifying an audio event based on vibrations detected at the sensor module.
22. The cymbal stand of claim 21 further comprising an audio output for outputting a sound based on the audio event identified by the processor.
