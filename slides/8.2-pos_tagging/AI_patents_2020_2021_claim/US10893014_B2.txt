Information processing apparatus, information processing method, and non-transitory computer readable medium
</title>

<abstract>
An information processing apparatus includes an acquisition unit, a notification unit, and a controller. The acquisition unit acquires input information including (i) information on a user and (ii) information that the user conveys to an interaction partner. The notification unit notifies information. The controller causes the notification unit to notify output information corresponding to (a) response information, to the input information, from the interaction partner and (b) the notification unit.

<claims>
1. An information processing apparatus comprising: a controller configured to function as a plurality of programmed units comprising an acquisition unit configured to acquire input information including (i) information on a user and (ii) information that the user conveys to an interaction partner, wherein the controller is configured to generate response information corresponding to the input information and to control transmission of the response information and the input information to an external device, wherein the response information comprises moving image data, the external device is a computer connected to a display, and the computer reproduces the moving image data on the display, wherein the interaction partner comprising an automatic response artificial intelligence (AI), and the response information further corresponding to characteristics and condition of the user, wherein in condition where the external device cannot edit the moving image data to be compatible with an information conveyance medium of the external device, the interaction partner notifies the user using another information conveyance medium of the external device suitable for notifying the response information.
2. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the controller edits personal information of the user included in the input information into information based on which the user is not identified to control the transmission of the input information.
3. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the acquisition unit acquires the personal information of the user as the information on the user from a device carried by the user.
4. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the controller generates an output information by editing the response information in further accordance with the information that the user conveys to the interaction partner.
5. The information processing apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the acquisition unit acquires personal information of the user as the information on the user from a device carried by the user.
6. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the acquisition unit acquires personal information of the user as the information on the user from a device carried by the user.
7. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the acquisition unit acquires personal information of the user as the information on the user from a device carried by the user.
8. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the acquisition unit acquires personal information of the user as the information on the user from a device carried by the user.
9. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the acquisition unit acquires personal information of the user as the information on the user from a device carried by the user.
10. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the acquisition unit acquires personal information of the user as the information on the user from a device carried by the user.
11. An information processing method comprising: acquiring input information including (i) information on a user and (ii) information that the user conveys to an interaction partner; generating response information corresponding to the input information, wherein the response information comprises moving image data; transmitting the response information and the input information to an external device by a controller, wherein the external device is a computer connected to a display; and reproducing the moving image data on the display by the computer, wherein the interaction partner comprising an automatic response artificial intelligence (AI), and the response information further corresponding to characteristics and condition of the user, wherein in condition where the external device cannot edit the moving image data to be compatible with an information conveyance medium of the external device, the interaction partner notifies the user using another information conveyance medium of the external device suitable for notifying the response information.
12. A non-transitory computer readable medium storing a program that causes a computer to execute information processing, the information processing comprising: acquiring input information including (i) information on a user and (ii) information that the user conveys to an interaction partner; generating response information corresponding to the input information, wherein the response information comprises moving image data, transmitting the response information and the input information to an external device by a controller, wherein the external device is a computer connected to a display; and reproducing the moving image data on the display by the computer, wherein the interaction partner comprising an automatic response artificial intelligence (AI), and the response information further corresponding to characteristics and condition of the user, wherein in condition where the external device cannot edit the moving image data to be compatible with an information conveyance medium of the external device, the interaction partner notifies the user using another information conveyance medium of the external device suitable for notifying the response information.
