<title>
System and method for adding surface detail to digital crown models created using statistical techniques
</title>

<abstract>
Generating a crown model using a statistical method (such as k-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), or similar statistical methods) can result in a crown model that is missing sharpness details below the threshold of the statistical technique. A method is provided to add back the sharpness to the resulting model by combining a single full-featured example into the algorithms generating the statistical model. The end result is a crown model that is relatively simple to produce and manipulate in real time, yet maintains the anatomical sharpness of a natural tooth.

<claims>
1. A method for creating a tooth model using a statistical technique such that the created tooth model is modified in a way that maintains a natural tooth shape, comprising: obtaining data representing a set of sample teeth by scanning samples of a single tooth type into a 3D format; for each set of single tooth type scanned samples, determining a set of common points across all single teeth in the samples; performing a statistical analysis of the data in the set of sample teeth using the set of common points to create an average statistical model of each tooth position; the statistical analysis is performed using a k-means clustering algorithm or a principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm; replacing the average statistical model of a tooth position with a tooth sample having surface details for the single tooth type; and performing a statistical combination of at least a portion of the tooth sample having surface details and structures of the average statistical model of the tooth position for a tooth top of interest, the method further including: deforming said tooth sample to match the average statistical model of the tooth position; determining a sharpness level for use on the deformed tooth sample wherein said sharpness level is between 0% and 100%; computing a deviation vector by subtracting the average statistical model of the tooth position from the deformed tooth sample, multiplied by a sharpness factor, wherein said sharpness factor is the sharpness level/100; and adding the deviation vector to the average statistical model of the tooth position when the statistical analysis is performed using the PCA algorithm or to cluster averages when the statistical analysis is performed using the k-means clustering algorithm, in order to create the tooth model.
2. The method as in claim 1, further comprising using the average statistical model of the tooth position for the tooth top of interest to create a deformable tooth model for use in visualizing restorative dental anatomy during a creation of a patient specific dental restoration.
3. The method as in claim 1, further comprising using the average statistical model of the tooth position for the tooth top of interest to create a deformable tooth model for use in creating a physical patient-specific dental restoration.
4. The method as in claim 1, comprising performing interactive crown design using said statistical combination of at least the portion of the tooth sample having surface details and structures of the average statistical model of the tooth position for the tooth top of interest.
5. The method as in claim 4, wherein the statistical combination is satisfied for when the statistical analysis is performed using the PCA algorithm by a weighted combination of principal components.
6. The method as in claim 4, wherein the statistical combination is satisfied for when the statistical analysis is performed using the k-means clustering algorithm by a weighted linear combination of cluster averages.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein determining the set of common points across all single teeth in the samples comprises computing point-to-point correspondence between respective teeth in the samples using a harmonic map.
