</title>

<abstract>
A control method for controlling a spring loaded brake actuator (9) comprising a first chamber (Ch1) to receive a parking brake pressure (PBR) acting against a main spring (92), and a second chamber (Ch2) to receive a service brake pressure (SB) for applying a service brake force, the method comprising a circumstantial selection of one control law among a set of control laws comprising two or more compound control laws : -where the first compound control law (CL1), known as anti-compound mode, is such the service brake pressure (SB) is electronically controlled such that the resulting total braking force (F) does not exceed a first upper limit (UL1) corresponding to the force of the main spring (92) when the parking brake pressure (PBR) is substantially null, -where the second compound control law (CL2), known as controlled-compound mode, is such that the service brake pressure (SB) is electronically controlled such that the resulting total braking force (F) does not exceed a second upper limit (UL2) higher than the first upper limit.

- where the first compound control law (CL1), known as anti-compound mode, is such that at least the service brake pressure (SB) is electronically controlled such that the resulting total braking force (F) does not exceed a first upper limit (UL1) corresponding to the force of the main spring (92) when the parking brake pressure (PBR) is substantially null,

2. The control method according to claim 1, further comprising a first border compound control law (BCL1) for a transition from a park brake released state to a park brake applied state or for a transition from a park brake applied state to a park brake released state, where the parking brake pressure (PBR) and the service brake pressure (SB) are balanced such that the total braking force (F) equals the first upper limit (UL1) corresponding to the force of the main spring (92) when the parking brake pressure (PBR) is substantially null.
3.
