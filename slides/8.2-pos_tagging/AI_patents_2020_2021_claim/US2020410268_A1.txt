<title>
FAKE FINGER DETECTION BASED ON TRANSIENT FEATURES
</title>

<abstract>
In a method for determining whether a finger is a real finger at an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, a sequence of images of a fingerprint of a finger are captured at an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, wherein the sequence of images includes images captured during a change in contact state between the finger and the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. A plurality of transient features of the finger is extracted from the sequence of images. A classifier is applied to the plurality of transient features to classify the finger as one of a real finger and a fake finger. It is determined whether the finger is a real finger based on an output of the classifier.
