Method for selecting network providing restricted local operator service in wireless communication system and apparatus thereof
</title>

<abstract>
A method for selecting, by a user equipment (UE), a public land mobile network (PLMN) in a wireless communication system is disclosed. The method includes attempting a registration on a PLMN selected by a user in a manual network selection mode, if the registration on the PLMN selected by the user cannot be achieved, finding one or more PLMNs offering access to restricted local operator service (RLOS), selecting a specific PLMN of the found one or more PLMNs among PLMNs contained in a RLOS PLMN list configured to a universal subscriber identity module (USIM) of the UE, and initiating a registration for an access to RLOS on the specific PLMN, thereby using RLOS with high quality and high security.

<claims>
1. A method for selecting, by a user equipment (UE), a public land mobile network (PLMN) in a wireless communication system, the method comprising: performing a registration on a PLMN selected by a user in a manual network selection mode; detecting one or more PLMNs offering access to restricted local operator service (RLOS), wherein the detected one or more PLMNs include: at least one first PLMN in a RLOS PLMN list within a universal subscriber identity module (USIM) of the UE, and at least one second PLMN that is not contained in the RLOS PLMN list, but offers the RLOS; and initiating a registration for an access to RLOS on any PLMN of the detected one or more PLMNs based on (i) that the registration on the PLMN selected by the user is not successfully achieved and (ii) that the one or more PLMNs offering access to the RLOS are detected.
2. The method of claim 1, based on that the registration for the access to the RLOS on the any PLMN cannot be achieved, selecting another PLMN capable of offering the RLOS among the detected one or more PLMNs; and performing a registration for an access to a RLOS on the another PLMN.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the USIM of the UE includes information related to a radio access technology (RAT) allowed in each PLMN contained in the RLOS PLMN list.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: excluding the at least first PLMN in the RLOS PLMN list from the detected one or more PLMNs; and selecting the any PLMN, based on information related to whether to initiate a registration procedure for an access to a RLOS, from the at least one second PLMN remained after excluding the at least first PLMN.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the any PLMN is selected, based on information related to whether to initiate a registration procedure for an access to a RLOS, among the detected one or more PLMNs.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the any PLMN is selected, based on information related to whether to initiate a registration procedure for an access to a RLOS, among the at least one first PLMN in the detected one or more PLMNs.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: after initiating the registration for the access to the RLOS on the any PLMN, initiating a registration for an access to a RLOS on a remaining PLMN excluding the any PLMN.
8. The method of any one of claim 1, further comprising: detecting a plurality of PLMNs offering access to an internet service; and determining whether each of the detected plurality of PLMNs supports the RLOS.
9. A user equipment (UE) configured to select a public land mobile network (PLMN) in a wireless communication system, the UE comprising: a communication module; at least one processor; and at least one computer memory operably connected to the at least one processor and storing instructions that, based on being executed by the at least one processor, perform operations including: performing a registration on a PLMN selected by a user in a manual network selection mode; detecting one or more PLMNs offering access to a restricted local operator service (RLOS), wherein the detected one or more PLMNs include: at least one first PLMN in a RLOS PLMN list within a universal subscriber identity module (USIM) of the UE, and at least one second PLMN that is not contained in the RLOS PLMN list, but offers the RLOS; and initiating a registration for an access to RLOS on any PLMN of the detected one or more PLMNs among PLMNs based on (i) that the registration on the PLMN selected by the user is not successfully achieved and (ii) that the one or more PLMNs offering access to the RLOS are detected.
10. The UE of claim 9, wherein the operations further comprise: based on that the registration for the access to the RLOS on the first PLMN cannot be achieved, selecting another PLMN capable of offering the RLOS among the detected one or more PLMNs; and performing a registration for an access to a RLOS on the another PLMN.
11. The UE of claim 9, wherein the USIM of the UE includes information related to a radio access technology (RAT) allowed in each PLMN contained in the RLOS PLMN list.
12. The UE of claim 9, wherein the operations further comprise: excluding the at least first PLMN in the RLOS PLMN list from the detected one or more PLMNs; and selecting the any PLMN, based on information related to whether to initiate a registration procedure for an access to a RLOS, from the at least one second PLMN remained after excluding the at least first PLMN.
13. The UE of claim 9, wherein the any PLMN is selected, based on information related to whether to initiate a registration procedure for an access to a RLOS, among the detected one or more PLMNs.
14. The UE of claim 9, wherein the any PLMN is selected, based on information related to whether to initiate a registration procedure for an access to a RLOS, among the at least one first PLMN in the detected one or more PLMNs.
15. A method for selecting, by a user equipment (UE), a public land mobile network (PLMN) in a wireless communication system, the method comprising: detecting one or more PLMNs offering access to restricted local operator service (RLOS); selecting a first PLMN offering RLOS among the detected one or more PLMNs based on a RLOS PLMN list configured in the UE; indicating the selected first PLMN, wherein the UE is configured with information related to a priority order between PLMNs contained in the RLOS PLMN list; and initiating a registration for an access to RLOS on the detected one or more PLMNs based on the information related to the priority order between the PLMNs.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the priority order between the PLMNs is configured based on an order described in the RLOS PLMN list.
