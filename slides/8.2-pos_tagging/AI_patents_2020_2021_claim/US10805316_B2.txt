<title>
Systems and methods for detecting attacks in big data systems
</title>

<abstract>
Various examples of methods and systems are provided for an attack detection system that can detect attacks in big data systems. The attack detection system can include security modules coupled to data nodes of the big data system. The attack detection system can identify a process executing on the respective data node. A process signature can be generated for the process executing on the data node. A determination of whether a big data system is being attacked can be based at least in part on a comparison of the process signature with at least one other process signature for the same process executing on another security module. The other process signatures are received via secure communication from the other security module.
