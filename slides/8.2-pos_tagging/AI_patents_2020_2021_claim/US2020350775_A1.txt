Methods and Systems for Automatic Electric Vehicle Identification and Charging Via Wireless Charging Pads
</title>

<abstract>
A system for charging a battery of a vehicle using inductive charging is provided. The system includes a charging pad for inductive charge transfer. The charge pad is configured with electronics that enables wireless communication. A self-aligning mechanism is part of the charging pad, and the self-aligning mechanism is configured to adjust positioning of the charging pad when the vehicle is disposed over the charging pad. A computer associated with the charging pad is configured to execute method operations for communicating with electronics of the vehicle to enable charging of the battery of the vehicle. The electronics of the vehicle is configured to identify a user account for charging the vehicle. An application associated with the user account is configured to receive updates regarding a charging status of the vehicle responsive to said inductive charge transfer being enabled. The computer associated with the charging pad is configured to detect when said vehicle is moved off from over the charging pad to discontinue said inductive charge transfer. The application associated with the user account is configured to identify an amount of charge on the battery of the vehicle and update the charging status to indicate no charging of said battery when the vehicle is no longer over the charging pad.

<claims>
1. A system for charging a battery of a vehicle using inductive charging, comprising, a charging pad for inductive charge transfer, the charge pad is configured with electronics that enables wireless communication; a self-aligning mechanism being part of the charging pad, the self-aligning mechanism is configured to adjust positioning of the charging pad when the vehicle is disposed over the charging pad; and a computer associated with the charging pad, the computer is configured to execute method operations for communicating with electronics of the vehicle to enable charging of the battery of the vehicle, the electronics of the vehicle is configured to identify a user account for charging the vehicle, an application associated with the user account is configured to receive updates regarding a charging status of the vehicle responsive to said inductive charge transfer being enabled; wherein the computer associated with the charging pad is configured to detect when said vehicle is moved off from over the charging pad to discontinue said inductive charge transfer, wherein the application associated with the user account is configured to identify an amount of charge on the battery of the vehicle and update the charging status to indicate no charging of said battery when the vehicle is no longer over the charging pad.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein said identifying of the user account for charging the vehicle, when the vehicle is present over the charging pad, is performed automatically without user input.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein said discontinuing of said inductive charge transfer occurs automatically without user input.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the charging pad is a private charging pad or a public charging pad.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the computer is configured to communicate with a cloud system, the cloud system is configured to identify the user account to enable said inductive charge transfer automatically start and end when the vehicle is identified to be over one or more other charge pads.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein said identifying the user account and enabling said inductive charge transfer is processed automatically without user input, and said enabling includes processing by the computer a signal from the vehicle, the signal includes information indicative that a conductor of the vehicle is disposed over the charge pad to enable said inductive transfer of power to said battery of the vehicle from a power supply connected to the charging pad.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the computer is configured to communicate with a cloud system includes one or more servers for communicating with said charging pad or one or more other charging pads associated with a service managed by the cloud system.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein cloud system has access to part of the user account for pre-authorizing payment for charge when the charging pad is a public charging pad.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the charging pad is configured for said inductive charge transfer of power via inductors disposed on an underside of the vehicle and inductors associated with the charging pad.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the vehicle includes a display that identifies information indicative of said vehicle being disposed over the charging pad.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein a portable device is configured to communicate with the computer of the charging pad to obtain said status of charging, and said application is at least in part accessed via the portable device.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein the inductive charge transfer of power is enabled by inductive coupling between a conductive plate disposed in an undersurface of the vehicle, the conductive plate being oriented over the charging pad to enable said inductive coupling, the inductive coupling being optimized when the conductive plate is more aligned than not using the self-aligning mechanism of the charging pad.
13. The system of claim 1, wherein the user account includes a setting for a personal level of privacy, the personal level of privacy sets limits on tracking of the vehicle.
