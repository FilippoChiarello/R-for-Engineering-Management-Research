USING DEEP LEARNING BASED DEFECT DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES FOR PIXEL LEVEL IMAGE QUANTIFICATION
</title>

<abstract>
A heat map of probable defects in an image can be represented as a matrix of defect probability index corresponding to each pixel. The image may be generated from data received from a detector of a scanning electron microscope or other inspection tools. A number of pixels in the image that exceed a corresponding threshold in the matrix can be quantified.
