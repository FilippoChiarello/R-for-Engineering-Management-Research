RESPIRATOR FITTING DEVICE AND METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for automated respirator fit testing by comparing three-dimensional (3D) images are disclosed. An example embodiment is configured to: obtain at least one three-dimensional facial image of an individual at an initial visit (Visit X); capture at least one current 3D facial image of the individual at a subsequent visit (Visit X+n); convert the Visit X image and the Visit X+n image to numerical data for computation and analysis; identify reference points in the Visit X data and the Visit X+n data; determine if the Visit X data and the Visit X+n data is sufficiently aligned; determine if any differences between the VISIT X data and the VISIT X+n data are greater than a pre-defined set of Allowable Deltas (ADs); and record a pass status if the differences between the VISIT X data and the VISIT X+n data are not greater than the pre-defined ADs.
