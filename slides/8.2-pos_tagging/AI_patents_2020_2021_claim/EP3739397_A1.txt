METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PRODUCING A POLYMER PRODUCT WITHIN A HIGH-FREQUENCY PRODUCTION PLANT
</title>

<abstract>
A method for producing a polymer product in a production plant, preferably in a high-frequency production plant, wherein a system comprises a production plant, a server and a condition computer, wherein the server comprises a platform, a function engine and a value engine. The method comprises a first cycle in whicha) the platform sends production data to the function engine,b) the function engine uses the production data to determine a production function and sends the production function to the value engine,c) the condition computer sends a production condition to the value engine,d) the value engine uses the production function and the production condition to extract a production value from the production function,e) the value engine sends the production value to the production plant in order to produce the polymer product according to the production value.The steps of a) to e) are repeated after the first cycle and constitute a repeating cycle, wherein the production value of step d) of the first cycle serves as an additional input for the repeating cycle.
