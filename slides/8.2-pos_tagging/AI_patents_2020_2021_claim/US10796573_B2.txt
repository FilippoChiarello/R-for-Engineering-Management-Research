<title>
Crowd-based vehicular geofencing
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle includes a powertrain. The vehicle includes a controller configured to operate the powertrain according to the heading based speed limits such that, for a predefined region of a particular road, a maximum speed allowed by the heading based speed limits is less for headings toward a specified crowd density location than for headings away from the specified crowd density location. The powertrain operation is responsive to being within a crowd density defined geofence having heading based speed limits.

<claims>
1. A vehicle comprising: a powertrain; and a controller configured to, responsive to being within a crowd density defined geofence having heading based speed limits, operate the powertrain according to the heading based speed limits such that, for a predefined region of a particular road, a maximum speed allowed by the heading based speed limits is less for headings toward a specified crowd density location than for headings away from the specified crowd density location, wherein the maximum speed allowed by the heading based speed limits is less for headings centripetal to a centroid of the geofence than for headings orbiting the centroid.
2. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the maximum speed allowed by the heading based speed limits is less for distances closer to the location than for distances farther from the location.
3. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the geofence is defined by the crowd density being above a crowd density threshold.
4. The vehicle of claim 3, wherein the crowd density threshold is based on an average attendee density of sectors within the geofence.
5. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the crowd density is based on mobile device location data.
6. A vehicle comprising: a powertrain; and a controller configured to, responsive to being within a crowd density defined geofence having heading based speed limits, operate the powertrain according to the heading based speed limits such that, for a predefined region of a particular road, a maximum speed allowed by the heading based speed limits is less for distances closer to the location than for distances farther from the location, wherein the maximum speed allowed by the heading based speed limits is less for headings centripetal to a centroid of the geofence than for headings orbiting the centroid.
7. The vehicle of claim 6, wherein the maximum speed allowed by the heading based speed limits is less for headings toward a specified crowd density location than for headings away from the specified crowd density location.
8. The vehicle of claim 6, wherein the geofence defined by the crowd density being above a crowd density threshold.
9. The vehicle of claim 8, wherein the crowd density threshold is based on an average attendee density of sectors within the geofence.
10. The vehicle of claim 6, wherein the crowd density is based on mobile device location data.
11. A vehicle method comprising: responsive to being within a crowd density defined geofence having heading based speed limits, operating by a controller a powertrain according to the heading based speed limits such that, for a predefined region of a particular road, a maximum speed allowed by the heading based speed limits is less for headings toward a specified crowd density location than for headings away from the specified crowd density location, wherein the maximum speed allowed by the heading based speed limits is less for headings centripetal to a centroid of the geofence than for headings orbiting the centroid.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the maximum speed allowed by the heading based speed limits is less for distances closer to the location than for distances farther from the location.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the geofence is defined by the crowd density being above a crowd density threshold.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the crowd density threshold is based on an average attendee density of sectors within the geofence.
