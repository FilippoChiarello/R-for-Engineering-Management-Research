METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING DATA UNITS WHEN RADIO LINK PROBLEM OCCURS BY RELAY NODE IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND APPARATUS THEREFOR
</title>

<abstract>
A method for transmitting data units by a relay node configured with a first radio link control (RLC) entity and a second RLC entity in a wireless communication system is disclosed. Especially, the first RLC entity is active and the second RLC entity is inactive. The method comprises transmitting data units on the first radio link using a first RLC entity to a first node; activating the second RLC entity when a radio link problem occurs on the first radio link; and transmitting at least one data unit of the data units on the second radio link using the second RLC entity to a second node, wherein the at least one data unit is a data unit which is not successfully transmitted on the first radio link before the radio link problem occurs on the first radio link.

<claims>
1. A method for transmitting data units by a relay node configured with a first radio link control (RLC) entity and a second RLC entity in a wireless communication system, wherein the first RLC entity is active and the second RLC entity is inactive, the method comprising: transmitting data units on the first radio link using a first RLC entity to a first node; activating the second RLC entity when a radio link problem occurs on the first radio link; and transmitting at least one data unit of the data units on the second radio link using the second RLC entity to a second node; wherein the at least one data unit is a data unit which is not successfully transmitted on the first radio link before the radio link problem occurs on the first radio link.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the data units are submitted to each of the first RLC entity and the second RLC entity from an upper layer.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein one or more data units, which are transmitted successfully to the first node, are discarded by the second RLC entity.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the second RLC entity performs sequence number (SN) re-association to the data units excluding the discarded data units.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein information related to the one or more data units is provided from the first RLC entity to the second RLC entity via the upper layer.
6. A relay node configured with a first radio link control (RLC) entity and a second RLC entity in a wireless communication system, wherein the first RLC entity is active and the second RLC entity is inactive, the relay node comprising: at least one transceiver; at least one processor; and at least one computer memory operably connectable to the at least one processor and storing instructions that, when executed, cause the at least one processor to perform operations comprising: transmitting data units on the first radio link using a first RLC entity to a first node; activating the second RLC entity when a radio link problem occurs on the first radio link; and transmitting at least one data unit of the data units on the second radio link using the second RLC entity to a second node, wherein the at least one data unit is a data unit which is not successfully transmitted on the first radio link before the radio link problem occurs on the first radio link.
7. The relay node of claim 6, wherein the data units are submitted to each of the first RLC entity and the second RLC entity from an upper layer.
8. The relay node of claim 7, wherein one or more data units, which are transmitted successfully to the first node, are discarded by the second RLC entity.
9. The relay node of claim 8, wherein the second RLC entity performs sequence number (SN) re-association to the data units excluding the discarded data units.
10. The relay node of claim 8, wherein information related to the one or more data units is provided from the first RLC entity to the second RLC entity via the upper layer.
