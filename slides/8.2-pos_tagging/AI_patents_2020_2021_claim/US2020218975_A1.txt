</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a technique for transforming a confusion network to a representation that can be used as an input for machine learning. A confusion network distributed representation sequence generating part that generates a confusion network distributed representation sequence, which is a vector sequence, from an arc word set sequence and an arc weight set sequence constituting the confusion network is included. The confusion network distributed representation sequence generating part comprises: an arc word distributed representation set sequence transforming part that, by transforming an arc word included in the arc word set to a word distributed representation, obtains an arc word distributed representation set and generates an arc word distributed representation set sequence; and an arc word distributed representation set weighting/integrating part that generates the confusion network distributed representation sequence from the arc word distributed representation set sequence and the arc weight set sequence.
