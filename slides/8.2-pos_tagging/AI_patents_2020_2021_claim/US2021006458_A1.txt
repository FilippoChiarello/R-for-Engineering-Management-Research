EDGE OR FOG GATEWAY ASSISTED OUT-OF-BAND REMOTE MANAGEMENT FOR MANAGED CLIENT DEVICES
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments herein relate to out-of-band connections for remote diagnosis and repair of client devices. In various embodiments, a server for remote management of a client device may receive, a network packet including a request for a keyboard-video-mouse (KVM) remote management session that includes an identifier of a gateway device coupled to a local area network (LAN) of the client device to be remotely managed by the server. The server may use the identifier of the gateway device to assist in invoking an out-of-band (OOB) connection between the client device and the gateway device. Other embodiments may be described and/or claimed.

<claims>
1. A method for remote management of a client device, the method comprising: receiving, through a network port at a remote server device, a WAN network packet including a request for a keyboard-video-mouse (KVM) remote management session that includes an identifier of a gateway device coupled to a local area network (LAN) of the client device to be remotely managed by the remote server device; and using the identifier of the gateway device to assist in: invoking by a pairing module of the remote server device, an out-of-band (OOB) connection between the client device and the gateway device, where the client device sends and receives KVM data packets through a LAN connection to and from the gateway device to establish the KVM remote management session.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising invoking by the pairing module of the remote server device, a remote management console to initiate a peer-to-peer in-band KVM remote management session with the gateway device to provide the KVM data packets to perform diagnosis or repair of the client device.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising invoking by the remote server device a secure key exchange between a remote management console and the gateway device to allow the remote management console to intercept secure management network packets from a management controller of the client device via the gateway device.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the WAN network packet is a CIRA packet transmitted from the client device and wherein a management controller of the client device receives the identifier from the gateway device prior to transmitting the CIRA packet.
5. A system for establishing a remote management session of a client device, the system comprising: a management server device including: a processor; a memory coupled to the processor; and a network interface operatively coupled to the processor and the memory and including a management port through which to send or receive a network packet that includes a gateway identifier; and a gateway device communicatively coupled to the management server device and including a remote communications manager coupled to a local area network (LAN) port and a wide area network (WAN) port, and wherein the management server device uses the gateway identifier to identify the gateway device to invoke the client device to establish the remote management session through an out-of-band (OOB) LAN connection with the gateway device.
6. The system of claim 5, further comprising a remote management console communicatively coupled to the management server device and communicatively coupled to the gateway device through a WAN to provide keyboard-video-mouse (KVM) data packets to the gateway device for the remote management session.
7. The system of claim 5, further comprising the client device, wherein the client device includes a management controller to establish the remote management session with the remote communications manager of the gateway device.
9. The system of claim 5, wherein the gateway identifier includes at least one of an internet protocol (IP) address, port number, media access control (MAC) address, domain name, unique device identification (UDI) or uniform resource locator (URL) of the gateway device.
10. An apparatus for establishing a remote management session of a client device, the apparatus comprising: a processor; a memory coupled to the processor; and the processor operatively coupled to the memory to: receive, through a network port, a WAN network packet including a request for a keyboard-video-mouse (KVM) remote management session that includes an identifier of a gateway device coupled to a local area network (LAN) of the client device to be remotely managed by the apparatus serving as a remote server device; use the identifier of the gateway device to assist in invoking by a pairing module, an out-of-band (OOB) connection between the client device and the gateway device, where the client device sends and receives KVM data packets through a LAN connection to and from the gateway device to establish the KVM remote management session.
11. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the apparatus is to further invoke by the pairing module, a remote management console to initiate a peer-to-peer in-band KVM remote management session with the gateway device to provide the KVM data packets to perform diagnosis or repair of the client device.
12. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the apparatus is to further invoke a secure key exchange between a remote management console and the gateway device to allow the remote management console to intercept secure management network packets from a management controller of the client device via the gateway device.
13. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the WAN network packet is a CIRA packet transmitted from the client device and wherein a management controller of the client device receives the identifier from the gateway device prior to transmitting the CIRA packet.
14. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the gateway identifier includes at least one of an internet protocol (IP) address, port number, media access control (MAC) address, domain name, unique device identification (UDI) or uniform resource locator (URL) of the gateway device.
15. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the apparatus is further to inspect a failover capability field in the network packet and proceed with the locating and invoking of the gateway device after failover capability is determined.
