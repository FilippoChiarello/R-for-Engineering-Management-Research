<title>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING A DESIGN FOR A TECHNICAL SYSTEM OR PRODUCT
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a computer-implemented method and apparatus for generating a design for a technical system or a product. Depending on a set of first parameters (P1), specifying physical properties, and second parameters (P2), specifying perceptible properties of the technical system or product, a design is generated for the technical system or product. A performance indicator (KPI1) that evaluates a physical performance of the generated design is obtained. The generated design of the technical system or product is presented to a user and perception data (PD) in response to the presentation of the generated design are measured by means of a perception capturing unit (105) and a perception evaluation indicator (KPI2) is deduced from the measured perception data. An optimized design is determined by iteratively (S6) optimizing the performance indicator (KPI1) and/or the perception evaluation indicator (KPI2) by means of an optimization algorithm. The method and apparatus enable an autonomous closed design loop taking human perception into account.
