CUSTOMER-CONTENT MATCHING AND VICARIOUS FEEDBACK FOR FASHION COMMERCE
</title>

<abstract>
Customers shop for clothing items online for convenience and selection, to save time or because they dislike trying on such clothing items. However, such online customers often struggle to find clothing items that are right for them. How a clothing item looks, fits, and feels are all important factors when making a purchasing decision, but images of clothing items and reviews can be misleading, sizing is guesswork, reviews are hit or miss, and online customers cannot physically interact with clothing items at the online point of sale. Given this uncertainty, customers often make poor buying decisions. Returns of clothing items due to poor fit and product misunderstandings frustrate customers and cost the fashion industry billions of dollars each year. This disclosure describes an online web application, preferably used in connection with mobile devices, that aims to reduce returns and improve customer experience by combining the convenience of online shopping with information gained through physical try-ons. A customer views demonstration videos (or demonstration live-streams) of the clothing item hosted by a person (i.e., a "host") with body measurements similar to those of the customer. As the host tries on and discusses the clothing item, the customer vicariously obtains the information necessary or desirable to make informed purchasing decisions.
