BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING METHOD AND WEARABLE BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING DEVICE USING SAME
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are a blood glucose monitoring method and a PPG-based blood glucose monitoring device for same in which a reference sample is prepared by means of preparing a human body substitute dummy and reference blood from which blood glucose is removed and applying quasi-blood to the dummy, the signal amount of each wavelength band with respect to the reference sample to which the reference blood is applied is measured by means of a blood glucose monitoring device, reference signal amount data is obtained and provided as basic data, irradiation light of a plurality of light sources is radiated on a body part of a subject for blood glucose monitoring by means of the blood glucose monitoring device of the present invention, a light-receiving element receives reflected light and scattered light and thus the signal amount of each wavelength band is obtained, a differential signal amount for each wavelength band, which is a corresponding reference signal amount for each wavelength band comprised in the basic data subtracted from the signal amount for each wavelength band with respect to the body part of the subject for blood glucose monitoring, is obtained, and a blood glucose amount corresponding to the differential signal amount for each wavelength band is calculated by means of the correlation between the differential signal amount for each wavelength band and the blood glucose amount.
