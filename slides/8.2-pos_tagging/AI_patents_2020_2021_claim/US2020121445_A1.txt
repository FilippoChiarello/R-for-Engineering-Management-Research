MICROANCHORS FOR KNOTLESS TISSUE REPAIR
</title>

<abstract>
A knotless anchor for attachment of tissue to bone includes a rigid anchor body and a suture extending there from. The suture is hollow and includes a fixed limb portion secured to the rigid anchor body. A soft suture tunnel extends in a longitudinal direction through the fixed limb portion of the suture. A free suture limb is passed through the tissue, back to the anchor, and through the soft suture tunnel, thereby creating a closable suture loop around the tissue. Tension applied to the free suture limb closes the suture loop, and approximates the tissue to the anchor body. When the anchor is deployed in a bone hole, external features of the anchor body grip the walls of the bone hole and simultaneously compress the suture, thereby preventing tissue pull-out. Anchor assemblies and methods of tissue fixation are also disclosed.

<claims>
1. A method of anchoring a tissue to a bone of a human or an animal without tying a knot, the method comprising: passing a free suture limb of a length of suture through the tissue, the length of suture also having a fixed suture limb, secured to a rigid anchor body; drawing the free suture limb through a suture tunnel formed adjacent the fixed suture limb, the suture tunnel extending along an external surface of the rigid anchor body intermediate a proximal and distal end of the rigid anchor body, and thereby defining a closed suture loop around the tissue; inserting the anchor body into a bone hole, so as to concurrently compress a portion of the length of suture between an internal wall of the bone hole and an exterior feature of the anchor body thereby locking the closed suture loop so as to prevent tissue pull-out.
2. The method of claim 1 further comprising drawing the tissue towards the anchor body by pulling on the free suture limb.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein the tissue is drawn towards the anchor body by pulling on the free suture limb after the anchor body has been inserted into the bone hole.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein the fixed suture limb is secured to an exterior of the anchor body.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the fixed suture limb and suture tunnel are disposed along the anchor body and at a location along the anchor body that is axially coincident with each other.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein inserting the anchor body into the bone hole further comprises locking the anchor body within the bone hole with at least one bone locking feature selected from the group consisting of a barb, ridge, thread, and rib.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein the suture fixed limb is secured to the anchor body via bonding, ultrasonic welding, ultrasonic staking, heat staking, ultrasonic molding, or injection molding the anchor body to the suture.
8. A method of anchoring a tissue to a bone of a human or an animal without tying a knot, the method comprising: passing a free suture limb of a length of suture through the tissue, the length of suture also having a fixed suture limb, secured to an anchor body; drawing the free suture limb through a suture tunnel formed in the vicinity of the fixed suture limb, the suture tunnel extending along an external surface of the anchor body intermediate a proximal and distal end of the anchor body, and thereby defining a suture loop around the tissue; inserting the anchor body into a bone hole; and locking the suture loop so as to prevent tissue pull-out.
9. The method of claim 9 further comprising compressing a portion of the length of suture between an internal wall of the bone hole and the exterior surface of the anchor body.
10. The method of claim 8 further comprising drawing the tissue towards the anchor body by pulling on the free suture limb.
11. The method of claim 9 wherein the tissue is drawn towards the anchor body by pulling on the free suture limb after the anchor body has been inserted into the bone hole.
12. The method of claim 8 wherein the fixed suture limb is secured to an exterior of the anchor body.
13. The method of claim 8 wherein fixed suture limb and suture tunnel are disposed along the anchor body and are axially coincident each other.
14. The method of claim 8 wherein inserting the anchor body into the bone hole further comprises locking the anchor body within the bone hole with at least one bone locking feature selected from the group consisting of a barb, ridge, thread, and rib.
15. A method of tissue repair, comprising: installing an anchor body in bone, the anchor body having a suture extending along at least a portion of the anchor body and a snare device extending along a suture tunnel of the suture, the suture tunnel fixed to the anchor body intermediate a proximal and distal end of the anchor body; forming, with the suture and the snare, a knotless closed loop having an adjustable perimeter, the closed loop including the suture tunnel.
16. The method of claim 15, further comprising adjusting the length of the knotless closed loop to approximate tissue to bone.
17. The method of claim 15, further comprising: installing the anchor body into a hole in the bone.
18. The method of claim 15, further comprising; passing a free end of the suture through tissue to be fixated, and then through an eyelet of the snare; and pulling on the snare to allow the suture free end to extend through the suture tunnel.
19. The method of claim 15 wherein the suture includes a suture fixed limb secured to an exterior of the anchor body intermediate the proximal and distal end of the anchor body.
20. The method of claim 19 wherein the suture fixed limb and suture tunnel are disposed along the anchor body and are axially adjacent each other.
