METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR INTERACTIVE TELEVISION GUIDES AND PROGRAM RULES
</title>

<abstract>
Developments in interactive programming guides that utilize a confluence of users/viewers from data that may be blockchain and/or data collection from IoT and other devices, proximity sensing of viewership, and both machine and guided learning over a large dataset to produce rules for AI selection of content, format, and features presented to currently active or a nearby set of television users/viewers. Blockchain may be implemented separately for accounting, verification, billing, and/or fees/royalty payments owed to content owners/copyright holders. Playback may be initiated by a remote device and played on a same or yet another or a plurality of remote devices.

<claims>
1. An Electronic Program Guide (EPG) enabled by a set-top or OTT box onto a large screen display, wherein the EPG contains and/or references content selected based on a proximity of users to the large screen display.
2. The EPG according to claim 1, wherein content and/or content referenced by the EPG changes with a changing composition of users in close proximity to the display.
3. The EPG according to claim 2, wherein the EPG changes are based on individual data and history of the individual users and the users as a group.
4. The EPG according to claim 2, wherein the content is selected based on AI rules vetted over a large dataset in a machine learning environment and applied across a plurality of users' social media postings and targeting a confluence of the users for programming selections.
5. The EPG according to claim 4, wherein the large dataset comprises block chain data from a plurality of Internet connected devices.
6. The EPG according to claim 4, wherein the programming selections comprise video content selected from YouTube or other video content providers based on metadata mined from the content including recognizing objects in images of the content.
7. The EPG according to claim 4, wherein the content selections displayed are based on an emotional response of the user.
8. A method comprising: transmitting, by a computing device, content to one or more user devices; retrieving, by the computing device from one or more sources, an application layout file associated with a feature related to the content; customizing, by the computing device, the application layout file to generate one or more customized application layout files each configured for a respective device platform and user of the device, wherein each of the one or more customized application layout files comprising a structure that indicates attributes of display layout data for rendering the feature related to the content for the respective device platform and user; and transmitting, by the computing device, the one or more customized application layout files to a plurality of user devices each implementing one of the plurality of device platforms to allow each of the plurality of user devices to output related to the content.
9. The method according of claim 8, wherein the content is selected via an Artificial Intelligence (AI) program.
10. The method according to claim 8, wherein content of the program guide (e.g. program descriptions) are modified in a guided learning environment intended to produce program guide content that appeals to at least one user.
11. The method according to claim 8, wherein the content for the respective device platform and user is selected using data about the user and/or activities of the user contained in blockchain comprising data from at least one IoT device.
12. The method according to claim 8, wherein the content is determined based on user data authorized by the user via a privacy statement comprising a multi-level privacy-by-design opt-in format.
13. The method according to claim 8, wherein the structure's attributes comprise a general location and allows the receiving device to effect actual placement and at least one attribute is generated on an AI based platform.
14. The method according to claim 8, wherein the step of transmitting comprises transmitting over different networks to different user devices, the method further comprising a step of modifying presented content for each user according to each user.
15. The method according to claim 14, wherein one user device is transmitted to via a mobile phone network not used by the other networks to receive the content, another device is transmitted to via a mobile data network not used by the other devices to receive the content, yet another device is transmitted to via a Wi-Fi network not utilized by the other devices to receive the content, yet still another device is transmitted to via a cable television-like network not utilized by the other devices to receive the content but may be (or intended to be utilized) by the other user's to view the content on a larger screen than the other devices.
16. The method according to claim 14, wherein the files are constructed and/or arranged based on rules verified over a large dataset of the same and other user selections and performance correlated to the user.
17. The method according to claim 14, wherein the customized application layout file is customized for different users and each users' devices in close proximity.
18. The method according to claim 14, wherein the differences in content between users comprises adjustments or layout derived from a deep learning or machine learning environment that takes a user's emotion state into account.
19. An Electronic Programming Guide (EPG) comprising a machine learning environment configured to receive data about user activities from Internet connected devices wherein a user has approved use of the data via a privacy policy comprising a multi-level opt-in strategy explaining the use of the data in the selection of content to be presented to the user and wherein the machine learning environment comprises a large dataset of block chain collected data, including IoT data from different devices, about the user and other users for the creation of rules specifically directed toward the user, and wherein the EPG is configured to dynamically change based on users currently in a same room and wherein choices on the EPG are presented according to weighting that considers the viewers as a whole including a pattern derived from the users' data that points to choices reflecting a confluence of the users.
20. The EPG according to claim 19, further comprising a rating device that utilizes image of user/viewers to determine an attractiveness score which is utilized in making content recommendations or listings on the EPG.
