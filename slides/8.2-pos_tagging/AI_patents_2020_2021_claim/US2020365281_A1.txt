VIDEO CONFERENCING AND REAL-TIME SESSION BRIDGING FOR SERVICE DELIVERY USING DRONE TECHNOLOGY
</title>

<abstract>
A system for video conferencing and real-time session bridging for services delivery is provided. The system comprises a processor, a memory, and an application that dispatches, based on receiving a request for assistance at a remote location, an unmanned aerial vehicle to the remote location, the vehicle containing two-way communication functionality. The system also joins a communication session initiated by the vehicle. Based on information exchanged during the communication session, the system also determines a provider device to assist a user of the vehicle causes the provider device to be joined to the communication session. The unmanned aerial vehicle is a drone device programmed to depart the remote location when the communication session ends. A user of the provider device renders assistance via at least one of voice, video, and text media to the user of the vehicle during the communication session.

<claims>
1. A system for video conferencing and real-time session bridging for services delivery, comprising: at least one processor; a memory; and an application stored in the memory that when executed on the at least one processor: dispatches, based on receiving a request for assistance at a remote location, an unmanned aerial vehicle to the remote location, the unmanned aerial vehicle containing two-way communication functionality; joins a communication session initiated by the unmanned aerial vehicle; determines, based on information exchanged during the communication session, a provider device to assist a patient; enabling the provider device to be joined to the communication session; and, enabling the unmanned aerial vehicle to dispense materials to the patient at the instruction of at least one of: a user of the provider device or a triage function.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the unmanned aerial vehicle is a drone device programmed to depart the remote location when the communication session ends.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the application receives at least one of voice, video, and text media for the user of the provider device to render assistance to the patient during the communication session.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is associated with the triage function that is configured to make determinations of the provider device to engage with the patient.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the triage function is configured to search databases to evaluate provider devices as candidates to engage with the patient.
6. The system of claim 3, wherein the user of the provider device is a healthcare provider.
7. A method for video conferencing and real-time session bridging for services delivery, comprising: a computer joining a wireless communication session initiated by a remotely located device; the computer, based on information provided by the device, determining a first provider device to engage the remotely located device; the computer causing the first provider device to be joined to the communication session; and the computer, at least upon advice issued by the first provider device, causing materials to be dispensed by the remotely located device to a patient.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the remotely located device is an unmanned aerial vehicle.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the remotely located device is dispatched by the computer to the patient.
10. The method of claim 7, wherein the information provided by the patient describes a problematic situation experienced or to be experienced by the patient.
11. The method of claim 7, wherein a user of the first provider device is knowledgeable in the situation of the patient.
12. The method of claim 7, wherein the computer reviews information about a plurality of provider device users prior to causing the first provider device to be joined to the communication session.
13. A method for video conferencing and real-time session bridging for services delivery, comprising: a provider device causing an unmanned aerial vehicle to be sent to a remote user; the provider device, after the unmanned aerial vehicle is received by the remote user, joining a communication session initiated by the remote user to a triage server; the provider device engaging in direct communication with the remote user; and the provider device, based at least on the direct communication, causing the unmanned aerial vehicle to dispense materials to the remote user.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the unmanned aerial vehicle is a drone device with two-way communication functionality.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein triage server, upon joining the session initiated by the remote user, joins the provider device to the session.
16. The method of claim 13, wherein the direct communication engaged in by the provider device with the remote user comprises a user of the provider device diagnosing a problem reported by the remote user.
17. The method of claim 13, wherein the triage server previously selected the provider device from a plurality of provider devices to provide assistance to the remote user.
18. The method of claim 13, wherein the communication session further comprises the remote user, the provider device, and the triage server exchanging at least one of still images and video content.
19. The method of claim 13, wherein the unmanned aerial vehicle returns to the triage server when the communications session ends.
20. Non-transitory computer readable storage having stored thereon instructions for causing at least one processor to perform the method according to claims 13.
