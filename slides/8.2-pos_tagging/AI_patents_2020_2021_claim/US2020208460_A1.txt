VEHICLE HANDS-FREE SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Vehicle hands-free liftgate systems of vehicles. Responsive to an object movement at the rear of the vehicle during a first vehicle mode, proximity signals generated by proximity sensors of the vehicle responsive to the object movement are associated with an actuation case, and responsive to another object movement at the rear of the vehicle during a second vehicle mode, proximity signals generated by the proximity sensors responsive to the another object movement are associated with a non-actuation case. A classifier is generated based on application of the proximity signals and associations to a machine learning algorithm. Responsive to a further object movement associated with the actuation case at the rear of the vehicle during a third vehicle mode, a determination is made that the further object movement is associated with the actuation case based on the classifier. Responsive to the determination, the liftgate is actuated.
