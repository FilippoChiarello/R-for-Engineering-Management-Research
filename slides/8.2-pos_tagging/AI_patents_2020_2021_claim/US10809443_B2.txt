Techniques for enhanced diffusion lighting
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for creating, configuring, and employing diffusion light devices are presented. Such light device(s) can comprise or be associated with a light management component (LMC) that can employ sensors to monitor environmental conditions in a defined area of people or vehicles, and a diffusion component that can diffuse or otherwise process light. At a least a portion of the diffusion component and/or a light component can be formed of a fabric that can emit light and/or diffuse light. LMC can enhance function of the light device to manage diffusion of light or perform other tasks to enhance user experience and safety and security of people or vehicles. Based on results of analyzing sensor data relating to the conditions, LMC can determine and facilitate implementing an adjustment(s) to a parameter(s) of the diffusion component or light component to achieve desired emission or diffusion of light.
