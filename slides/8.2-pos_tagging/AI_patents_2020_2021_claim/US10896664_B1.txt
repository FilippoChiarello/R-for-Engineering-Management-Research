<title>
Providing adversarial protection of speech in audio signals
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments for providing adversarial protection of speech in audio signals by a processor. Security defenses on one or more audio devices may be provide against automated audio analysis of audio signals by using adversarial noise.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method, by one or more processors, for providing adversarial protection in audio signals, comprising: providing security defenses on one or more audio devices against automated audio analysis of audio signals by embedding an adversarial noise within the audio signals containing speech such that the adversarial noise distorts the speech to prevent the automated audio analysis thereof, wherein the adversarial noise is embedded to target misclassification of the speech by the automated audio analysis at one of a phoneme-level, a word-level, and a sentence-level notwithstanding the speech is maintained to be intelligible by a user.
2. The method of claim 1, further including applying the adversarial noise to a digital audio signal, an analog audio signal, or a combination thereof.
3. The method of claim 1, further including determining or selecting a type of the adversarial noise to implement on a digital audio signal, an analog audio signal, or a combination thereof in a communication.
4. The method of claim 1, further including analyzing the audio signals using a machine learning operation, wherein the audio signals are communicated and transmitted in real-time from the user or from a recorded message located in an audio database.
5. The method of claim 1, further including estimating a theoretical security defense strength of the adversarial noise.
6. The method of claim 1, further including estimating an actual security defense strength of the adversarial noise via a feedback loop operation.
7. The method of claim 1, further including adjusting a degree of security defense strength of the adversarial noise.
8. A system for providing adversarial protection in audio signals, comprising: one or more computers with executable instructions that when executed cause the system to: provide security defenses on one or more audio devices against automated audio analysis of audio signals by embedding an adversarial noise within the audio signals containing speech such that the adversarial noise distorts the speech to prevent the automated audio analysis thereof, wherein the adversarial noise is embedded to target misclassification of the speech by the automated audio analysis at one of a phoneme-level, a word-level, and a sentence-level notwithstanding the speech is maintained to be intelligible by a user.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions apply the adversarial noise to a digital audio signal, an analog audio signal, or a combination thereof.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions determine or select a type of the adversarial noise to implement on a digital audio signal, an analog audio signal, or a combination thereof in a communication.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions analyze the audio signals using a machine learning operation, wherein the audio signals are communicated and transmitted in real-time from the user or from a recorded message located in an audio database.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions estimate a theoretical security defense strength of the adversarial noise.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions estimate an actual security defense strength of the adversarial noise via a feedback loop operation.
14. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions adjust a degree of security defense strength of the adversarial noise.
15. A computer program product, for providing adversarial protection in audio signals by one or more processors, the computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable program code portions stored therein, the computer-readable program code portions comprising: an executable portion that provides security defenses on one or more audio devices against automated audio analysis of audio signals by embedding an adversarial noise within the audio signals containing speech such that the adversarial noise distorts the speech to prevent the automated audio analysis thereof, wherein the adversarial noise is embedded to target misclassification of the speech by the automated audio analysis at one of a phoneme-level, a word-level, and a sentence-level notwithstanding the speech is maintained to be intelligible by a user.
16. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that applies the adversarial noise to a digital audio signal, an analog audio signal, or a combination thereof.
17. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that determines or selects a type of the adversarial noise to implement on a digital audio signal, an analog audio signal, or a combination thereof in a communication.
18. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that analyzes the audio signals using a machine learning operation, wherein the audio signals are communicated and transmitted in real-time from the user or from a recorded message located in an audio database.
19. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that: estimates a theoretical security defense strength of the adversarial noise; or estimates an actual security defense strength of the adversarial noise via a feedback loop operation.
20. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that adjusts a degree of security defense strength of the adversarial noise.
