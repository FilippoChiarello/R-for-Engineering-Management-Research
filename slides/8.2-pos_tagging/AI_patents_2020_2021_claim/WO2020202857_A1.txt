PREDICTIVE CLASSIFICATION OF FUTURE OPERATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A system evaluates a plurality of faults in an operation of a machine at a set of future instances of time. The system uses a neural network including a first subnetwork sequentially connected with a sequence of second subnetworks for each of the future instance of time such that an output of one subnetwork is an input to a subsequent subnetwork. The first subnetwork accepts the current time-series data and the current setpoints of operation of the machine. Each of the second subnetworks accepts the output of a preceding subnetwork, an internal state of the preceding subnetwork, and a future setpoint for a corresponding future instance of time. Each of the second subnetworks outputs an individual prediction of each fault of a plurality of faults at the corresponding future instance of time.
