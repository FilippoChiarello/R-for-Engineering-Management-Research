<title>
Multi-tier network for task-oriented deep neural network
</title>

<abstract>
A method for controlling an autonomous vehicle is disclosed. The method may include receiving image data. The image data may be logistically classified by a first neural network as pertaining to one situation of a plurality of situations. Based on this logistic classification, the image data may be assigned to a second neural network that is specifically trained to address the one situation. The second neural network may perform regression on the image data. Thereafter, the vehicle may be control with a command based on the regression.
