Detection and Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea
</title>

<abstract>
An obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) suppression system includes a respiration monitoring device for detecting one or more OSA incidents, the respiration monitoring device including one or more of an accelerometer, a CO2 sensor, an oximeter or an audio sensing device. The OSA system further includes a patch adapted to be externally coupled on a dermis of a user, the patch including a flexible substrate and an adhesive on a first side adapted to adhere to the dermis of the user, an electronic package directly coupled to the substrate, the electronic package including a processor, and electrodes directly coupled to the substrate and the electronic package.

<claims>
1. An obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) suppression system comprising: a respiration monitoring device for detecting one or more OSA incidents, the respiration monitoring device comprising one or more of an accelerometer, a CO2 sensor, an oximeter or an audio sensing device; and a patch adapted to be externally coupled on a dermis of a user, the patch comprising a flexible substrate and an adhesive on a first side adapted to adhere to the dermis of the user, an electronic package directly coupled to the substrate, the electronic package comprising a processor, and electrodes directly coupled to the substrate and the electronic package.
2. The system of claim 1, the respiration monitoring device located separately from the patch and in wireless communication with the patch.
3. The system of claim 1, the respiration monitoring device integrated with the patch and the one or more of the accelerometer, the CO2 sensor, the oximeter or the audio sensing device are each directly coupled to the substrate.
4. The system of claim 1, the respiration monitoring device adapted to provide an OSA signal to the processor in response to detecting the one or more OSA incidents.
5. The system of claim 4, the patch adapted to, in response to receiving the one or more OSA incidents, generating an electrical stimuli to one or more nerves of the user via the electrodes.
6. The system of claim 5, the electrical stimuli causing a tongue of the user to move to open an airway of the user.
7. The system of claim 5, the one or more nerves comprising one or more branches of a hypoglossal nerve.
8. The system of claim 1, the respiration monitoring device adapted to measure one or more of an airflow of the user, a blood oxygenation level of the user, or a cessation of lung motion of the user.
9. The system of claim 1, further comprising a posture indication device that is adapted to detect changes in a body position of the user.
10. The system of claim 5, the electrical stimuli comprising square waves having an amplitude between 10 and 100 volts, pulse widths between 100 and 500 microseconds, and a pulse repetition rate of between 2 and 60 pulses per second.
11. A method of suppressing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the method comprising: detecting one or more OSA incidents using a respiration monitoring device, the respiration monitoring device comprising one or more of an accelerometer, a CO2 sensor, an oximeter or an audio sensing device; and treating the one or more OSA incidents using a patch adapted to be externally coupled on a dermis of a user, the patch comprising a flexible substrate and an adhesive on a first side adapted to adhere to the dermis of the user, an electronic package directly coupled to the substrate, the electronic package comprising a processor, and electrodes directly coupled to the substrate and the electronic package.
12. The method of claim 11, the respiration monitoring device located separately from the patch and in wireless communication with the patch.
13. The method of claim 11, the respiration monitoring device integrated with the patch and the one or more of the accelerometer, the CO2 sensor, the oximeter or the audio sensing device are each directly coupled to the substrate.
14. The method of claim 11, the respiration monitoring device providing an OSA signal to the processor in response to detecting one or more OSA incidents.
15. The method of claim 14, further comprising: activating the patch in response to the detecting, the activating generating an electrical stimuli to one or more nerves of the user via the electrodes.
16. The method of claim 15, the electrical stimuli causing a tongue of the user to move to open an airway of the user.
17. The method of claim 15, the one or more nerves comprising one or more branches of a hypoglossal nerve.
18. The method of claim 11, further comprising the respiration monitoring device measuring one or more of an airflow of the user, a blood oxygenation level of the user, or a cessation of lung motion of the user.
19. The method of claim 11, further comprising using a posture indication device to detect changes in a body position of the user.
20. The method of claim 15, the electrical stimuli comprising square waves having an amplitude between 10 and 100 volts, pulse widths between 100 and 500 microseconds, and a pulse repetition rate of between 2 and 60 pulses per second.
