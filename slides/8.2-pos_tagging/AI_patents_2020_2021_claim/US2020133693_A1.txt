<title>
Dynamic User Interface for Predicted Procedures
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques are disclosed relating to predicting events based on automation parameters and initiating a procedure to request user input. In some embodiments, the system automatically selects one or more component types to display an interface to request the user input, e.g., based on user interface elements associated with the procedure. These component-based techniques may be used to imitate another interface while automatically formatting the input data without a known template.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: automatically initiating, by a computing device, a procedure that requests user input based on one or more automation parameters; determining, by the computing device, a set of user interface elements for an interface to request entry of the user input; selecting, by the computing device, one or more component types that include types of user interface elements for the determined set of user interface elements; and causing output or one or more components with the user interface elements according to the selected one or more component types.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising generating a set of multiple component types based on an existing user interface, wherein the selecting is performed from among the set of multiple component types.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the outputting is performed using an audio output device based on one or more context parameters.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the one or more context parameters indicate a velocity of the computing device.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the outputting is performed via a visual display device.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the selecting selects a component type from among a plurality of compatible component types for the interface based on one or more context parameters.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more automation parameters are based on information regarding communications, calendar information, account information, location information, and time information.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising selecting multiple components types for the determined set of user interface elements and automatically formatting components corresponding to the multiple component types based on one or more display parameters.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving user input based on the output component and accessing a database based on the user input.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising selecting a communications channel via which to cause the output of the one or more components based on one or more context parameters.
11. A non-transitory computer-readable medium having instructions stored thereon that are capable of execution by a computing device to perform operations comprising: automatically initiating a procedure that requests user input based on one or more automation parameters; determining a set of user interface elements for an interface to request entry of the user input; selecting one or more component types that include types of user interface elements for the determined set of user interface elements; and causing output or one or more components with the user interface elements according to the selected ones or more component types.
12. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 11, wherein the operations further comprise: generating a set of multiple component types based on an existing user interface, wherein the selecting is performed from among the set of multiple component types.
13. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 11, wherein the selecting selects a component type from among a plurality of compatible component types for the interface based on one or more context parameters.
14. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 11, wherein the operations further comprise: selecting multiple components types for the determined set of user interface elements and automatically formatting the multiple components based on one or more display parameters.
15. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 11, wherein the operations further comprise: selecting a communications channel via which to cause the output of the one or more components based on one or more context parameters.
16. An apparatus, comprising: one or more processing elements configured to: automatically initiate a procedure that requests user input based on one or more automation parameters; determine a set of user interface elements for an interface to request entry of the user input; select one or more component types that include types of user interface elements for the determined set of user interface elements; and cause output or one or more components with the user interface elements according to the selected ones or more component types.
17. The apparatus of claim 16, wherein the apparatus is further configured to generate a set of multiple component types based on an existing user interface, wherein the apparatus is configured to select the one or more component types from among the set of multiple component types.
18. The apparatus of claim 16, wherein the apparatus if configured to select an output device for the one or more components based on one or more context parameters.
19. The apparatus of claim 18, wherein the one or more context parameters indicate a velocity of the apparatus.
20. The apparatus of claim 16, wherein the apparatus is configured to select multiple components types for the determined set of user interface elements and automatically format the multiple components based on one or more display parameters.
