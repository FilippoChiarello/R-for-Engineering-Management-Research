<title>
Information processing apparatus, information processing system and information processing method for executing document reading processing
</title>

<abstract>
Provided is an information processing apparatus that efficiently executes a series of tasks related to reading a document. An information processing system includes an upstream server, image forming apparatuses and a regional server. An apparatus-information-acquiring unit of the upstream server acquires apparatus information from plural image forming apparatuses. A task-sharing unit shares the respective tasks of a series of tasks for document data that is read by a specified image forming apparatus, based on a storage unit that is an apparatus-information-storage unit that stores an ID, position information that indicates a position in a network, and performance information for that image forming apparatuses that is included in the apparatus information. The task-sharing unit, in accordance with the ID and performance information of plural image forming apparatuses, determines and shares tasks so as to be executed by image forming apparatuses that are at nearby positions in the network.

<claims>
1. An information processing apparatus that is capable of connecting with a plurality of document reading apparatuses by a network, the information processing apparatus comprising: an apparatus-information-storage unit that stores performance information, an ID, and position of the plurality of document reading apparatuses; and a task-sharing unit that determines and shares a series of tasks for data of a document that is read by a specified document reading apparatus so that the respective tasks are executed by document reading apparatuses, of the plurality of document reading apparatuses, that are connected in a same branch as the information processing apparatus in accordance with the position information, the ID and the performance information of the plurality of document reading apparatuses, wherein the performance information indicates an ability of the respective document reading apparatus to perform one of more of said tasks such that the task-sharing unit can determine whether the respective document reading apparatus can execute the one or more of said tasks; the position information indicates a branch of the network on which the respective document reading apparatus resides such that the task-sharing unit can determine whether the respective document reading apparatus is connected in the same branch; and the ID is a code unique to the respective document reading apparatus such that the task-sharing unit can uniquely identify the respective document reading apparatus.
2. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the task-sharing unit determines to execute a next task by an apparatus of the plurality document reading apparatuses for which it is indicated in the performance information that execution of tasks that correspond to installed functions is possible, and to which data can be transmitted from the document reading apparatus that shared execution of the previous task with the least load.
3. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the task-sharing unit determines to also execute the tasks by a regional information processing apparatus that exists in a region of the network and to which data can be transferred from the document reading apparatus with little load.
4. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the ID is a serial number of the corresponding document reading apparatus.
5. An image processing system that includes a plurality of document reading apparatuses connected to an information processing apparatus by a network; wherein each of the document reading apparatuses comprises an apparatus-information-transmitting unit that transmits, to the information processing apparatus, apparatus information that includes performance information, an ID, and position information of the respective document reading apparatus in accordance with a request from the information processing apparatus; the information processing apparatus comprises: an apparatus-information-acquiring unit that acquires the apparatus information from the plurality of document reading apparatuses; an apparatus-information-storage unit that stores the plurality of apparatus information that is acquired by the apparatus-information-acquiring unit; and a task-sharing unit that determines and shares execution of the respective tasks of a series of tasks for data of a document that is read by a specified document reading apparatus so that a document reading apparatus, of the plurality of document reading apparatuses, which is connected in a same branch of the network as the information processing apparatus executes a task in accordance with the position information, the ID and the performance information that are stored in the apparatus-information-storage unit for each of the plurality document reading apparatuses, wherein the performance information indicates an ability of the respective document reading apparatus to perform one of more of said tasks such that the task-sharing unit can determine whether the respective document reading apparatus can execute the one or more of said tasks; the position information indicates a branch of the network on which the respective document reading apparatus resides such that the task-sharing unit can determine whether the respective document reading apparatus is connected in the same branch; and the ID is a code unique to the respective document reading apparatus such that the task-sharing unit can uniquely identify the respective document reading apparatus.
6. An information processing method that is executed by an information processing apparatus that is connected to a plurality of document reading apparatuses by a network, and causes the information processing apparatus to: store performance information, an ID and position information of each of the plurality of document reading apparatuses; and determine and share execution of respective tasks of a series of tasks for data of a document that is read by a specified document reading apparatus so that a document reading apparatus, of the plurality of document reading apparatuses, which is connected in a same branch of the network as the information processing apparatus executes a task in accordance with the position information, the ID and the performance information that are stored for each of the plurality document reading apparatuses, wherein the performance information indicates an ability of the respective document reading apparatus to perform one of more of said tasks such that the task-sharing unit can determine whether the respective document reading apparatus can execute the one or more of said tasks; the position information indicates a branch of the network on which the respective document reading apparatus resides such that the task-sharing unit can determine whether the respective document reading apparatus is connected in the same branch; and the ID is a code unique to the respective document reading apparatus such that the task-sharing unit can uniquely identify the respective document reading apparatus.
