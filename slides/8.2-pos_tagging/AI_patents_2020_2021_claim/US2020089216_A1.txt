SYSTEMS FOR SELF-ORGANIZING DATA COLLECTION AND STORAGE
</title>

<abstract>
Systems for self-organizing data collection and storage in a power generation environment are disclosed. A system may include a data collector for handling sensor inputs from sensors in the power generation environment, the sensors configured to sense at least one of an operational mode, a fault mode, and a health status of a target system. The target system may include a fuel handling system, a power source, a turbine, a generator, a gear system, an electrical transmission system, or a transformer. The system may also include a self-organizing system for self-organizing a storage operation of the data, a data collection operation of the sensors, or a selection operation of the plurality of sensor inputs. The self-organizing system may organize a swarm of mobile data collectors to collect data from a plurality of target systems.
