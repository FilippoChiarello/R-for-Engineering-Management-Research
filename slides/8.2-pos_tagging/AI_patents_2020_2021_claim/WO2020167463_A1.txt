<title>
INTERFACE FOR FAULT PREDICTION AND DETECTION USING TIME-BASED DISTRIBUTED DATA
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques are disclosed for generating and utilizing a time-based distribution of I/O latency and other performance characteristics to identify potential device failures in a system that includes storage devices, such as a distributed software-defined storage system. A user interface is implemented that allows users to request and selectively view I/O latency and other data over a configurable time-based or histogram-based distribution. The user interface further enables comparison of the I/O latency distribution to data from other devices in the same class to identify potential failures.

1. A computer-implemented method for operating a storage network, the method comprising:
instantiating an interface for managing operational health of a software-defined storage network, wherein the interface is configured to enable selection of a range of input/output latency ranges and a time period for performance data for input/output operations executed at a selected storage device of a plurality of storage devices of the storage network;
receiving a request for performance data collected for input/output operations executed at a selected storage device of the plurality of storage devices, the request including a selected latency range and a selected time period;
responsive to receiving the request, accessing a data store storing thereon performance data collected for input/output operations executed at the plurality of storage devices;
based on the accessed performance data and the selected latency range and selected time period, determining a time-based I/O performance profile for the selected storage device and a characteristic time-based I/O performance profile for a representative group of storage devices having common characteristics with the selected storage device; and
returning, via the interface:
data usable to enable a comparison between the time-based I/O performance profile for the selected storage device and the characteristic time-based I/O performance profile; and
data usable to render an indication of whether the time-based I/O performance profile for the selected storage device is indicative of a probable fault.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 , further comprising returning, via the interface, data usable to render a deviance threshold that is determined based on a difference between the time-based I/O performance profile for the storage device and the characteristic time-based I/O performance profile.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the performance data comprises latencies for I/O operations that were executed at the storage device.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the time-based I/O performance profile comprises a distribution of numbers of metrics that fell within each of a plurality of metric ranges.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the time-based I/O performance profile comprises a total number of I/O operations where associated latencies were greater than a threshold.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the data usable to render a histogram indicative of a count of latencies that fall into latencies of the selected latency range and within the selected time period.
7. A computing device comprising:
one or more processors;
a memory in communication with the one or more processors, the memory having computer-readable instructions stored thereupon which, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the computing device perform operations comprising:
receiving a request for performance data for input/output operations executed at a storage device of a plurality of storage devices of a software-defined storage network, the request including a selected latency range and a selected time period;
responsive to receiving the request, accessing a data store storing thereon a historical record of latencies for input/output operations executed at the plurality of storage devices; based on the accessed data, determining a time-based I/O performance profile for the storage device that is based on one or more performance metrics for the storage device at the selected latency range and selected time period;
determining a characteristic time-based I/O performance profile for a representative group of storage devices having common characteristics with the storage device;
returning data usable to render:
a visual representation of the time-based I/O performance profile for the storage device and the characteristic time-based I/O performance profile; and
a visual representation of a predetermined deviance threshold that is indicative of the storage device entering a marginal performance state.
8. The computing device of claim 7, wherein the data comprises data usable to render a probability that the storage device will enter a marginal performance state exceeds a predetermined threshold, and wherein the probability is determined in part on a difference between the time-based I/O performance profile for the storage device and the characteristic time-based I/O performance profile for the representative group of storage devices.
9. The computing device of claim 7, wherein the time-based I/O performance profile comprises a total number of I/O operations where associated latencies were greater than a threshold.
10. The computing device of claim 8, wherein the plurality of storage devices is an erasure coding group or a group of mirrored devices.

14. The computing device of claim 7, wherein:
the time-based I/O performance profile comprises a distribution of numbers of metrics that fell within each of a plurality of metric ranges; and
the determining that the storage device is no longer in the marginal performance state is based on determining that latencies for I/O operations associated with the storage device have not exceeded a predetermined threshold for a specified time period.
15. A computer-readable medium having encoded thereon computer-executable instructions that, when executed, cause one or more processing units of a computing device to execute a method comprising:
receiving a request for performance data for input/output operations executed at a storage device of a plurality of storage devices of a software-defined storage network, the request specifying a selected latency range and selected time period;
