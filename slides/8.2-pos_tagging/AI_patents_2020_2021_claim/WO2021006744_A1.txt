SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR POSITIONING OF A FEED SPREADER IN AQUACULTURE PEN FOR FAMING OF MARINE ORGANISMS
</title>

<abstract>
This publication relates to a system for feeding marine organisms within an aquaculture pen in a fish farm and a method for moving the feeding system to a preferred position. The feed system comprises a feed spreader (4) connected to a 5feed station (9) by a tubular (6) and to an outlet for the feed. The feed spreader (4) is connected to the aquaculture pen ring (3) by at least one adjustable fastening means. The method for adjusting the feeding system is by moving the feed spreader (4) to a preferred location calculated from at least one weather parameter, and by adjusting the least one adjustable fastening means.

<claims>
1. A feeding system for feeding marine organisms within an aquaculture pen (1) in a fish farm (10) comprising a floating feed spreader (4) connected to a feed station (9) by a tubular (6) and the feed spreader (4) having an outlet for the feed, wherein the feed spreader (4) is connected to an aquaculture pen ring (3) with at least one adjustable fastening means.
2. A feeding system according to claim 1 , wherein the one or more fastening means comprises a rope (5) connected to a winch (2) at the aquaculture pen ring (3) and to the feed spreader (4) at the other end.
3. A feeding system according to claim 1 , wherein the one or more fastening means comprises a rope (5) connected to a winch (2) at the feed spreader (4) and to the aquaculture pen ring (3) at the other end.
4. A feeding system according to claim 2 or 3, wherein one or more of the
adjustable fastening means comprises a pulley or a block positioned under water, for submerging the feed spreader (4) by pulling on the rope, passing through the pulley or block, with one of the winches (2).
5. A feeding system according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the
system comprises one or more sensors for measuring one or more weather parameters.
6. A feeding system according to claim 5, wherein the system comprises a
control unit for receiving one or more weather parameters and operating the one or more winches (2).
7. A feeding system according to any of the preceding, wherein the system
comprises sensors for monitoring tension in the adjustable fastening means (5), for detecting ovality in the aquaculture pen ring (3).
8. Method for operating a feeding system for feeding marine organisms within an aquaculture pen (1) in a fish farm (10), wherein the method comprises the steps of: -providing a feeding system comprising:
- a floating feed spreader (4) connected to a feed station (9) by a tubular (6) and the feed spreader (4) having an outlet for the feed,
- one or more adjustable fastening means, for fixing the feed spreader (4) and moving the feed spreader (4) within the aquaculture pen (1), and
- sensors for monitoring the condition of the system and the
surroundings,
- measuring parameters relates to the feeding system and its surroundings
- calculating a preferred position for the feed spreader within the aquaculture pen (1) based on the parameters measured by the sensors, and
- moving the feed spreader (4) to the preferred position by adjusting the adjustable fastening means.
9. Method for operating a feeding system according to claim 8, wherein the one or more fastening means comprises a rope (5) connected to a winch (2) at an aquaculture pen ring (3) and to the feed spreader (4) at the other end.
10. Method for operating a feeding system according to claim 8, wherein the one or more fastening means comprises a rope (5) connected to a winch (2) at the feed spreader (4) and to an aquaculture pen ring (3) at the other end.
11. Method for operating a feeding system according to claim 9 or 10, wherein one or more of the fastening means comprises a pulley or a block positioned under water, for positioning the feed spreader (4) under water, by pulling on the rope (5), passing through the pulley or block, with one of the winches (2).
12. Method for operating a feeding system according to claim 8, wherein the sensors are measuring parameters selected from a list of: wind power, wind direction, water current, water current direction, water temperature and light conditions.
13. Method for operating a feeding system according to any of claims 9-12, wherein the system is automatically driven by a control unit that calculates a preferred position and operates one or more motor driven winches (2) to pull or release the ropes (5) to move the feed spreader (4) to said preferred position.
14. Method for operating a feeding system according to claim 9-13, wherein the method comprises the steps of measuring tension in the one or more ropes (5) for detecting ovality in the aquaculture pen ring (3) and adjusting the tension in the ropes (5) based on the measurement.
15. Method for operating a feeding system according to claim 9-13, wherein the method comprises the step of using sonar to detect ovality in the aquaculture pen ring (3) and adjusting the tension in the ropes based on the measurement.
16. Method for operating a feeding system according to claim 8-15, wherein the method comprises the step of providing a sonar as part of the system, the sonar is to be used to detect the position of the majority of fish inside the aquaculture pen (1), the position of the majority of fish is used as a parameter for calculating the preferred position of the feed spreader (4).
