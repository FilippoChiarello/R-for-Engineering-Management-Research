</title>

<abstract>
Described processes include: obtaining a first amount of cryptographic tokens transferred to burn addresses by members of a first set of entities; determining a second amount of instances of the first type of cryptographic token to be minted; determining portions of the second amount of instances of the first type of cryptographic token to be allocated to members of a second set of entities, wherein: the portions are determined based on effects determined to be caused by members of the second set of entities on performance of a computer-implemented network in which both the first set of entities and the second set of entities participate, and the effects on network performance are quantified by metrics reported by members of the first set of entities; appending to the first distributed ledger, records indicating the respective portions are transferred to respective accounts of corresponding members of the second set of entities.
