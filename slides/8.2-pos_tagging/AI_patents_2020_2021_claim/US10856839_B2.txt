<title>
Scanning to identify and delimit stationary fluid pools
</title>

<abstract>
Dynamically identifying a stationary body of fluid (102) within a test volume by scanning within the volume can entail using a first part of a pulse sequence to acoustically interrogate a region within the volume to detect pre-existing movement (124) and, via a separate acoustic interrogation constituting the second part of the pulse sequence, acoustically interrogating the region to distinguish solid from fluid. The scanning is with both interrogations as a unit, so as to span the volume with the interrogations. The body is identified, dynamically based on an outcome of the interrogations. The scanning may span, for the identifying, a current field of view (116), including normal tissue, within an imaging subject. The procedure, from scanning to identifying, may be performed automatically and without need for user intervention, although the user can optionally change the field of view to further search for stationary fluid.

<claims>
1. An acoustic interrogation system for identifying a stationary body of fluid within a test volume, the system comprising: an ultrasound transducer array; and a processor circuit coupled to the ultrasound transducer array and configured to cause the ultrasound transducer array to transmit ultrasound pulses according to a single sequence comprised of at least a first part and a second part, the single sequence configured for identifying the stationary body of fluid within the test volume, wherein the first part of the single sequence comprises a first plurality of pulses configured to detect motion within a region of the test volume without inducing motion in the region, wherein the second part of the single sequence comprises at least one motion-inducing pulse appended to the first part, at least one first tracking pulse preceding the at least one motion-inducing pulse and at least one second tracking pulse following the at least one motion-inducing pulse, wherein the processor circuit is configured to: determine whether fluid flow is present within the region based on echoes detected by the ultrasound transducer array in response to the first plurality of ultrasound pulses, analyze echoes responsive to the at least one first tracking pulse and the at least one second tracking pulse associated with the second part to determine whether the region corresponds to a fluid or a solid, wherein the analysis comprises generating graphs of pulse amplitude versus imaging depth and determining whether the graphs are staggered in a depth-wise direction, wherein graphs staggered in the depth-wise direction are indicative of the fluid, and determine that the region corresponds to stationary fluid based on the determination that fluid flow is not present and the determination that the region corresponds to the fluid.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the single sequence consists of the first part and the second part, wherein the system is configured to issue pulses in accordance with the single sequence without issuing an acoustic pulse transmission that intervenes between said first and second parts.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the region is a first region of a plurality of regions within the test volume and with a field of view of the ultrasound transducer array, wherein the processor circuit is configured to cause the ultrasound transducer array to transmit pulses in accordance with a plurality of single sequences for determining a spatial extent of the stationary body of fluid within the test volume.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the processor circuit is configured to cause the ultrasound transducer array to transmit a sequence of pulses in accordance with a first plurality of two-part sequences toward the first region, wherein the sequence of pulses includes a tracking pulse that precedes and a tracking pulse that follows at least two intervening motion-inducing pulses.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the second part further comprises a first plurality of tracking pulses that precede and a second plurality of tracking pulses that follow the motion-inducing pulse.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the first part comprises a blood flow detection pulse, wherein the second part comprises an acoustic-radiation-force-imaging push pulse, wherein amplitude is the only parameter that power-wise distinguishes the blood flow detection pulse from the acoustic-radiation-force-imaging push pulse.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein pulses of the first part of the single sequence are configured for identifying fluid within the test volume that is already moving prior to transmission of the pulses of the first part.
8. The system of claim 1, said test volume comprising a plurality of regions, said region being among said plurality of regions, said scanning comprising, after performing said both interrogations of said region, performing said both interrogations of a next region of said test volume.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor circuit is configured to determine differences in tissue, at least in part, by computing a correlation coefficient between successive images representative of the tissue.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the processor circuit is further configured, based on the computed correlation coefficient, to dynamically determining a spatial extent of a stationary body of fluid.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein determining whether the region corresponds to the fluid or the solid is further based on cross-correlating an imaging-depth-wise reference tissue image based on echoes generated responsive to the at least one first tracking pulse and an imaging-depth-wise tissue image based on echoes generated responsive to the at least one second tracking pulse.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein individual pulses of the first plurality of pulses are shorter in length than the motion-inducing pulse.
13. The system of claim 1, wherein individual pulses of the first plurality of pulses have a same length as the motion-inducing pulse.
