METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR MAXIMIZING CODEC BANDWIDTH IN VIDEO APPLICATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and apparatus for processing of video content to optimize codec bandwidth. In one embodiment, the method includes capturing panoramic imaging content (e.g., a 360° panorama), mapping the panoramic imaging content into an equi-angular cubemap (EAC) format, and splitting the EAC format into segments for transmission to maximize codec bandwidth. In one exemplary embodiment, the EAC segments are transmitted at a different frame rate than the subsequent display rate of the panoramic imaging content. For example, the mapping and frame rate may be chosen to enable the rendering of 8K, 360-degree content at 24 fps, using commodity encoder hardware and software that nominally supports 4K content at 60 fps.

<claims>
1. A method for maximizing codec throughput, the method comprising: capturing spherical content; generating a plurality of segments from the spherical content, wherein generating the plurality of segments comprises: rotating the spherical content; projecting the rotated spherical content to a rotated spherical projection; and removing at least one segment from the rotated spherical projection; combining the plurality of segments into a data structure for transmission; and transmitting the data structure at a transfer rate; and wherein the transfer rate and the data structure are configured to maximize throughput of a codec.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the transfer rate comprises 72 frames per second (fps), and each segment of the data structure comprises 3840 pixels by 1920 pixels; and wherein the codec comprises a High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) Level 5.1 codec.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein: the spherical content exceeds at least one hardware limitation of the codec; and the data structure does not exceed the at least one hardware limitation of the codec.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the at least one hardware limitation comprises either a maximum column size or a maximum row size.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the rotated spherical projection comprises an equi-rectangular projection (ERP).
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of segments comprise two segments of 270° by 90° of image content.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of segments comprise three segments of 180° by 90° of image content.
