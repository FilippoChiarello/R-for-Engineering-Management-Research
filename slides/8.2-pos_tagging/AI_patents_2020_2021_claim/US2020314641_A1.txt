<title>
RF SIGNATURE-BASED WIRELESS CLIENT IDENTIFICATION
</title>

<abstract>
In one embodiment, a device obtains radio frequency (RF) characteristic data for a wireless client. The device inputs the RF characteristic data for the wireless client to a deep learning-based encoder. The device learns a latent space representation of the RF characteristic data from the encoder. The device uses the learned latent space representation as a unique signature to identify the wireless client in a wireless network.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: obtaining, by a device, radio frequency (RF) characteristic data for a wireless client; inputting, by the device, the RF characteristic data for the wireless client to a deep learning-based encoder; learning, by the device, a latent space representation of the RF characteristic data from the encoder; and using, by the device, the learned latent space representation as a unique signature to identify the wireless client in a wireless network.
2. The method as in claim 1, further comprising: using the unique signature to verify a device type claim made by a wireless client in the wireless network.
3. The method as in claim 1, further comprising: applying a security policy to the wireless client, based on the identification of the wireless client in the wireless network.
4. The method as in claim 1, wherein the RF characteristic data for the wireless client comprises one or more of: a media access control (MAC) randomization pattern, a maximum aggregated MAC service data unit (AMSDU), MAC protocol data unit (MPDU) density support, bandwidths supported by the client, or an indication of dual s band support.
5. The method as in claim 1, wherein the encoder is part of a deep learning-based autoencoder.
6. The method as in claim 1, wherein the RF characteristic data comprises a scanning and probing pattern used by the wireless client for network discovery.
7. The method as in claim 1, wherein the RF characteristic data comprises one or more of: a beamforming capability of the client, a physical layer (PHY) rate used by the client, a scrambler seed pattern of the client, or spatial stream information for the client.
8. The method as in claim 1, wherein the RF characteristic data comprises a carrier frequency offset (CFO) patterns of the client.
9. The method as in claim 1, further comprising: storing the latent space representation in a device signature database that uses a hash table index.
10. An apparatus, comprising: one or more network interfaces to communicate with a network; a processor coupled to the network interfaces and configured to execute one or more processes; and a memory configured to store a process executable by the processor, the process when executed configured to: obtain radio frequency (RF) characteristic data for a wireless client; input the RF characteristic data for the wireless client to a deep learning-based encoder; learn a latent space representation of the RF characteristic data from the encoder; and use the learned latent space representation as a unique signature to identify the wireless client in a wireless network.
11. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein the process when executed is further configured to: using the unique signature to verify a device type claim made by a wireless client in the wireless network.
12. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein the process when executed is further configured to: apply a security policy to the wireless client, based on the identification of the wireless client in the wireless network.
13. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein the RF characteristic data for the wireless client comprises one or more of: a media access control (MAC) randomization pattern, a maximum aggregated MAC service data unit (AMSDU), MAC protocol data unit (MPDU) density support, bandwidths supported by the client, or an indication of dual band support.
14. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein the encoder is part of a deep learning-based autoencoder.
15. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein the RF characteristic data comprises a scanning and probing pattern used by the wireless client for network discovery.
16. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein the RF characteristic data comprises one or more of: a beamforming capability of the client, a physical layer (PHY) rate used by the client, a scrambler seed pattern of the client, or spatial stream information for the client.
17. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein the RF characteristic data comprises a carrier frequency offset (CFO) patterns of the client.
18. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein the process when executed is further configured to: storing the latent space representation in a device signature database that uses a hash table index.
19. A tangible, non-transitory, computer-readable medium storing program instructions that cause a device to execute a process comprising: obtaining, by the device, radio frequency (RF) characteristic data for a wireless client; inputting, by the device, the RF characteristic data for the wireless client to a deep learning-based encoder; learning, by the device, a latent space representation of the RF characteristic data from the encoder; and using, by the device, the learned latent space representation as a unique signature io to identify the wireless client in a wireless network.
20. The computer-readable medium as in claim 19, further comprising: using the unique signature to verify a device type claim made by a wireless client in the wireless network.
