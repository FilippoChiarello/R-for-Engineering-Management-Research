<title>
REMOTE MEASUREMENT OF SHALLOW DEPTHS IN SEMI-TRANSPARENT MEDIA
</title>

<abstract>
Through discrimination of the scattered signal polarization state, a lidar system measures a distance through semi-transparent media by the reception of single or multiple scattered signals from a scattering medium. Combined and overlapped single or multiple scattered light signals from the medium can be separated by exploiting varying polarization characteristics. This removes the traditional laser and detector pulse width limitations that determine the system's operational bandwidth, translating relative depth measurements into the conditions of two surface timing measurements and achieving sub-pulse width resolution.

17. A method of using a LIDAR apparatus, the method comprising the steps of: generating a polarized signal; applying at least some portion of the polarized signal onto a semi-transparent media; receiving two or more scattered signals from the semi-transparent media, wherein there is an ambiguous overlap between the two or more received scattered signals; separating the two or more received scattered signals into a first component and into a second component to remove the ambiguous overlap between the received two or more scattered signals; determining one or more characteristics of the separated first component and the separated second component; and determining, with computational equipment based on the one or more of the characteristics of the separated first component and the separated second component, one or more of: i) optical depth of a portion of the semi-transparent media, ii) physical depth of the semi-transparent media, iii) optical purity of the semi-transparent, and iv) topography characterization of the semi-transparent media.
