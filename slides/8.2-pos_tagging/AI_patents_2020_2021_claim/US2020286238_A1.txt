ITERATIVE BRANCHING STRUCTURE SEGMENTATION METHOD AND SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Some embodiments include a method, comprising: receiving an image representing a branching structure; determining a starting feature of the branching structure; selecting a subregion of the image based on the starting feature; segmenting the branching structure in the subregion; generating a set of next features based on the segmented branching structure; and for each of the next features, repeating the selecting of the subregion based on the next feature, the segmenting of the branching structure, and the generating of the set of next features.
