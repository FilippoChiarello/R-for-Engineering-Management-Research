BATTERY CAPACITY ESTIMATION METHOD AND BATTERY CAPACITY ESTIMATION DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A battery capacity estimation method includes a first step and a second step. The first step is a step of obtaining image data of a Nyquist diagram drawn by a predetermined method, based on a Nyquist plot obtained by a predetermined AC-IR measurement. The second step is a step of obtaining a battery capacity estimate value of a battery to be measured by inputting the image data of the Nyquist diagram obtained in the first step into an input layer of a pre-trained neural network model.
