<title>
System and method for omnichannel user engagement and response
</title>

<abstract>
A telephone subnet crawler is used to access automated telephone response systems and index the information, contents and structure contained therein. A database of the information, contents and structure of a plurality of automated telephone response systems is created by the telephone subnet crawler. A user interface provides a waiting party with direct access to the information, contents and structure of the automated telephone response systems contained in the database. Where an automated telephone response system requires user input, the user interface calls the automated telephone response system and navigates to the node requiring user input, provides the user input and displays the results to the user. Where an automated telephone response system connects to an operator, the user interface calls the automated telephone response system, navigates to the node for an operator, and when an operator is detected, calls the user at a user provided callback number.

<claims>
1. - An omnichannel system comprising: a chatbot having an interface configured to interact with a user and identify a user request, and access an indexed database of automatic telephone response system nodes and identify a node in a telephone response system based on the user request.
2. - The omnichannel system of claim 1, further comprising a cloud-based module configured to hold a spot in a virtual queue related to the node in the telephone response system.
3. - The omnichannel system of claim 2, further configured to allow the user to switch between a chat channel and a voice channel.
4. - The omnichannel system of claim 3, further configured to reach a live agent related to the node.
5. - The omnichannel system of claim 3, further comprising an access module configured to obtain information from a third party database to resolve the user request.
6. - The omnichannel system of claim 5, further configured to effect a change of certain data in the third party database.
7. - The omnichannel system of claim 2, further comprising a module configured to offer the user a call-back from the telephone response system.
8. - The omnichannel system of claim 2, further comprising a module configured to identify that an agent is reached or about to be reached.
9. - The omnichannel system of claim 7, further comprising a call-back module configured to effect a telephone call between the user and the agent.
10. - The omnichannel system of claim 7, further configured to schedule the call-back at a specific time period.
11. - A method comprising using a chatbot to interact with a user and identify a user request, accessing an indexed database of automatic telephone response system nodes and identifying a node in a telephone response system based on the user request.
12. - The method of claim 11, further holding a spot in a virtual queue related to the node in the telephone response system.
13. - The method of claim 12, further allowing the user to switch between a chat channel and a voice channel.
14. - The method of claim 13, further reaching a live agent related to the node.
15. - The method of claim 13, further obtaining information from a third party database to resolve the user request.
16. - The method of claim 15, further effecting a change of certain data in the third party database.
17. - The method of claim 12, further offering the user a call-back from the telephone response system.
18. - The method of claim 12, further identifying that an agent is reached or about to be reached.
19. - The method of claim 17, further effecting a telephone call between the user and the agent.
20. - The method of claim 17, further scheduling the call-back at a specific time period.
