AUTOMATIC ADAPTION OF A SEARCH CONFIGURATION
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a method for automatically adapting a search configuration of a search engine of a search service based on repeatedly occurring events. The method comprises monitoring configuration changes applied to the search configuration, detecting events using time series and determining associations between the configuration changes applied and events detected. For the events, a likelihood of an occurrence of the respective event within a predefined time frame is calculated and, if the likelihood exceeds a predefined threshold, the search configuration is automatically adapted in anticipation of the respective event according to configuration changes associated with the event.
