CUSTOMIZATION METHOD AND APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
A customization method and system for producing a product design customized for a selected environment by determining a deformation field between a mean shape of a 3D statistical shape model (SSM) of the selected environment to a new 3D scan by fitting the SSM to the new 3D scan data. And using the deformation field to deform a mesh of an existing Computer Aided Design (CAD) model of a product.

<claims>
1. A customization method for producing a product design customized for a selected environment, the method comprising: determining a deformation field between a mean shape of a 3D statistical shape model (SSM) of the selected environment to a new 3D scan by fitting the SSM to the new 3D scan data; and deforming a mesh of an existing Computer Aided Design (CAD) model of a product according to the deformation field including (i) estimating and preserving at least one local rotation by preserving at least one normal to a surface of the product, and (ii) preserving a form of one or more selected components of the product using at least one of the preserved local rotation.
2. The customization method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the as-constrained-as-possible form preservation includes approximating local rotations for each of a plurality of vertex cells, and estimating vertex positions by solving a Laplacian system.
3. The customization method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the method includes varying a Laplacian system according to user-selected constraints.
4. The customization method as claimed in claim 1, the method including generating the SSM of the selected environment from 3D scan data from one or more 3D scans of the selected environment.
5. The customization method as claimed in claim 4, the method includes creating a deformation field by registering the 3D scan data to the SSM.
6. The customization method as claimed in claim 4 or 5, the method includes creating the SSM by registering the 3D scan data to the SSM such that the SSM comprises a 3D model of a same topology and distribution as the 3D scan data.
7. The customization method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the method includes minimizing stretching and/or bending energy to achieve realistic surface deformation.
8. The customization method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the method includes preserving local rigidity by splitting a surface of the product into overlapping cells and minimizing a transformation in each of the cells to be as-rigid-as-possible.
9. The customization method as claimed in claim 8, wherein a cell covers triangles incident upon a vertex, or a one-ring neighbourhood of a vertex.
10. The customization method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the method includes iterative rotation estimation.
11. The customization method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the method includes generating a tetrahedral mesh, constrained to preserve volume and to not introduce new vertices into the mesh.
12. The customization method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the method generates the SSM without employing detection or manual annotation of landmarks.
13. The customization method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the method includes receiving or accessing the CAD model.
14. The customization method as claimed in claim 1, wherein The CAD model may have been prepared using any standard Computer Aided Design environment.
15. The customization method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the product is an in-ear device and the selected environment is a portion of an ear that is to accommodate the in-ear device.
16. A customization apparatus for producing a product design customized for a selected environment, the apparatus comprising: a statistical shape model (SSM) generator configured to determine a deformation field between a mean shape of a 3D statistical shape model (SSM) of the selected environment to a new 3D scan by fitting the SSM to the new 3D scan data; and a mesh deformer configured to deform a mesh of an existing Computer Aided Design (CAD) model of a product according to the deformation field including (i) estimating and preserving at least one local rotation by preserving at least one normal to a surface of the product, and (ii) preserving a form of one or more selected components of the product using at least one of the preserved local rotation.
17. The customization apparatus as claimed in claim 16 wherein the statistical shape model generator is further configured to generate the SSM of the selected environment from 3D scan data for one or more 3D scans of the selected environment.
18. The customization apparatus as claimed in claim 16, wherein the statistical shape model generator includes a pre-processer that uniformly distributes the vertices and faces across 3D scan data while preserving overall features.
19. The customization apparatus as claimed in claim 16, wherein the statistical shape model generator includes a groupwise registrar that non-rigidly registers models to a mean.
20. The customization apparatus as claimed in claim 16, wherein the statistical shape model generator includes a variance analyzer.
