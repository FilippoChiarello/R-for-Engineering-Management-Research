<title>
SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ENABLING INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN A FIRST KNOWLEDGE BASE AND A SECOND KNOWLEDGE BASE
</title>

<abstract>
The subject-matter described herein relates to a computer-implemented method of enabling interoperability between a first knowledge base and a second knowledge base. Each knowledge base is graphically represented and includes a plurality of nodes each defining a concept and a plurality of relations linking the plurality of nodes. The first knowledge base and the second knowledge base are encoded using different coding standards. The method comprises: identifying an entity from the plurality of entities in the second knowledge base; obtaining a mapping between the identified entity from the second knowledge base and a matching entity from the first knowledge base; and creating and storing a link between the identified entity from the second knowledge base and the matching entity from the first knowledge base.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method of enabling interoperability between a first knowledge base and a third knowledge base via a second knowledge base, the method comprising: receiving a request to link a first node from the third knowledge base to the first knowledge base; identifying a first mapping between the first node from the third knowledge base and a matching first node from the second knowledge base; identifying a second mapping between the first node from the second knowledge base and a first node in the first knowledge base; and linking the first node from the third knowledge base with the first node from the first knowledge base using the first mapping and the second mapping, wherein identifying the second mapping includes: identifying a plurality of partial mappings of the first node from the second knowledge base to a respective plurality of nodes from the first knowledge base; identifying a plurality of nodes from the first knowledge base partially matching the first node from the second knowledge base; scoring the plurality of partial mappings based on a distance from the plurality of nodes from the first knowledge base included in the partial mappings and the plurality of nodes from the first knowledge base identified as partially matching the first node from the second knowledge base; ranking the plurality of partial mappings based on the distance; and selecting a highest ranked partial mapping to link the first node from the second knowledge base to the highest ranked first node from the first knowledge base, wherein scoring the plurality of partial mappings includes counting a number of hops required from each node from the first knowledge base included in a partial mapping and each of the plurality of identified partially matching nodes from the first knowledge base, wherein the number of hops is inversely proportional to the score, wherein each of the first, second, and third knowledge bases being graphically represented and including a plurality of nodes each defining a concept and a plurality of relations linking the plurality of nodes, and wherein each of the first, second, and third knowledge bases are encoded using a different coding standard.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein identifying the first mapping includes retrieving a predetermined one-to-one mapping from a database.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein identifying the second mapping between the first node from the second knowledge base and the first node from the first knowledge base includes identifying a one-to-one mapping from a database of predetermined mappings, the one-to one mapping being from the first node from the second knowledge base to the first node from the first knowledge base.
4. (canceled)
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein identifying the plurality of nodes in the first knowledge base includes: searching labels associated with the first node or each node from the first knowledge base; calculating a degree of similarity between a label of each of the plurality of nodes from the first knowledge base and a label of the first node from the second knowledge base; and disregarding any nodes from the first knowledge base having a distance from the label of the first node from the second knowledge base below a threshold.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 5, wherein calculating the degree of similarity between the label of each of the plurality of nodes from the first knowledge base and the label of the first node from the second knowledge base comprises calculating a distance between each label from the first knowledge base and the label of the first node from the second knowledge base.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 6, wherein calculating the degree of similarity comprises identifying a vector associated with each label from the first knowledge base and calculating a distance to a vector associated with a label from the second knowledge base.
8. (canceled)
9. A non-transitory computer readable medium including instructions stored thereon that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform a method of enabling interoperability between a first knowledge base and a third knowledge base via a second knowledge base comprising: receiving a request to link a first node from the third knowledge base to the first knowledge base; identifying a first mapping between the first node from the third knowledge base and a matching first node from the second knowledge base; identifying a second mapping between the first node from the second knowledge base and a first node in the first knowledge base; and linking the first node from the third knowledge base with the first node from the first knowledge base using the first mapping and the second mapping, wherein identifying the second mapping includes: identifying a plurality of partial mappings of the first node from the second knowledge base to a respective plurality of nodes from the first knowledge base; identifying a plurality of nodes from the first knowledge base partially matching the first node from the second knowledge base; scoring the plurality of partial mappings based on a distance from the plurality of nodes from the first knowledge base included in the partial mappings and the entities plurality of nodes from the first knowledge base identified as partially matching the first node from the second knowledge base; ranking the plurality of partial mappings based on the distance; and selecting a highest ranked partial mapping to link the first node from the second knowledge base to the highest ranked first node from the first knowledge base, wherein scoring the plurality of partial mappings includes counting a number of hops required from each node from the first knowledge base included in a partial mapping and each of the plurality of identified partially matching nodes from the first knowledge base, wherein the number of hops is inversely proportional to the score, wherein each of the first, second, and third knowledge bases being graphically represented and including a plurality of nodes each defining a concept and a plurality of relations linking the plurality of nodes, and wherein each of the first, second, and third knowledge bases are encoded using a different coding standard.
