RETINA VESSEL MEASUREMENT
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a method for training a neural network to quantify the vessel calibre of retina fundus images. The method involves receiving a plurality of fundus images; pre-processing the fundus images to normalise images features of the fundus images; and training a multi-layer neural network, the neural network comprising of a convolutional unit, multiple dense blocks alternating with transition units for down-sampling image features determined by the neural network, and a fully-connected unit, wherein each dense block comprises a series of cAdd units packed with multiple convolutions, and each transition layer comprises a convolution with pooling.

<claims>
1. A method for training a neural network for automated retina vessel measurement, comprising:
receiving a plurality of fundus images;
pre-processing the fundus images to normalise images features of the fundus images; and
training a multi-layer neural network on the pre-processed fundus images, the neural network comprising of a convolutional unit, multiple dense blocks alternating with transition units for down-sampling image features determined by the neural network, and a fully-connected unit, wherein each dense block comprises a series of cAdd units packed with multiple convolutions, and each transition layer comprises a convolution with pooling.
2. The method of claim 1 , may further comprise of grouping the input channels of each cAdd unit into non-overlapping groups and adding the outputs of the cAdd unit to one of the non-overlapping groups, thus forming the inputs to a next cAdd unit in the series, and for successive ones of said cAdd units, the output of a previous cAdd unit in the series is added to a different one of said non-overlapping groups.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, further comprising:
automatically detecting a centre of an optic disc in each fundus image; and cropping the respective image to a region of predetermined dimensions centred on the optic disc centre.
4. The method of claims 1 to 2, wherein pre-processing the fundus images comprises applying global contrast normalisation to each fundus image.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein pre-processing the fundus images further comprises median filtering using a kernel of predetermined size.
6. The method of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein there are five dense blocks in the multiple dense blocks.
7. The method of any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein each dense block comprises a series of cAdd units packed with two types of convolutions.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the two types of convolutions comprise a 1 x1 convolution and a 3x3 convolution. 9. The method of any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the convolution of each transition layer is a 1 x1 convolution.
10. A method of quantifying the vessel calibre of a retina fundus image, comprising:
receiving a retina fundus image; and
applying a neural network trained according to any one of claims 1 to 9 to the retina fundus image.
1 1. A computer system for training a neural network to generate retina vessel measurements, comprising:

The computer system of claim 1 1 , wherein the instructions further cause the processor to group the input channels of each cAdd unit into non-overlapping groups and adding the outputs of the cAdd unit to one of the non-overlapping groups, thus forming the inputs to a next cAdd unit in the series, and for successive ones of said cAdd units, the output of a previous cAdd unit in the series is added to a different one of said non-overlapping groups.
13. The computer system of claim 1 1 or 12, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to:
automatically detect a centre of an optic disc in each fundus image; and
crop the respective image to a region of predetermined dimensions centred on the optic disc centre.
14. The computer system of any one of claims 1 1 to 13, wherein the instructions cause the processor to pre-process the fundus images by applying global contrast normalisation to each fundus image. 15.
