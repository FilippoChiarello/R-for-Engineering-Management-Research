<title>
Method, system, and computer program for artificial intelligence answer
</title>

<abstract>
Provided is an artificial intelligence (AI) answering system including a user question receiver configured to receive a user question from a user terminal; a first question extender configured to generate a question template by analyzing the user question and determine whether the user question and the generated question template match; a second question extender configured to generate a similar question template by using a natural language processing and a deep learning model when the user question and the generated question template do not match; a training data builder configured to generate training data for training the second question extender by using an neural machine translation (NMT) engine; and a question answering unit configured to transmit a user question result derived through the first question extender or the second question extender to the user terminal.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An artificial intelligence (AI) answering system comprising: a user question receiver configured to receive a user question from a user terminal; a first question extender configured to generate a question template by analyzing the user question and determine whether the user question and the generated question template match; a second question extender configured to generate a similar question template by using a natural language processing and a deep learning model when the user question and the generated question template do not match, the second question extender being operable without human intervention; a training data builder configured to generate training data for training the second question extender by using an neural machine translation (NMT) engine; and a question answering unit configured to transmit a user question result derived through the first question extender or the second question extender to the user terminal.
2. The AI answering system of claim 1, wherein the question template and the similar question template are semantic triple-based question templates each including an entity, an attribute, and an instant answer.
3. The AI answering system of claim 1, wherein the training data builder, by using the NMT engine, translates a first sentence in Korean into a particular foreign language, obtains a second sentence by translating the first sentence translated into the particular foreign language back into Korean, and uses the generated second sentence to build training data.
4. The AI answering system of claim 1, wherein the second question extender comprises: a natural language expanding module configured to natural language-process on the user question; and a paraphrasing engine configured to generate a similar question template by paraphrasing the natural language-processed user question.
5. An artificial intelligence (AI) answering method comprising: receiving a user question from a user terminal; a first question extension operation for generating a question template by analyzing the user question and determine whether the user question and the generated question template match; a second question extension operation for generating a similar question template by using a natural language processing and a deep learning model when the user question and the generated question template do not match, the second question extension operation occurring without human intervention; a training data building operation for generating training data for training the second question extension operation by using an neural machine translation (NMT) engine; and a question answering operation for transmitting a user question result derived through the first question extension operation or the second question extension operation to the user terminal.
6. The AI answering method of claim 5, wherein the question template and the similar question template are semantic triple-based question templates each including an entity, an attribute, and an instant answer.
7. The AI answering method of claim 5, wherein, in the training data building operation, by using the NMT engine, a first sentence in Korean is translated into a particular foreign language, a second sentence is obtained by translating the first sentence translated into the particular foreign language back into Korean, and the generated second sentence is used to build training data.
8. The AI answering method of claim 5, wherein the second question extension operation comprises: natural language-processing the user question; and generating a similar question template by paraphrasing the natural language-processed user question.
