MONITORING ASSISTANCE SYSTEM, CONTROL METHOD THEREOF, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
In a watching assistance system that assists watching over a subject on a bed, a region setting unit performs processing of receiving a region setting image captured by an imaging device, specifying an approximate position of the bed from the region setting image by object detection, and specifying a bed region by extracting a contour of the bed from a local range including the approximate position.

<claims>
1. A watching assistance system that assists watching over a subject on a bed, the watching assistance system comprising: an image acquisition unit configured to acquire an image captured by an imaging device; a region setting unit configured to set at least one determination region in the image based on a bed region; a detector configured to detect the subject from the image acquired by the image acquisition unit; a determination unit configured to determine a state of the subject based on a relationship between the determination region and a position at which the subject is detected; and an output unit configured to provide notification according to a determination result of the determination unit, wherein the region setting unit receives a region setting image from the image acquisition unit, specifies an approximate position of the bed from the region setting image by object detection, and specifies the bed region by extracting a contour of the bed from a local range including the approximate position.
2. The watching assistance system according to claim 1, wherein the region setting unit specifies the approximate position of the bed by the object detection using a discriminator in which machine learning of a bed image is performed.
3. The watching assistance system according to claim 2, wherein the region setting image is an image looking down on the entire bed from diagonally above the bed, the discriminator detects the entire bed, and the region setting unit detects a trapezoidal contour from a local range including the entire bed detected by the discriminator.
4. The watching assistance system according to claim 2, wherein the region setting image is an image looking down on the entire bed from diagonally above the bed, the discriminator detects a corner of the bed, and the region setting unit detects a line segment starting at the corner as a contour of the bed from a local range including the corner detected by the discriminator.
5. A method for controlling a watching assistance system that assists watching over a subject on a bed, the watching assistance system control method comprising: a step of acquiring an image captured by an imaging device; a step of setting at least one determination region in the image based on a bed region; a step of detecting the subject from the acquired image; a step of determining a state of the subject based on a relationship between the determination region and a position at which the subject is detected; and a step of providing notification according to a determination result of the state of the subject, wherein the determination region setting step includes: a step of receiving a region setting image from the image acquisition unit; a step of specifying an approximate position of the bed from the region setting image by object detection; and a step of specifying the bed region by extracting a contour of the bed from a local range including the approximate position.
6. A program causing a computer to perform each step of the watching assistance system control method according to claim 5.
