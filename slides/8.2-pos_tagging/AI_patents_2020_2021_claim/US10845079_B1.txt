<abstract>
Systems and techniques are described for alerting individuals of HVAC system issues in their home. In some implementations, a monitoring system monitors a property that includes sensors located throughout the property and generates sensor data. A monitor control unit receives thermostat data from a thermostat that indicates activity of the HVAC system and temperature history of the property. The monitor control unit applies the thermostat and the sensor data to an HVAC model that is trained using past sensor data, past thermostat data, past errors of the HVAC system. The monitor control unit determines an error of the HVAC system from the HVAC model output. The monitor control unit determines an action for correcting the error of the HVAC system. The monitor control unit provides, for output, data identifying the error of the HVAC system and the action for correcting the error of the HVAC system.
