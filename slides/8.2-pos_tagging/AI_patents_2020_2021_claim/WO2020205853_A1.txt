PHYSIOLOGICAL SENSING TEXTILE APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
A garment system comprises a garment substrate formed from one or more textile-based sheets, a distributed array of a plurality of resistive pressure sensors coupled to the garment substrate at a set of first specified locations. Each of the plurality of resistive sensors comprises a pair of first textile-based outer layers each having an electrical resistance of no more than 100 ohms and a textile-based inner layer sandwiched between the pair of first textile-based outer layers having an electrical resistance of at least 1 mega-ohm. The system also includes electronics configured to process signals from the distributed array of resistive pressure sensors to determine one or more physiological properties of a wearer of the garment substrate.
