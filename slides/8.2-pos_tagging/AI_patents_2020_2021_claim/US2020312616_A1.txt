ION BEAM IRRADIATION APPARATUS AND PROGRAM THEREFOR
</title>

<abstract>
An ion beam irradiation apparatus includes modules for generating an ion beam meeting a processing condition, and a machine learning part that generates a learning algorithm using, as an explanatory variable, a processing condition during new processing and a monitored value that indicates a state of a module during a last processing immediately before the new processing, and a basic operation parameter output part that uses the learning algorithm to output an initial value of a basic operation parameter for controlling an operation of the module.

3. The ion beam irradiation apparatus as recited in claim 2, wherein the objective variable comprises a setup time period until the adjusted value is obtained; an index value indicative of whether or not the adjusted value is obtained; a beam current amplitude of the ion beam; a beam angle of the ion beam; or a beam current density of the ion beam.
4. The ion beam irradiation apparatus as recited in claim 2, wherein the plurality of modules include an ion source system-module, and wherein the learning data includes the monitored value of at least the ion source system-module.
5. The ion beam irradiation apparatus as recited in claim 4, wherein the basic operation parameter comprises at least one of a flow rate of a gas to be supplied to a plasma chamber constituting the ion source-system module, or a current to be supplied to a source magnet for generating a magnetic field inside the plasma chamber.
