IMAGE SYNTHESIZING SYSTEM AND IMAGE SYNTHESIZING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An object of the present invention is to improve the image quality of images obtained during travelling even in inferior environmental conditions. A camera 101-1 is mounted in a train 1-1, and a camera 101-2 is mounted in a train 1-2. Each of the camera 101-1 and the camera 101-2 images the same physical object at different times while moving along the same track 5. A processing apparatus 2 generates a synthetic image 7 by synthesizing images related to the same physical object imaged by the cameras 101-1 and 101-2 while moving along the same track 5, and displays the same on a display screen 2A.

<claims>
1. An image synthesizing system comprising: N (N is an integral number equal to or larger than 2) cameras; and a synthesizing unit that synthesizes images related to the same physical object imaged by the N cameras while moving along the same route.
2. The image synthesizing system according to claim 1, further comprising a control unit that sets synthesizing conditions of the images imaged by the N cameras.
3. The image synthesizing system according to claim 1, wherein the route is a track.
4. The image synthesizing system according to claim 1, wherein the route is configured using M (M is an integral number equal to or larger than 2) routes arranged adjacent to each other in parallel.
5. The image synthesizing system according to claim 4, wherein the route includes a first route and a second route that are arranged adjacent to each other in parallel, wherein the moving direction of the camera on the first route is opposite to that of the camera on the second route, and wherein the viewpoint direction of the camera on the first route is the same as that of the camera on the second route.
6. The image synthesizing system according to claim 1, wherein the cameras are mounted in different moving objects moving on the route, and the moving objects move in series.
7. The image synthesizing system according to claim 1, wherein the cameras are mounted in the same moving object moving on the route.
8. The image synthesizing system according to claim 1, comprising: a positional information acquisition unit that acquires positional information of the N cameras, wherein the synthesizing unit synthesizes images related to the same physical object extracted on the basis of the positional information.
9. The image synthesizing system according to claim 1, comprising: an object detection unit that detects a physical object from the images imaged by the N cameras, wherein the synthesizing unit synthesizes images related to the same physical object detected by the object detection unit.
10. The image synthesizing system according to claim 1, wherein only images related to the same physical object among those imaged by the N cameras are output to the synthesizing unit.
11. The image synthesizing system according to claim 1, comprising: an analyzing unit that analyzes a state of the physical object on the basis of an image synthesized by the synthesizing unit.
12. The image synthesizing system according to claim 1, wherein the N cameras image first physical objects that are different from each other at the same time when the cameras are stationary, and image the same second physical object at different times when the cameras move, and wherein the synthesizing unit synthesizes images related to the second physical object.
13. The image synthesizing system according to claim 1, wherein the cameras include a first camera and a second camera whose viewpoint directions are different from each other, and wherein the synthesizing unit synthesizes images related to the same physical object which are imaged by the first camera and the second camera and whose viewpoint directions are different from each other.
14. The image synthesizing system according to claim 1, wherein the cameras include a first camera and a second camera whose exposure conditions are different from each other, and wherein the synthesizing unit synthesizes an image of a first part of the same physical object cut out from an image imaged by the first camera with an image of a second part of the same physical object cut out from an image imaged by the second camera.
15. An image synthesizing method, comprising: imaging the same physical object with N (N is an integral number equal to or larger than 2) cameras moving along the same route; and synthesizing images related to the same physical object imaged by the N cameras.
