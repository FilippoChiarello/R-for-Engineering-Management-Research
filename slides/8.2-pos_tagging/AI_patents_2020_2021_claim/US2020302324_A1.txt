DATA COMPLEMENTING METHOD, DATA COMPLEMENTING APPARATUS, AND NON-TRANSITORY COMPUTER-READABLE STORAGE MEDIUM FOR STORING DATA COMPLEMENTING PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
A data complementing method implemented by a computer, the method includes: calculating degree of correlation of a data item corresponding to a missing data value with another data item, in a case where the missing data value exists in a plurality of data records including data values corresponding to a plurality of data items, respectively; performing complementation of the missing data value by a recursive method based on a data item value of the other data item, in a case where the degree of correlation is larger than a predetermined correlation threshold; and performing complementation of the missing data value by a statistical method based on a data value other than the missing data value of a data item corresponding to the missing data value, in a case where the degree of correlation is not larger than the correlation threshold.

<claims>
1. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium for storing a data complementing program which causes a processor to perform processing for object recognition, the processing comprising: calculating degree of correlation of a data item corresponding to a missing data value with another data item, in a case where the missing data value exists in a plurality of data records including data values corresponding to a plurality of data items, respectively; performing complementation of the missing data value by a recursive method based on a data item value of the other data item, in a case where the degree of correlation is larger than a predetermined correlation threshold; and performing complementation of the missing data value by a statistical method based on a data value other than the missing data value of a data item corresponding to the missing data value, in a case where the degree of correlation is not larger than the correlation threshold.
2. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 1, for causing the computer to execute the process, the process including performing complementation by the statistical method, in a case where a non-missing ratio of a data item is larger than a predetermined missing threshold.
3. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 2, for causing the computer to execute the process, the process further comprising: deleting a data record including a missing data value that has not been subjected to processing of performing complementation.
4. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 3, for causing the computer to execute the process, the process further comprising: processing for adjusting at least one of the correlation threshold and the missing threshold based on the number of deleted data records.
5. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 1, wherein the process for calculating the degree of correlation includes setting a correlation value between attributes including an attribute in which a non-missing ratio is equal to or less than the missing threshold to 0.
6. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 1, wherein the process for calculating the degree of correlation includes weighting by using a missing ratio of a data item.
7. A data complementing method implemented by a computer, the method comprising: calculating degree of correlation of a data item corresponding to a missing data value with another data item, in a case where the missing data value exists in a plurality of data records including data values corresponding to a plurality of data items, respectively; performing complementation of the missing data value by a recursive method based on a data item value of the other data item, in a case where the degree of correlation is larger than a predetermined correlation threshold; and performing complementation of the missing data value by a statistical method based on a data value other than the missing data value of a data item corresponding to the missing data value, in a case where the degree of correlation is not larger than the correlation threshold.
8. A data complementing apparatus comprising: a memory; and a processor coupled to the memory, the processor being configured to execute a calculation processing that includes calculating degree of correlation of a data item corresponding to a missing data value with another data item, in a case where the missing data value exists in a plurality of data records including data values corresponding to a plurality of data items, respectively; execute a regression complement processing that includes executing complementation of the missing data value by a recursive method based on a data item value of the other data item, in a case where the degree of correlation calculated by the calculation processing is larger than a predetermined correlation threshold; and execute a statistic complement processing that includes performing complementation of the missing data value by a statistical method based on a data value other than the missing data value of a data item corresponding to the missing data value, in a case where the degree of correlation calculated by the calculation processing is not larger than the correlation threshold.
