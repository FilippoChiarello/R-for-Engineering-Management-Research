OBJECT POSITION DETERMINATION CIRCUIT
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention provides an object position determination circuit (120) including a receiving circuit (122) and a detecting circuit (124). In operations of the object position determination circuit (120), the receiving circuit (122) receives an image signal (Din); and the detecting circuit (124) detects a position of an object in an N<sup>th</sup>frame of the image signal (Din), determines a partial region within an (N+M)<sup>th</sup>frame of the image signal (Din) according to the position of the object in the N<sup>th</sup>frame, and only detects the partial region within the (N+M)<sup>th</sup>frame to determine a position of the object in the (N+M)<sup>th</sup>frame, wherein N and M are positive integers.
