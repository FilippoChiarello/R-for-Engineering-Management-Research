</title>

<abstract>
A method for improved resource utilization in 5G networks includes determining at least one network parameter in response to a request received from a user for the at least one service at a particular location, wherein the at least one network parameter includes at least one of an availability of at least one edge server, a Round Trip Time (RTT), an End-to-End (E2E) delay and a network rating. Further, the method includes providing at least one recommendation for performing the at least one requested service on the UE based on the determined at least one network parameter. The at least one recommendation include at least one of an application, a RAT, a SIM and a network slice of the SIM.
