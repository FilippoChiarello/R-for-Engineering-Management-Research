DEVICES, SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PREDICTING FUTURE CONSUMPTION VALUES OF LOAD(S) IN POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
Devices, systems and methods for predicting future consumption values of load(s) in power distribution systems are provided. The present disclosure provides for receiving a request for a load prediction for at least one meter; extracting time series data relating to the at least meter; retrieving future weather conditions for a particular location based on the at least one meter; and providing the extracted data and the future weather conditions to a prediction model that predicts load usage for the at least one meter. Additionally, the present disclosure provides for performing at least one action based on the prediction, wherein the action includes outputting at least one of a communication signal and/or at least one control signal to at least one client or at least one meter.

<claims>
1. A method for predicting energy usage in by a meter in an electrical distribution system comprising: receiving a request for a load prediction for at least one meter; extracting time series data relating to the at least meter; retrieving future weather conditions for a particular location based on the at least one meter; and providing the extracted data and the future weather conditions to a prediction model that predicts load usage for the at least one meter.
2. The method as in claim 1, further comprising performing at least one action based on the prediction, wherein the action includes outputting at least one of a communication signal and/or at least one control signal to at least one client or at least one meter.
3. The method as in claim 1, wherein the request includes metadata for the at least one meter, the metadata includes at least one of a serial number, meter name, meter type, channel for meter history, facility location and/or user information.
4. The method as in claim 1, wherein if the load usage prediction exceeds a predetermined threshold, the at least one action includes shutting down the load associated to the at least one meter.
5. The method as in claim 1, further comprising building the prediction model based on historical channel data for the at least one meter and historical weather data of a location of the at least one meter.
6. The method as in claim 5, further comprising merging the historical channel data and historical weather data based on time and date.
7. The method as in claim 6, further comprising performing a regression analysis on the merged data for each day of the week.
8. The method as in claim 7, further comprising: gradient boosting results of the regression analysis; outputting the results of the gradient boosting to a time-series forecasting model; and storing an output of the time-series forecasting model as the prediction model.
9. The method as in claim 8, further comprising: extracting fifteen minute energy periods of data from the historical channel data; aggregating and averaging one hour energy periods of data from the historical channel data; subtracting the fifteen minute energy periods of data from the aggregated hourly data; performing a hybrid monte carlo algorithm on the subtracted data; and storing an output of the hybrid monte carlo model.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising: generating a stochastic 15 min sequence on the hybrid monte carlo model; grouping the data output from the sequence and determining the max per hour; adding the determined max per hour to the predicted load usage to predict a peak demand.
11. A system for predicting energy usage in by a meter in an electrical distribution system comprising: an interface that receives a request for a load prediction for at least one meter; at least one processing device that extracts data relating to the at least meter from a time series database and retrieves future weather conditions for a particular location based on the at least one meter; and a time series forecasting model that receives the extracted data and the future weather conditions and predicts load usage for the at least one meter.
12. The system as in claim 11, wherein the at least one processing device performs at least one action based on the prediction, wherein the action includes outputting at least one of a communication signal and/or at least one control signal to at least one client or at least one meter.
13. The system as in claim 11, wherein the request includes metadata for the at least one meter, the metadata includes at least one of a serial number, meter name, meter type, channel for meter history, facility location and/or user information.
14. The system as in claim 11, wherein if the load usage prediction exceeds a predetermined threshold, the at least one action includes shutting down the load associated to the at least one meter.
15. The system as in claim 11, wherein the at least one processing device builds the prediction model based on historical channel data for the at least one meter and historical weather data of a location of the at least one meter.
16. The system as in claim 15, wherein the at least one processing device merges the historical channel data and historical weather data based on time and date.
17. The system as in claim 16, wherein the at least one processing device performs a regression analysis on the merged data for each day of the week.
18. The system as in claim 17, wherein the at least one processing device gradient boosts results of the regression analysis, outputs the results of the gradient boosting to the time-series forecasting model and stores an output of the time-series forecasting model as the prediction model.
19. The system as in claim 18, wherein the at least one processing device extracts fifteen minute energy periods of data from the historical channel data, aggregates and averages one hour energy periods of data from the historical channel data, subtracts the fifteen minute energy periods of data from the aggregated hourly data, performs a hybrid monte carlo algorithm on the subtracted data and stores an output of the hybrid monte carlo model.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein the at least one processing device generates a stochastic 15 min sequence on the hybrid monte carlo model, groups the data output from the sequence and determining the max per hour and adds the determined max per hour to the predicted load usage to predict a peak demand.
