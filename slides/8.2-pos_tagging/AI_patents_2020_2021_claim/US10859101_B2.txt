Soft-bodied actuator with pinched configuration
</title>

<abstract>
A soft-bodied actuator can be configured to be in a pinched or contracted configuration when power is not supplied to the actuator. Thus, a supply of electrical energy is not needed to maintain the actuator in the pinched or contracted configuration. The actuator can include a central bladder. The central bladder can include a flexible casing that defines a central fluid chamber. The central fluid chamber can include a dielectric fluid. A first conductor and a second conductor can be operatively connected to opposite portions of the central bladder. The actuator can be configured such that, in the activated mode, the first and second conductors receive electrical energy from a power source such that they are like charged, causing the first and second conductors to repel each other. The central fluid chamber can include a particulate material to help maintain the central bladder in the pinched configuration.
