Methods and apparatuses for guiding collection of ultrasound data using motion and/or orientation data
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of technology described herein relate to guiding collection of ultrasound data collection using motion and/or orientation data. A directional indicator corresponding to an instruction for moving an ultrasound imaging device relative to a subject may be displayed in an augmented reality display. The direction of the directional indicator in the augmented reality display may be independent of an orientation of the ultrasound imaging device. The augmented reality display may include video captured by a camera that depicts the ultrasound imaging device and a fiducial marker on the ultrasound imaging device. The direction of the directional indicator may be based on the pose of the camera relative to the fiducial marker and the rotation and/or tilt of the ultrasound imaging device relative to the axis of gravity. The direction of the directional indicator may also be based on the pose of the camera relative to the subject.

<claims>
1. An apparatus, comprising: a processing device in operative communication with an ultrasound imaging device, the processing device configured to: display, in an augmented reality display, a directional indicator pointing in a particular direction relative to a subject and corresponding to an instruction for moving the ultrasound imaging device relative to the subject in the particular direction; determine a change in orientation of the ultrasound imaging device around an axis of gravity from a default orientation; and adjust a relationship between the directional indicator and the ultrasound imaging device in the augmented reality display based on the change in orientation of the ultrasound imaging device around the axis of gravity from the default orientation such that the directional indicator in the augmented reality display continues to point approximately in the particular direction relative to the subject; wherein the default orientation comprises an orientation in which a marker on the ultrasound imaging device faces a default direction relative to the subject.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the directional indicator in the augmented reality display is displayed so as to appear in the augmented reality display to be part of a real-world environment of the ultrasound imaging device.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the augmented reality display includes a video captured by a camera on the processing device.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processing device is further configured to determine the particular direction relative to the subject for moving the ultrasound imaging device.
5. The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the processing device is configured, when determining the particular direction relative to the subject for moving the ultrasound imaging device, to determine the particular direction using a statistical model.
6. The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the processing device is further configured to receive ultrasound data from the ultrasound imaging device, and wherein the processing device is configured to determine the particular direction for moving the ultrasound imaging device relative to the subject based on the ultrasound data.
