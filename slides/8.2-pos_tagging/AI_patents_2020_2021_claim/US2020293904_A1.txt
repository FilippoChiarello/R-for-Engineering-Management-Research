METHOD FOR OBJECT DETECTION USING KNOWLEDGE DISTILLATION
</title>

<abstract>
A method that may include training a student ODNN to mimic a teacher ODNN. The training may include calculating a teacher student detection loss that is based on a pre-bounding-box output of the teacher ODNN. The pre-bounding-box output of the teacher ODNN is a function of pre-bounding-box outputs of different ODNNs that belong to the teacher ODNN. The method may also include detecting one or more objects in an image, by feeding the image to the trained student ODNN; outputting by the trained student ODNN a student pre-bounding-box output; and calculating one or more bounding boxes based on the student pre-bounding-box output.
