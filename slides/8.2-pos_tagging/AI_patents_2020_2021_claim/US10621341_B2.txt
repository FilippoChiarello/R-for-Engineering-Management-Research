Cross platform user event record aggregation system
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, computer program products, and methods are described herein for cross platform user event record aggregation system. The present invention is configured to receive one or more exposure events from one or more detection systems; determine that a combination of at least a portion of the one or more exposure events indicates an intrusion in at least one of the one or more detection systems, thereby requiring elevated review of each exposure event; initiate the elevated review based on at least the indication of the intrusion; determine whether the intrusion is benign or harmful; and re-train the machine learning algorithm based on at least determining whether the intrusion is benign or harmful, thereby adjusting the score for future incidents of each exposure event in the combination of at least a portion of the one or more exposure events.
