<title>
REINFORCEMENT MACHINE LEARNING FOR ITEM DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
Images of an unknown item picked from a store are tracked, the unknown item is identified during checkout and associated with a specific item having a specific item description. The images and the specific item description are obtained by a machine-learning item detector and processed during a machine-learning training session to subsequently identify the item when subsequent item images are taken for the item for subsequent transactions at the store.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: obtaining an image of an item with an item identifier during a checkout for the item; training a machine-learning algorithm on the item image to recognize the item from subsequent images taken of the item based on the item identifier.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein obtaining further includes obtaining multiple additional images of the item with the item identifier that were captured for the item from when the item was picked by a consumer from a store shelf and carried through the store to a checkout station where the checkout is processed.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein obtaining further includes uniquely flagging the image and the multiple additional images as an unknown item until the item identifier is provided during the checkout.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein obtaining further includes receiving a transaction start event published by a transaction manager executing on a transaction terminal when the checkout is initiated on the transaction terminal.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein receiving further includes associating the image with the item identifier when the image is detected as being processed during the checkout at the transaction terminal from additional images.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein training further includes batching the image and the item identifier with other images captured for the item for other checkouts for a training session of the machine-learning algorithm.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein training further includes, comparing, by the machine-learning algorithm, a calculated item identifier produced by the machine-learning algorithm for the image before the checkout against the item identifier and adjusting, by the machine-learning algorithm factors, features, and weights for item identification processing when the calculated item identifier is different than the item identifier.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein training further includes adding, by the machine-learning algorithm, the item identifier as a new item for item identification training when the machine-learning algorithm was previously unaware of the item identifier.
9. The method of claim 1 further comprising, processing the method in combination with real-time item identification being provided in real time by the machine-learning algorithm for the item.
10. The method of claim 9 further comprising, iterating the method for other images of the item and other checkouts associated with the item.
11. The method of claim 10 further comprising, ending the iterating an accuracy of the real-time item identification for the item reaches a threshold level of accuracy.
12. A method, comprising: continuously providing item images for an item to a machine-learning algorithm during checkout transactions that include the item along with an item identifier for the item; processing training sessions with the machine-learning algorithm on the item images; and providing the machine-learning algorithm for real-time item identification of the item when an accuracy in item identification based on the training session reaches a threshold.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein continuously providing further include tracking the images as an unknown item until the item identifier is provided with the checkout transactions.
14. The method of claim 12, wherein continuously providing further includes collecting the item images for the checkout transactions that span multiple different store locations.
15. The method of claim 12, wherein continuously providing further includes grouping the item images together as batches collected for a number of the checkout transactions.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein processing further includes processing each batch as a separate training session at a preconfigured interval of time.
17. The method of claim 12, wherein providing further includes comparing predicted item identifiers produced by the machine learning algorithm against the item identifier provided with the checkout transactions to determine the accuracy.
18. The method of claim 12 further comprising, terminating the training sessions for the item identification of the item when the accuracy reaches the threshold.
19. A system, comprising: a processing device having at least one processor configured to execute instructions from a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, the instructions representing a machine-learning item detector; and the machine-learning item detector configured to: i) train a machine-learning algorithm with item images and an item identifier provided during checkout transactions for an item, ii) compare predicted item identifiers provided by the machine-learning algorithm against the item identifier provided during the checkout transactions to produce an item identification accuracy for the machine-learning algorithm, and iii) rely on subsequent predicted item identifiers provided by the machine-learning algorithm when the item identification accuracy exceeds a threshold.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein the machine-learning item detector is further configured to iv) provide the machine-learning algorithm as portion of a frictionless store component for item identification of the item within the frictionless store.
