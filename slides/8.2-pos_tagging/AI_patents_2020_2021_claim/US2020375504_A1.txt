INFORMATION PROCESSING APPARATUS, METHOD, AND INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
An information processing apparatus includes a processor, in communication with a memory, executing a process including acquiring identification information of a wireless device and information for identifying a position of the wireless device; storing a learned model generated by performing machine learning by using a training dataset including a position of a person to which the wireless device is attached and a movement destination of the person to which the wireless device is attached; inferring the movement destination of the person to which the wireless device is attached from the position of the wireless device, based on the learned model; and reporting the inferred movement destination.

<claims>
1. An information processing apparatus comprising a processor, in communication with a memory, executing a process including: acquiring identification information of a wireless device and information for identifying a position of the wireless device; storing a learned model generated by performing machine learning by using a training dataset including a position of a person to which the wireless device is attached and a movement destination of the person to which the wireless device is attached; inferring the movement destination of the person to which the wireless device is attached from the position of the wireless device, based on the learned model; and reporting the inferred movement destination.
2. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the process further includes: generating the learned model by performing the machine learning by using the training dataset including the position of the person to which the wireless device is attached and the movement destination of the person to which the wireless device is attached.
3. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the learned model is generated by performing the machine learning by using the training dataset including the position of the person to which the wireless device is attached, the movement destination of the person to which the wireless device is attached, and information of an action performed at the movement destination, and the inferring includes inferring the movement destination of the person to which the wireless device is attached and the information of the action performed at the movement destination, based on the position of the wireless device.
4. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the learned model is generated by performing the machine learning by using the training dataset including the position of the person to which the wireless device is attached, a time at which the identification information of the wireless device and the information for identifying the position of the wireless device have been acquired, and the movement destination of the person to which the wireless device is attached, and the inferring includes inferring the movement destination of the person to which the wireless device is attached, based on the position of the wireless device and the time at which the identification information of the wireless device and the information for identifying the position of the wireless device have been acquired.
5. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the training dataset is obtained by deleting aberrant data, which is detected as including an aberration, from the acquired information for identifying the position of the wireless device.
6. The information processing apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the process further includes: deleting, from a candidate of the training dataset, an input value of past position information of the person to which the wireless device is attached and an output value obtained by performing a predetermined calculation process on the input value, upon determining that the input value and the output value are aberrant values upon detecting that a difference between a tendency of the input value and a tendency of the output value exceeds a predetermined reference.
7. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the reporting includes causing the movement destination of the person to which the wireless device is attached to be displayed on a screen of a report terminal or causing the movement destination of the person to which the wireless device is attached to be output by voice sound from the report terminal.
8. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the reporting includes reporting one of the movement destinations of the person to which the wireless device is attached or reporting a flow line indicating a plurality of the movement destinations of the person to which the wireless device is attached.
9. An information processing system comprising a processor, in communication with a memory, executing a process including: acquiring identification information of a wireless device and information for identifying a position of the wireless device; storing a learned model generated by performing machine learning by using a training dataset including a position of a person to which the wireless device is attached and a movement destination of the person to which the wireless device is attached; inferring the movement destination of the person to which the wireless device is attached from the position of the wireless device, based on the learned model; and reporting the inferred movement destination.
10. A method executed by a computer, the method comprising: acquiring identification information of a wireless device and information for identifying a position of the wireless device; inferring a movement destination of a person to which the wireless device is attached from the position of the wireless device, based on a learned model generated by performing machine learning by using a training dataset including a position of the person to which the wireless device is attached and the movement destination of the person to which the wireless device is attached; and reporting the inferred movement destination.
