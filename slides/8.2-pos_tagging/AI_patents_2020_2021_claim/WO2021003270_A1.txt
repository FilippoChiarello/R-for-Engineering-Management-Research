<title>
CELLULAR MICRO-MASONRY SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Described herein are systems and methods relating to cellular micro-masonry. Systems and methods as described herein allow a user to create three-dimensional (3D) structures of cells disposed in a 3D culture medium. Systems and methods as described herein provide for the manipulation and construction of cellular structures on a single, cell-by-cell, basis.
</abstract>

<claims>
At least the following is claimed:
1. A cellular micro-masonry system, comprising:
a translation system;
an imaging system; and
a three-dimensional (3D) culture medium wherein the 3D cell culture medium comprises a plurality of hydrogel particles and a liquid cell culture medium, wherein the hydrogel particles are swelled with the liquid cell culture medium to form a granular gel.
2. The cellular micro-masonry system of claim 1 , further comprising a suction generating system, a pressure generating system, or both coupled to the translation system.
3. The cellular micro-masonry system of claims 1 or 2, wherein the translation system further comprises a micro-capillary.
4. The cellular micro-masonry system of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the translation system is configured to provide one or more of three cartesian
translational degrees of freedom (X, Y, Z), one radial degree of freedom (R), one azimuthal degree of freedom (f ), and one polar degree of freedom ( Q ).
5. The cellular micro-masonry system of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the imaging system is a multi-photon microscope.
6. The system of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the 3D culture medium has a yield stress such that the cell growth medium undergoes a phase change from a first solid phase to a second liquid phase upon application of a shear stress greater than the yield stress.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the yield stress is on the order of 10 Pa.
8. The system of any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the concentration of hydrogel particles is between 0.05% to about 1.0% by weight.
9. The system of any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the hydrogel particles have a size between about 0.1 pm to about 100 pm when swollen with the liquid cell culture medium.
10. The system of any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein a plurality of cells are disposed in a region of the 3D cell culture medium.
11. A method of cellular micro-masonry, comprising:
providing a cellular micro-masonry system according to any one of claims 1 to
10;
providing one or more cells in the three-dimensional (3D) culture media: approaching one of the one or more cells with the translation system;
engaging the one cell with the translation system using suction;
translating the one cell with the translation system according to one or more Cartesian translational degrees of freedom, one radial degree of freedom, one azithumal degree of freedom, or one polar degree of freedom; and
releasing the cell in a desired location.
12. The method of claim 11 , further comprising manually correcting errors before or after the releasing.
13. The method of claim 11 or 12, further comprising discarding cells that are not suitable.
14. The method of any one of claims 11 to 13, wherein the approaching, engaging, translating, and releasing are monitored by the user using an imaging system.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the imaging system is a multi-photon microscope.
16. The method of any one of claims 11 to 15, wherein the 3D culture medium has a yield stress such that the cell growth medium undergoes a phase change from a first solid phase to a second liquid phase upon application of a shear stress greater than the yield stress.
17. The method of any one of claims 11 to 16, wherein the yield stress is on the order of 10 Pa.
18. The method of any one of claims 11 to 17, wherein the concentration of hydrogel particles is between 0.05% to about 1.0% by weight.
19. The method of any one of claims 11 to 18, wherein the hydrogel particles have a size between about 0.1 pm to about 100 pm when swollen with the liquid cell culture medium.
20. The method of any one of claims 11 to 19, wherein the one or more cells are one or more tumor cells.
21. The method of claim 20, wherein the one or more tumor cells are mammalian breast cancer cells.
22. The method of any one of claims 11 to 21 , further comprising proliferating the one or more cells in 2D culture before providing them to the 3D culture medium.
23. The method of any one of claims 11 to 22, further comprising labeling the one or more cells with a live-cell dye.
24. The method of any one of claims 11 to 23, wherein the live-cell dye is a fluorescent dye.
25. The system of any one of claims 1 to 10, wherein the 3D cell culture medium further comprises one or more extracellular matrix components.
26. The method of any one of claims 11 to 24, wherein the 3D cell culture medium further comprises one or more extracellular matrix components.
