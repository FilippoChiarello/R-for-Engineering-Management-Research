<title>
CONTINUOUS RESTRICTED BOLTZMANN MACHINES
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the present systems and methods may provide techniques for deterministic training of cRBMs. Embodiments may utilize least square error estimates for the hidden variables, which is computationally tractable and provides improved results. For example, in an embodiment, a computer-implemented method for machine learning may comprise generating a continuous restricted Boltzman machine model by replacing discrete valued spins in a discrete restricted Boltzman machine model with continuous values, training the continuous restricted Boltzman machine model using a training dataset using a deterministic training process having hidden variables defined using least square error estimates, and using the trained continuous restricted Boltzman machine model to recognize patterns in new data.
