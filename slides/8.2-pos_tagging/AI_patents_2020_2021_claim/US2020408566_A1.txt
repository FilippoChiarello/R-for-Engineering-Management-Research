<title>
Automatic Diagnostics Generation in Building Management
</title>

<abstract>
Automatic diagnostics of a building is provided. Computer-implemented methods, systems, platforms and devices are provided to optimize building management including energy usage. Aspects and features in embodiments include note topic clustering, machine learning and optimization algorithm development, automatic issue detection and categorization, customizable issue detection and categorization, and automatic note generation. Scalable self-learning systems and methods for building operation and management are also provided. A system creates a generic anomaly detection and classification machine learning model based on a general training dataset, deploys the model in a cloud server, and creates a copy of the model for each individual building/equipment/device of a user. The system further detects and classifies anomalies from real-time sensor data based off of the model. In a further feature, the system continuously updates the model based on a user's feedback about the detection and classification.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for providing automatic diagnostics of energy management in a building, comprising: storing note information in a database, the note information including data extracted from notes input by users of an energy management system; processing the stored note information including clustering note topics and building a classification model; and automatically categorizing an issue based on the clustered note topics and the built classification model.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: enabling a user to define categories; and updating the classification model according to the user-defined categories.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising automatically generating an output note based on the clustered note topics and the built classification model.
4. A system for providing automatic diagnostics of energy management in a building, comprising: a database configured to store note information, the note information including data extracted from notes input by users of an energy management system; and at least one processor coupled to the database and configured to process the stored note information including configured to cluster note topics and build a classification model, and further configured to automatically categorize an issue based on the clustered note topics and the built classification model.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to enable a user to define categories, and wherein the at least one processor is configured to update the classification model according to the user-defined categories.
6. The system of claim 4, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to automatically generate an output note based on the clustered note topics and the built classification model.
7. A non-transitory computer-readable medium, having instructions stored thereon, that when executed by at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to perform the following operations for providing automatic diagnostics of energy management in a building, comprising: storing note information in a database, the note information including data extracted from notes input by users of an energy management system; processing the stored note information including clustering note topics and building a classification model; and automatically categorizing an issue based on the clustered note topics and the built classification model.
8. The non-transitory computer-readable medium claim 7, wherein the operations further comprise: enabling a user to define categories; and updating the classification model according to the user-defined categories.
9. The non-transitory computer-readable medium claim 7, wherein the operations further comprise automatically generating an output note based on the clustered note topics and the built classification model.
10. A scalable self-learning method for building operation and management comprising: creating a generic anomaly detection and classification machine learning model based on a general training dataset; deploying the model in a cloud server; creating a copy of the model for each individual building/equipment/device of a user; detecting and classifying anomalies from real-time sensor data based off of the model; and continuously updating the model based on a user's feedback about the detection and classification.
11. A scalable self-learning system having one or more processors for performing the method of claim 10.
12. A non-transitory computer-readable medium, having instructions stored thereon, that when executed by at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to: create a generic anomaly detection and classification machine learning model based on a general training dataset; deploy the model in a cloud server; create a copy of the model for each individual building/equipment/device of a user; detect and classify anomalies from real-time sensor data based off of the model; and continuously update the model based on a user's feedback about the detection and classification.
