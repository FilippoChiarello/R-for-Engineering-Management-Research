<title>
MULTI-VIEW ANALYSIS IN AUTOMATED TESTING APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments include a device for testing biological specimen. The device can include a receiving mechanism to receive a carrier. The carrier may include a holding area. The device may include a camera arranged to capture a plurality of images, including a first image and a second image, of the holding area. The device may include a positioning mechanism operable to adjust a relative location of the carrier to the camera. A processor in the device may utilize the camera module to: identify an edge of the first image; cause the positioning mechanism to adjust the relative location of the carrier to the camera in a manner such that, when the camera takes the second image, an edge of the second image aligns with the identified edge of the first image; and perform a set of analytic processes on a combined image from the first and second images.

<claims>
1. An apparatus for testing a biological specimen, the apparatus comprising: a receiving mechanism to receive a carrier, wherein the carrier includes a holding area, wherein the holding area is configured to carry or to be exposed to the biological specimen; a camera, the camera arranged to capture a plurality of images, including a first image and a second image, of the holding area; a positioning mechanism operable to adjust a relative location of the carrier to the camera; and a processor that is configured to utilize the camera module to: identify an edge of the first image; cause the positioning mechanism to adjust the relative location of the carrier to the camera in a manner such that, when the camera takes the second image, an edge of the second image aligns with the identified edge of the first image; and perform a set of analytic processes on an image that includes, at least partially, the first and second images to determine one or more properties of the biological specimen.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the manner the positioning mechanism adjusts the relative location of the carrier to the camera is such that, when viewed from the camera, the plurality of images is taken by the camera in a predetermined order.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the manner the positioning mechanism adjusts the relative location of the carrier to the camera is such that, when viewed from the camera, the plurality of images is taken by the camera sequentially and in a clockwise or counterclockwise order.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the manner the positioning mechanism adjusts the relative location of the carrier to the camera is such that, when viewed from the camera, the plurality of images is taken by the camera sequentially and in a progressive scan order.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the manner the positioning mechanism adjusts the relative location of the carrier to the camera is such that, when viewed from the camera, the plurality of images is taken by the camera in a random order.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: combine the first and the second images to form the combined image.
7. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the set of analytic processes on a combined image excludes an overlap portion of the first and second images.
8. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the one or more properties of the biological specimen include a cell count.
9. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the edge of the first image is a bottom side of the first image and the edge of the second image is a top side of the second image.
10. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the edge of the first image is a top side of the first image and the edge of the second image is a bottom side of the second image.
11. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the edge of the first image is a left side of the first image and the edge of the second image is a right side of the second image.
12. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the edge of the first image is a right side of the first image and the edge of the second image is a left side of the second image.
13. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein, in adjusting the relative location of the carrier to the camera, the positioning mechanism is to adjust the carrier to a next position for a subsequent image to be taken by the camera.
14. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein, in adjusting the relative location of the carrier to the camera, the positioning mechanism is to adjust the camera to a next position for a subsequent image to be taken by the camera.
15. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processor automatically adjusts the relative location of the carrier to the camera after the first image is taken by the camera.
16. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising: a casing, wherein said receiving mechanism, said camera module, and said processor are all enclosed within the casing, wherein a form factor of the casing is smaller than 27,000 cubic centimeters.
17. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the one or more properties of the biological specimen include concentration of the biological specimen.
18. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the biological specimen is semen.
19. A controller suitable for controlling an apparatus for testing a biological specimen, the apparatus comprising: a receiving mechanism to receive a carrier, wherein the carrier includes a holding area, wherein the holding area is configured to carry or to be exposed to the biological specimen; a camera, the camera arranged to capture a plurality of images, including a first image and a second image, of the holding area; and a positioning mechanism operable to adjust a relative location of the carrier to the camera; wherein the controller is configured to utilize the camera module to: identify an edge of the first image; cause the positioning mechanism to adjust the relative location of the carrier to the camera in a manner such that, when the camera takes the second image, an edge of the second image aligns with the identified edge of the first image; and perform a set of analytic processes on an image including, at least partially, the first and second images to determine one or more properties of the biological specimen.
20. The controller of claim 19, the apparatus further comprising: a casing, wherein said receiving mechanism, said camera module, and said controller are all enclosed within the casing, wherein a form factor of the casing is smaller than 27,000 cubic centimeters.
