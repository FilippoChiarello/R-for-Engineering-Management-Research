<claims>
1. A system, comprising: one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs) with at least one optical transmitter and receiver optically coupled to an optical network to communicate using broadband optical transmission, wherein the transmitter spreads transmitted data using a pseudorandom sequence over a network to communicate using broadband optical transmissions with the pseudorandom sequence without neighboring network interference and without radio interference; and a controller coupled to the LEDs, wherein the controller provides data responsive to a broadband optical request.
2. The system of claim 1, comprising a standardized electrical connector of a conventional light bulb or tube and an infrastructure for indoor location-based services.
3. The system of claim 1, comprising an audio transducer receiving music or sound data.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein each light bulb stores a local position or an indoor location.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the light bulb comprising a position grid.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the optical network communicates lighting profiles that incorporate time-based control with occupancy, daylighting, and manual control and wherein the controller integrates time-based lighting control with occupancy sensing control.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one electrical connector includes a pair of bi-pin end caps configured for engagement with a standard fluorescent tube receiving fixture, or an Edison screw connector for a bulb.
8. The system of claim 1, comprising a routing table storing an identifier that uniquely identifies a path through the network to a destination for a data packet, wherein when a transceiver initially connects to an optical network a unique identifier is broadcasted to other transceivers (nodes) within range for configuration of a local routing table, and forwarded by the nodes to other nodes within the network to make the network aware of the new connection.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein one or more LEDs detect motion or sound.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the light bulb comprises a receiver that receives an auxiliary signal generated from a source outside the bulb indicative of whether the one or more rooms in the building are in the occupied state or unoccupied state; and wherein the controller is operable to control the at least one LED in response to the auxiliary signal.
11. The system of claim 1, comprising a plurality of LEDs that transmit and receive at different wavelengths to transmit data in parallel over different wavelengths.
12. A method for visible light communications, comprising: optically communicating over a network using one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs) with a first mode to communicate using broadband optical transmissions, wherein the transmitter spreads transmitted data using a pseudorandom sequence over a network with a first mode to communicate position and a second mode to communicate using broadband optical transmissions with the pseudorandom sequence; and communicating the with the network using the optical transmitter and receiver without neighboring network interference and without radio interference.
13. The method of claim 12, comprising determining the local position or indoor position of the object using a mobile device coupled to the network.
14. The method of claim 12, comprising rendering audio visual content associated with the object.
