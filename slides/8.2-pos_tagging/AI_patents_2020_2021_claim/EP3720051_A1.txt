<title>
ANOMALY DETECTION AND TROUBLESHOOTING SYSTEM FOR A NETWORK USING MACHINE LEARNING AND/OR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
</title>

<abstract>
A method for anomaly detection and troubleshooting in a network includes parsing a network service descriptor (NSD) describing a network service (NS) to be deployed in the network. Monitoring data including time series of service-level metrics and resource-level metrics of network functions (NFs) of the NS are received from different domains of the network. Representations of the time series from the different domains are learned with a common dimensionality. An NS signature of the NS is computed as a cross-correlation matrix comprising cross-correlations between the service-level metrics and the resource-level metrics of the NFs. Embeddings of the NS signature are learned using a model and determining a reconstruction error of the model. It is determined whether the NS is anomalous based on the reconstruction error of the model. The NS is identified as a target for the troubleshooting in a case that the NS was determined to be anomalous.
