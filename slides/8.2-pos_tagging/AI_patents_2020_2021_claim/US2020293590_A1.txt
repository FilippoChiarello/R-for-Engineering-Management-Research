<title>
Computer-implemented Method and System for Age Classification of First Names
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method that receives a list of first names as input for classifying it into age distribution classes, classifying individual records into age brackets and providing an estimate of accuracy of such classification for each list entry. Features for classifying input list into age distribution classes are engineered based on birth counts of names by year, life tables and other features. Individual list entries are then classified into age brackets using birth counts for each year, life tables and classified list's age distribution as weights. Accuracy of age bracket classification is then estimated for each entry using training data validation results similar by age and name composition.
