Imaging system and imaging method
</title>

<abstract>
An imaging system includes an imaging optical system, an imaging device, an actuator, and control circuitry. The actuator changes a relative position of a plurality of pixel cells and an image of a subject. The pixel cells have variable sensitivity, and include a photoelectric converter and a charge accumulation region. The control circuitry sets the relative position to a first position, and also sets the sensitivity of each pixel cell to a first sensitivity. A first signal charge obtained at the photoelectric converter is accumulated in the charge accumulation region. The relative position is set to a second position different from the first position, and also the sensitivity of each pixel cell is set to a second sensitivity different from the first sensitivity. A second signal charge obtained at the photoelectric converter is accumulated in the charge accumulation region in addition to the first signal charge.
