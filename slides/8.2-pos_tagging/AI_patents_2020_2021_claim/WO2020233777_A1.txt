TECHNIQUE FOR PARAMETER CONVERSION BETWEEN A ROBOTIC DEVICE AND A CONTROLLER FOR THE ROBOTIC DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus for parameter transformation between a robotic device and a controller for the robotic device is presented. The apparatus is configured to receive at least one non-transformed parameter indicative of at least one of a position and a velocity of or for the robotic device, wherein the non-transformed parameter is received from the robotic device or the controller, respectively. The apparatus is further configured to transform the received non-transformed parameter to a transformed parameter using a transformation between an ideal parameter domain of the controller and a real parameter domain of the robotic device, the ideal parameter domain including ideal parameters processable by the controller and the real parameter domain including real parameters measurable at the robotic device and capable of deviating from the associated ideal parameters. The apparatus is further configured to transmit the transformed parameter to the other one of the robotic device and the controller, A method, a system, a computer-program product and a cloud computing system for parameter transformation are presented also.
