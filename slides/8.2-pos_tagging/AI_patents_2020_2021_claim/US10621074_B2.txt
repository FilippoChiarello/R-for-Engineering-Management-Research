<title>
Intelligent device selection for mobile application testing
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented facility is provided for intelligent mobile device selection for mobile application testing. The computer-implemented facility determines features of a new mobile application to be tested, and compares the features of the new mobile application with features of multiple known mobile applications to identify one or more known mobile applications with similar features. Based at least in part on automated analysis of user reviews of the one or the more known mobile applications operating in one or more types of mobile devices, the facility provides one or more risk scores for operation of the new mobile application in the one or more types of mobile devices. Further, based on the risk scores, a recommended set of mobile devices in which to test the new mobile application may be generated for use in testing the new mobile application.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: determining features of a new mobile application to be tested; comparing, by a processor, the features of the new mobile application to be tested with features of multiple known mobile applications to identify one or more known mobile applications with similar features; based at least in part on automated analysis of user reviews of the one or more known mobile applications operating in one or more types of mobile devices, providing one or more risk scores for operation of the new mobile application in the one or more types of mobile devices, wherein providing the one or more risk scores comprises generating a respective risk score for operating the new mobile application in each type of mobile device of the one or more types of mobile devices, the respective risk scores being determined based, at least in part, on automated analysis of user reviews of the one or more known mobile applications with similar features operating on that type of mobile device; using, by the processor, at least in part, the one or more risk scores in deciding in which types of mobile devices to test the operation of the new mobile application.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the one or more risk scores are determined based on one or more factors selected from a group consisting of: a degree of feature similarity between the new mobile application and the known mobile application with similar features, a number of defect instances reported for the known mobile application on the type of mobile device, a sentiment of user reviews of the known mobile device application on the type of mobile device, and a number of like or dislike reviews of the known mobile application on the type of mobile device.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising automatedly analyzing user reviews of the multiple known mobile device applications operating in the one or more types of mobile devices, and filtering the user reviews to identify any technical issue with a known mobile device application on a particular type of mobile device, the technical issue relating to using of the known mobile device application on that particular type of mobile device.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 3, wherein the automatedly analyzing is based on semantic analysis of the user reviews of the multiple known mobile applications.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the features of the new mobile application include features selected from the group consisting of operational requirements for the new mobile application and attributes of the new mobile application for a user.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising generating a recommended set of mobile devices to test the new mobile application on, the generating being based, at least in part, on the one or more risk scores.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 6, further comprising testing the new mobile application on the recommended set of mobile devices.
