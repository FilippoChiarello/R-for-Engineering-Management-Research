Information processing device, information processing system, information processing method, and storage medium
</title>

<abstract>
An information processing device according to the present invention includes: a cluster analyzer that determines a cluster identifier indicating a cluster that is a result of classifying an alert, receives a classification result of the alert, and generates alert information that is information including the alert, the cluster identifier, and the classification result; a rule generator that calculates a number of occurrence times of a pattern that is a combination of information and includes the cluster identifier, extracts a frequent pattern, generates a classification rule used in setting of the classification result, and updates a previously generated old classification rule with a newly generated classification rule; and a rule applicator that sets the classification result included in the alert information.

<claims>
1. An information processing device comprising: a memory storing instructions; and a processor configured to execute the instructions to control: a cluster analyzer that determines, based on communication information that is communicated information included in an alert, a cluster identifier indicating a cluster, among a plurality of clusters, that is a result of clustering the alert into one cluster among the plurality of clusters based on the communication information, receives a classification result that is a classification as to whether the alert is true detection or false detection, and generates alert information that includes the alert, the cluster identifier, and the classification result; a rule generator that calculates, for the alert information, a number of occurrence times of a pattern that is a combination of information included in the alert information and includes the cluster identifier, extracts a frequent pattern that is a pattern with a larger number of occurrence times than a predetermined threshold value, generates, based on the frequent pattern extracted, a classification rule used in setting or updating of the classification result associated with the alert, and updates a previously generated old classification rule with a newly generated classification rule; and a rule applicator that sets or updates the classification result included in the alert information, based on the classification rule, wherein the alert information further includes a detection time at which the alert is detected, and the rule generator selects the frequent pattern for use in generation of the classification rule, based on a detection time of the alert information matching with the frequent pattern.
2. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the cluster analyzer determines the cluster identifier based on similarity of the communication information.
3. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the rule generator generates the classification rule for the frequent pattern, based on the frequent pattern in which the classification result included in the frequent pattern is identical.
4. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the rule generator calculates a level of detail that is a degree of narrowness of an application range of the alert for the frequent pattern, and generates the classification rule for the frequent pattern having the level of detail larger than a predetermined threshold value.
5. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the classification rule further includes a valid flag indicating whether or not the classification rule is valid, the rule generator deletes the classification rule in which the valid flag is invalid, and does not delete but updates the classification rule in which the valid flag is valid, when updating the previously generated old classification rule with the newly generated classification rule, and the rule applicator sets or updates the classification result associated with the alert, based on the classification rule in which the valid flag is valid.
6. An information processing system comprising: the information processing device according to claim 1; and a presentation device that includes a memory storing instructions; and a processor configured to execute the instructions to control: an alert display that receives the alert information from the information processing device, and displays the received alert information, and an inputter that receives an input of the classification result for the displayed alert information, and transmits the received input to the information processing device.
7. The information processing system according to claim 6, wherein the presentation device further includes a rule display that receives the classification rule from the information processing device, and displays the received classification rule, and a rule approver that receives an instruction of valid or invalid for the displayed classification rule, and transmits the received instruction to the information processing device.
8. An information processing method comprising: determining, using an information processing device, based on communication information that is communicated information included in an alert, a cluster identifier indicating a cluster, among a plurality of clusters, that is a result of clustering the alert into one cluster among the plurality of clusters based on the communication information; receiving, using the information processing device, a classification result that is a classification as to whether the alert is true detection or false detection; generating, using the information processing device, alert information that includes the alert, the cluster identifier, and the classification result; calculating, using the information processing device, for the alert information, a number of occurrence times of a pattern that is a combination of information included in the alert information and includes the cluster identifier; extracting, using the information processing device, a frequent pattern that is a pattern with a larger number of occurrence times than a predetermined threshold value; generating, using the information processing device, based on the frequent pattern extracted, a classification rule used in setting or updating of the classification result associated with the alert; updating, using the information processing device, a previously generated old classification rule with a newly generated classification rule; and setting or updating, using the information processing device, the classification result included in the alert information, based on the classification rule, wherein the alert information further includes a detection time at which the alert is detected, and the frequent pattern for use in generation of the classification rule is selected based on a detection time of the alert information matching with the frequent pattern.
9. A computer readable non-transitory storage medium embodying a program causing a computer to perform a method, the method comprising: determining, based on communication information that is communicated information included in an alert, a cluster identifier indicating a cluster, among a plurality of clusters, that is a result of clustering the alert into one cluster among the plurality of clusters based on the communication information; receiving a classification result that is a classification as to whether the alert is true detection or false detection; generating alert information that includes the alert, the cluster identifier, and the classification result; calculating, for the alert information, a number of occurrence times of a pattern that is a combination of information included in the alert information and includes the cluster identifier; extracting a frequent pattern that is a pattern with a larger number of occurrence times than a predetermined threshold value; generating, based on the frequent pattern extracted, a classification rule used in setting or updating of the classification result associated with the alert; updating a previously generated old classification rule with a newly generated classification rule; and setting or updating the classification result included in the alert information, based on the classification rule, wherein the alert information further includes a detection time at which the alert is detected, and the frequent pattern for use in generation of the classification rule is selected based on a detection time of the alert information matching with the frequent pattern.
