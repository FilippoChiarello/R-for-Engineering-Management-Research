<title>
Computer vision system that provides an identification of movement pathway intensity
</title>

<abstract>
A computer vision system includes a camera that captures a plurality of image frames in a target field. A user interface is coupled to the camera. The user interface is configured to perform accelerated parallel computations in real-time on the plurality of image frames acquired by the camera. The system provides identification of intensity of movement pathways within a space.

<claims>
1. A computer vision system, comprising: a camera that captures a plurality of image frames in a target field of a space in a building, the system taking an image frame from the plurality of image frames and storing it locally; a processor coupled to the camera and configured to perform computations in real-time on the plurality of image frames acquired by the camera and relay outputs of the computations to a database coupled to a server, wherein only data extracted from each of a frame of the plurality of image frames is relayed to a system server; a user interface coupled to the camera; and wherein the system detects people, identification of their location and their movement in a field of view as well as their actual physical location in a space, and uses a data collection script running on the processor to relay data and error files to the server with the scrip deleting the local copy of the files once they have been posted to the server, the error files being created during an uploading process of image frames, the system including a timestamped error logging that allows an understanding of a source of errors and provides measures to fix the errors; and a memory management script running parallel to the data collection scripts that periodically checks the system for memory overflows.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the video feed captured by the camera and relayed to the processing unit for processing and automated analysis is not stored in the system.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the images are processed in real time.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein sysoccupants are extracted, and the next frames of the video overwrite those frames that were just processed.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein only data extracted from each frame is stored locally and/or relayed to system servers.
6. The system of claim 1, further comprising: extended USB ports.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the system creates a model of the conditions of an establishment that is informed by historical data, and runs scenarios of known intervention options through the model to assess intervention options based on their cost, impact, and any other factors of interest to the establishment owner, when current conditions are observed by the system to be of interest or concern, the system generates an intervention recommendation for the establishment that is based on modeled outcomes, when a modeled intervention is employed, the system observes the impact of the intervention on the conditions, and if the observed impact is different than the modeled impact, the system updates the model based on the observed data.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein an observed impact of the intervention is compared with a modeled impact of the action, and then updates the model.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the systems provide for a continual improvement to the model.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is configured to provide a recommendation that is model directed to at least one of: an interest; and concern of the establishment.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is configured to make one or more recommendations to a human.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the system is configured to provide a mechanism by which the human can take the one or more recommendations or other action.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the other action that is modeled to best address a condition of interest to an establishment.
14. The system of claim 1, wherein the system measures at least one: conditions post an intervention; and action, and compares an observed result to the modeled result.
15. The system of claim 1, wherein the system updates a model selected from at least one of: f machine learning and artificial intelligence.
16. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is used with at least one establishment selected from: retail; the food industry; and the beverage industry.
17. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is used relative to advertising costs of an establishment.
18. The system of claim 1, wherein the system provides near real time information relative to an establishment's current occupancy and provides information selected from at least one of: the ratio of an establishment's customers to employees; the number of establishment customers compared to establishment inventory; and the number of people who are entering and/or exiting an establishment.
19. The system of claim 1, wherein the system identifies a condition of interest with regard to occupant count, occupant activity, occupant location, occupant ratios, and/or some derivative or combination thereof and generates information summarizing the identified condition.
20. The system of claim 1, wherein the system sends out an alert to an establishment describing the identified condition of interest e.g. that the establishment capacity has dropped below a target capacity.
