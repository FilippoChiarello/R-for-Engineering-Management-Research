UNIVERSAL AND PERSONALIZED DISTRIBUTED DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A universal and personalized, distributed decision support system (100) comprising of: a script machine (101) that processes data of users' objects of the application servers (105) users by calling the library (108) of functions, a predictive model (102) which determines the shape and function coefficients adapted to the users of the application servers (105) and their objects, and personalized models (103) that communicate with the aforementioned system (100) through the middle layer software support (104) have, for the novelty, a feature of universality which is realized by the implementation of plug-in (109) for the various deployment of the system (100) through which the system 100 communicates with function libraries (108). Plug-in (109) is used to customize data and functions when calling the function library (108). Second feature of the system (100) is that it is personalized, which is reflected in the fact that the personalized models (103) contained in the system 100 are assigned to users and their objects, wherein personalized models (103) are formed by integrating said predictive model (102) with measurements acquired from objects of end users of application servers (105) and coefficients of the predictive models (102). The coefficients are adapted to the specified objects of the current users of the application servers (105). The user can be a human, an animal, a plant, a system, a device, an artificial intelligence, etc. while object can be a field, a vehicle, a human, etc., while variables are for example, humidity, pressure, temperature, result of the survey, etc. Different applications of the system (100) can be health, meteorology, agriculture, industry, etc. Application servers (105) reflect different deployments of the system (100).
