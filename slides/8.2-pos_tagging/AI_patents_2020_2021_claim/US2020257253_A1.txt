MANAGEMENT DEVICE AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A management device includes a data acquisition unit that collects data related to power consumption supplied to a plurality of industrial machines from at least a power supply facility, a preprocessing unit that creates power consumption data based on the collected data, a decision making unit that determines a behavior of allocating a predetermined total suspension time to the plurality of industrial machines with respect to a current state of power consumption by the plurality of industrial machines with reference to a learning model associating a value of a behavior of allocating the predetermined total suspension time to the plurality of industrial machines with a state of power consumption by the plurality of industrial machines based on power consumption data, and a suspension time allocation unit that allocates the suspension time to the plurality of industrial machines.

<claims>
1. A management device of a plurality of industrial machines supplied with power from a power supply facility, the management device comprising: a data acquisition unit for collecting data related to power consumption supplied to the plurality of industrial machines from at least the power supply facility; a preprocessing unit for creating power consumption data indicating information related to the power consumption supplied to the plurality of industrial machines during a predetermined time based on the data collected by the data acquisition unit; a learning model storage unit for storing a learning model associating a value of a behavior of allocating a predetermined total suspension time to the plurality of industrial machines with a state of power consumption by the plurality of industrial machines; a decision making unit for determining a behavior of allocating the predetermined total suspension time to the plurality of industrial machines with respect to a current state of power consumption by the plurality of industrial machines using the learning model stored in the learning model storage unit based on the power consumption data created by the preprocessing unit; and a suspension time allocation unit for allocating the total suspension time to the plurality of industrial machines based on determination by the decision making unit, and the management device decides the suspension time for each industrial machine to suspend an operation after a series of operations.
2. The management device according to claim 1, wherein the data acquisition unit further collects a suspension time after a series of operations of the industrial machine, the preprocessing unit creates the power consumption data, suspension time allocation data, and power consumption determination data, the management device includes a learning unit for generating a learning model, the suspension time allocation data indicates allocation of the predetermined total suspension time to the plurality of industrial machines after a state of power consumption indicated by the power consumption data is observed, the power consumption determination data indicates a determination result for power consumption within a predetermined time by the plurality of industrial machines in the case where the total suspension time indicated by the power consumption data is allocated after the power consumption indicated by the power consumption data is observed, and the learning model associates states of power consumption by the plurality of industrial machines with allocation behavior of the predetermined total suspension time to the plurality of industrial machines based on the power consumption data, the suspension time allocation data, and the power consumption determination data.
3. The management device according to claim 2, wherein the learning unit sets a plus reward when average power consumed by the plurality of industrial machines within the predetermined time is reduced and sets a minus reward when average power consumed by the plurality of industrial machines within the predetermined time is not reduced or when the average power increases, and generates the learning model based on a value of the reward.
4. The management device according to claim 1, wherein the learning model is a behavior value table associating and storing a value of a behavior of allocating the predetermined total suspension time to the plurality of industrial machines with a state of power consumption by the plurality of industrial machines.
5. The management device according to claim 1, wherein the learning model is a neural network having a multi-layer structure.
6. A management system in which a plurality of management devices according to claim 2 is connected to each other via a network, a learning result by the learning unit being allowed to be shared among the plurality of management devices.
