STORAGE SYSTEM AND STORAGE CONTROL METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A storage system that performs irreversible compression on time-series data using a compressor/decompressor based on machine learning calculates a statistical amount value of each of one or more kinds of statistical amounts based on one or more parameters in relation to original data (time-series data input to a compressor/decompressor) and calculates a statistical amount value of each of the one or more kinds of statistical amounts based on the one or more kinds of parameters in relation to decompressed data (time-series data output from the compressor/decompressor) corresponding to the original data. The machine learning of the compressor/decompressor is performed based on the statistical amount value calculated for each of the one or more kinds of statistical amounts in relation to the original data and the statistical amount value calculated for each of the one or more kinds of statistical amounts in relation to the decompressed data.
