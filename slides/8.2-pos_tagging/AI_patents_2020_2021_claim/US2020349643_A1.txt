SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FINANCING A PROPERTY PURCHASE
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for financing a property purchase are provided. A method includes receiving a financing request to finance a real-estate property; generating a first dataset including property-condition-related information; generating a second dataset including property-financial-related information; analyzing the information in the first dataset and the second dataset to determine eligibility of the received financing request; determining whether to grant or deny the received financing request based on the analysis; and sending either an approval or a denial.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for financing a real-estate property purchase, comprising: receiving a financing request to finance a real-estate property; generating a first dataset including property-condition-related information; generating a second dataset including property-financial-related information; analyzing the information in the first dataset and the second dataset to determine eligibility of the received financing request; determining whether to grant or deny the received financing request based on the analysis; and sending either an approval or a denial.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: collecting at least one applicant feedback response for at least one questionnaire; and analyzing the at least one applicant feedback response to further determine eligibility of the received financing request.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: analyzing the received financing request to determine an applicant's credit standing; and generating an aggregate weighted credit standing based on the applicant's credit standing.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising: comparing the aggregate weighted credit standing with a threshold value to further determine eligibility of the received financing request.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein determining whether to grant or deny the received financing request further includes: generating a hybrid metric based on the applicant's determined credit standing and the contents of the received at least one applicant feedback response.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein determining whether to grant or deny the received financing request further includes: configuring the hybrid metric to grant or deny requests including specific terms, keywords, values, or other pre-defined elements.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the first dataset includes at least a required repair report.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the first dataset further includes property locations, lot numbers, years of construction, zoning codes, current and previous owners, tenants, relevant deeds, and permits.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the second dataset includes property values, financing terms, and purchase dates.
10. A non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon instructions for causing a processing circuitry to execute a process, the process comprising: receiving a financing request to finance a real-estate property; generating a first dataset including property-condition-related information; generating a second dataset including property-financial-related information; analyzing the information in the first dataset and the second dataset to determine eligibility of the received financing request; determining whether to grant or deny the received financing request based on the analysis; and sending either an approval or a denial.
11. A system for financing a property purchase, comprising: a processing circuitry; and a memory, the memory containing instructions that, when executed by the processing circuitry, configure the system to: receive a financing request to finance a real-estate property; generate a first dataset including property-condition-related information; generate a second dataset including property-financial-related information; analyze the information in the first dataset and the second dataset to determine eligibility of the received financing request; determine whether to grant or deny the received financing request based on the analysis; and send either an approval or a denial.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the system is further configured to: collect at least one applicant feedback response for at least one questionnaire; and analyze the at least one applicant feedback response to further determine eligibility of the received financing request.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the system is further configured to: analyze the received financing request to determine an applicant's credit standing; and generate an aggregate weighted credit standing based on the applicant's credit standing.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the system is further configured to: compare the aggregate weighted credit standing with a threshold value to further determine eligibility of the received financing request.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the system is further configured to: generate a hybrid metric based on the applicant's determined credit standing and the contents of the received at least one applicant feedback response.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the system is further configured to: configure the hybrid metric to grant or deny requests including specific terms, keywords, values, or other pre-defined elements.
17. The system of claim 11, wherein the first dataset includes at least a required repair report.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the first dataset further includes property locations, lot numbers, years of construction, zoning codes, current and previous owners, tenants, relevant deeds, and permits.
19. The system of claim 11, wherein the second dataset includes property values, financing terms, and purchase dates.
