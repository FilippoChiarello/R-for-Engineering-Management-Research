<title>
Automatic Image Based Object Damage Assessment
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention provides a computer-based method for automatically evaluating validity and extent of at least one damaged object from image data, comprising the steps of: (a) receive image data comprising one or more images of at least one damaged object; (b) inspect any one of said one or more images for existing image alteration utilising an image alteration detection algorithm, and remove any image comprising image alterations from said one or more images; (c) identify and classify said at least one damaged object in any one of said one or more images, utilising at least one first machine learning algorithm; (d) detect at least one damaged area of said classified damaged object, utilising at least one second machine learning algorithm; (e) classify, quantitatively and/or qualitatively, an extent of damage of said at least one damaged area, utilising at least one third machine learning algorithm, and characteristic information of said damaged object and/or an undamaged object that is at least equivalent to said at least one damaged object; (f) provide a visual marker to said detected at least one damaged area in any one of said at least one or more images; (g) generate a predictive analysis to repair and/or replace said at least one damaged object, utilising a fourth machine learning algorithm and said classified extent of damage of the detected said at least one damaged area.

<claims>
1. A computer-based method for automatically evaluating validity and extent of at least one damaged object from image data, comprising the steps of: (a) receive image data comprising one or more images of at least one damaged object; (b) inspect any one of said one or more images for existing image alteration utilising an image alteration detection algorithm, and remove any image comprising image alterations from said one or more images; (c) identify and classify said at least one damaged object in any one of said one or more images, utilising at least one first machine learning algorithm; (d) detect at least one damaged area of said classified damaged object, utilising at least one second machine learning algorithm; (e) classify, quantitatively and/or qualitatively, an extent of damage of said at least one damaged area, utilising at least one third machine learning algorithm, and characteristic information of said damaged object and/or an undamaged object that is at least equivalent to said at least one damaged object; (f) provide a visual marker to said detected at least one damaged area in any one of said at least one or more images; (g) generate a predictive analysis to repair and/or replace said at least one damaged object, utilising a fourth machine learning algorithm and said classified extent of damage of the detected said at least one damaged area.
2. A computer-based method according to claim 1, wherein step (b) further includes accessing information related to said object from at least one database to detect fraudulent activities.
3. A computer-based method according to claim 2, wherein the assessment includes extracting key information from the image data and/or accessing information related to said object from at least one external or internal database, wherein the information extracted from the image and databases is utilised separately or in combination to detect fraudulent activities.
4. A computer-based method according to claim 3, wherein said key information comprises GPS data received from the image data.
5. A computer-based method according to claim 1, wherein said characteristic information of said damaged object and/or an undamaged object is provided from any one or any combination of a computer-based data storage, an external data storage and an external server via a communication network.
6. A computer-based method according to claim 1, wherein step (d) further includes generating image location information for each one of said at least one damaged area.
7. A computer-based method according to claim 6, wherein said image location information comprises the location of said damaged area with respect to said classified damaged object.
8. A computer-based method according to claim 1, wherein said at least one first, second, third and fourth machine learning algorithm includes any one or any combination of Deep Learning algorithms, artificial neural networks, statistical modelling, Computer Vision algorithms.
9. A computer-based method according to claim 1, wherein said visual marker comprises any one or any combination of shading, encircling, highlighting and color-coded mapping.
10. A computer-based method according to claim 1, wherein said predictive analysis comprises any one or any combination of: a prediction on the reparability of said at least one damaged object; a prediction on the time to repair said at least one damaged object; a prediction on the costs to repair said at least one damaged object; a list of detected said at least one damaged area and associated parts of said at least one damaged object; qualitative assessment of damage detected on said at least one damaged object; a prediction on association of detected damaged areas to a single event; a prediction on image alteration, and a prediction of the likelihood of fraud.
11. A computer-readable storage medium comprising computer-executable program instructions stored thereon that when executed by a computer processor perform a method according to claim 10.
12. A computer system comprising computer-executable program instructions implemented thereon that when executed by a computer processor perform a method according to claim 10.
