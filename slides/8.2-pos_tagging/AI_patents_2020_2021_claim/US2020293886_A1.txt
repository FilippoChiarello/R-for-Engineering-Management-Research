AUTHENTICATION METHOD AND APPARATUS WITH TRANSFORMATION MODEL
</title>

<abstract>
An authentication method and apparatus using a transformation model are disclosed. The authentication method includes generating, at a first apparatus, a first enrolled feature based on a first feature extractor, obtaining a second enrolled feature to which the first enrolled feature is transformed, determining an input feature by extracting a feature from input data with a second feature extractor different from the first feature extractor, and performing an authentication based on the second enrolled feature and the input feature.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A processor implemented authentication method, comprising: obtaining a second enrolled feature to which a first enrolled feature generated based on a first feature extractor is transformed; determining an input feature by extracting a feature from input data with a second feature extractor different from the first feature extractor; and performing an authentication based on the second enrolled feature and the input feature.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the obtaining comprises transforming the first enrolled feature to the second enrolled feature with a transformation model.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the obtaining comprises receiving, from another apparatus, the second enrolled feature to which the first enrolled feature is transformed.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the second feature extractor is an updated version of the first feature extractor.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the second enrolled feature is obtained based on a transformation model.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the transformation model includes a structural element that corresponds to a difference between a structure of the first feature extractor and a structure of the second feature extractor.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein the first feature extractor is pretrained to output first output data in response to an input of first input data, the second feature extractor is pretrained to output second output data in response to an input of the first input data, and the transformation model is pretrained to output the second output data in response to an input of the first output data.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the first enrolled feature includes first sub-enrolled features, and the second enrolled feature includes second sub-enrolled features to which the first sub-enrolled features are transformed.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising: discarding at least a portion of the second sub-enrolled features based on suitabilities of the second sub-enrolled features.
10. The method of claim 8, further comprising: discarding at least a portion of the second sub-enrolled features based on a similarity between the second sub-enrolled features.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the discarding comprises discarding at least one of the second sub-enrolled features based on a second threshold and similarities between the at least one second sub-enrolled feature and remaining second sub-enrolled features.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the performing comprises performing the authentication based on a first threshold and a similarity between the second enrolled feature and the input feature, wherein the first threshold is equal to the second threshold.
13. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform the machine learning based authentication method of claim 1.
14. An authentication apparatus comprising: one or more processors configured to: obtain a second enrolled feature to which a first enrolled feature generated based on a first feature extractor is transformed; determine an input feature by extracting a feature from input data with a second feature extractor different from the first feature extractor; and perform an authentication based on the second enrolled feature and the input feature.
15. The apparatus of claim 14, wherein the second enrolled feature is obtained based on a transformation model.
16. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the transformation model includes a structural element that corresponds to a difference between a structure of the first feature extractor and a structure of the second feature extractor.
17. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the first feature extractor is pretrained to output first output data in response to an input of first input data, the second feature extractor is pretrained to output second output data in response to an input of the first input data, and the transformation model is pretrained to output the second output data in response to an input of the first output data.
18. The apparatus of claim 14, wherein the first enrolled feature includes first sub-enrolled features, and the second enrolled feature includes second sub-enrolled features to which the first sub-enrolled features are transformed.
19. The apparatus of claim 18, wherein the one or more processors are configured to discard at least a portion of the second sub-enrolled features based on a similarity between the second sub-enrolled features.
20. The apparatus of claim 19, wherein the one or more processors are configured to discard one of the second sub-enrolled features based on a threshold and similarities between the one second sub-enrolled feature and the remaining second sub-enrolled features.
21. The apparatus of claim 14, further comprising a memory storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, configure the one or more processors to perform the generating of the first enrolled feature, the obtaining of the second enrolled feature, the determining of the input feature, and the performing of the authentication.
