CLASSIFICATION OF SYNTHETIC DATA TASKS AND ORCHESTRATION OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION
</title>

<abstract>
Various techniques are described for classifying synthetic data tasks and orchestrating a resource allocation between groups of eligible resources for processing the synthetic data tasks. Received synthetic data tasks can be classified by identifying a task category and a corresponding group of eligible resources (e.g., processors) for processing synthetic data tasks in the task category. For example, synthetic data tasks can include generation of source assets, ingestion of source assets, identification of variation parameters, variation of variation parameters, and creation of synthetic data. Certain categories of synthetic data tasks can be classified for processing with a particular group of eligible resources. For example, tasks to ingest synthetic data assets can be classified for processing on a CPU only, while a task to create synthetic data assets can be classified for processing on a GPU only. The synthetic data tasks can be queued and routed for processing by an eligible resource.

<claims>
1. A computer system comprising:
one or more hardware processors and memory configured to provide computer program instructions to the one or more hardware processors;
a task classifier configured to use the one or more hardware processors to: receive, from a distributed Synthetic Data as a Service (SDaaS) interface, a request to perform a synthetic data task; and
identify a task category of the synthetic data task and a corresponding group of eligible processors for executing synthetic data tasks in the task category, wherein the group of eligible processors is selected from a plurality of groups comprising a group of only CPUs, a group of only GPUs, and a group of CPUs and GPUs; and
a scheduler configured to use the one or more hardware processors to route the synthetic data task to a first processor in the group of eligible processors.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the task classifier is further configured to queue the synthetic data task into a queue corresponding to the group of eligible processors, and wherein the scheduler is further configured to select the synthetic data task for assignment from the queue giving priority to requests to create synthetic data.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the task classifier is further configured to derive, from the request, a plurality of synthetic data tasks that batch creation of synthetic data assets.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the scheduler is further configured to route the synthetic data task based on a monitoring signal indicating availability of the first processor.
5. One or more computer storage media storing computer-useable instructions that, when used by one or more computing devices, cause the one or more computing devices to perform operations comprising:
receiving, from a distributed Synthetic Data as a Service (SDaaS) interface, a request to perform a synthetic data task;
orchestrating a resource allocation by:
identifying a corresponding category of eligible resource for processing the synthetic data task; and
routing the synthetic data task to a first resource in the category of eligible resource; and executing the synthetic data task on the first resource.
6. The media of claim 5, wherein identifying a corresponding category of eligible resource comprises identifying a task category of the synthetic data task and identifying the corresponding category of eligible resource for processing synthetic data tasks in the task category.
7. The media of claim 5, wherein the synthetic data task comprises a task to perform at least one of generation of source assets, ingestion of source assets, identification of variation parameters, variation of variation parameters, or creation of synthetic data.
8. The media of claim 5, wherein identifying a corresponding category of eligible resource comprises classifying a task to ingest synthetic data assets as eligible for processing on a CPU only or classifying a task to create synthetic data assets as eligible for processing on a GPU only.
9. The media of claim 5, wherein the category of eligible resource is selected from a plurality of categories comprising CPU only, GPU only, and either CPU or GPU.
10. A method for executing synthetic data tasks, the method comprising: receiving, from a distributed Synthetic Data as a Service (SDaaS) interface, a request to perform a synthetic data task;
orchestrating a resource allocation between groups of processors with different architectures by:
identifying, from the groups, a corresponding group of eligible processors for executing the synthetic data task; and
assigning the synthetic data task to a first processor in the group of eligible processors; and
executing the synthetic data task on the first processor.
