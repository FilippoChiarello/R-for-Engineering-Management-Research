METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR FACILITATING APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE COMMUNICATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
Method and systems for facilitating communications using application programming interfaces ("APIs") by interpreting a received command based on the command and an image of the user interface that was displayed on a display screen when the command was received.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for facilitating communications using application programming interfaces ("APIs"), the method comprising: generating for display, by control circuitry, a user interface on a display screen; while the user interface is displayed, receiving, by the control circuitry, a command; in response to receiving the command, capturing, by the control circuitry, an image of the user interface; generating an application programming interface ("API") request for interpreting the command, wherein the API request includes the image; caching, by the control circuitry, the image in the API request; and receiving, by the control circuitry, an API response to the API request, wherein the API response is customized based on the image.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the API response is customized based on the image by: determining an object in the image; determining a context for the user interface based on the object; and generating the API response based on the context.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the object in the image is determined by: determining boundaries of objects in the image; matching the boundaries of objects to a user interface template of a plurality of user interface templates, wherein each of the plurality of user interface templates corresponds to a respective context; and determining the context for the user interface based on the respective context for the user interface template.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the API response is customized based on the image by: determining an object in the image; determining a position of the object in the user interface; and generating the API response based on the position.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the API response is customized based on the image by: determining an object in the image; determining a word corresponding to the object in the user interface; and generating the API response based on the word.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the API response is customized based on the image by interpreting the command based on an object in the image.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the command is a vocal search command, and the API request is for a voice recognition application.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising transmitting, by the control circuitry, the API request from a first device to a second device.
9. (canceled)
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the image is captured prior to modifying the user interface in response to the command.
11. A system for facilitating communications using application programming interfaces ("APIs"), the system comprising: control circuitry configured to: generate for display a user interface on a display screen; receive a command while the user interface is displayed; capture an image of the user interface in response to receiving the command; generate an application programming interface ("API") request for interpreting the command, wherein the API request includes the image; cache the image in the API request; and input circuitry configured to: receive an API response to the API request, wherein the API response is customized based the image.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the control circuitry is further configured to: determine an object in the image; determine a context for the user interface based on the object; and generate the API response based on the context.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the control circuitry is further configured to: determine boundaries of objects in the image; match the boundaries of objects to a user interface template of a plurality of user interface templates, wherein each of the plurality of user interface templates corresponds to a respective context; and determine the context for the user interface based on the respective context for the user interface template.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the control circuitry is further configured to: determine an object in the image; determine a position of the object in the user interface; and generate the API response based on the position.
15. The system of claim 11, wherein the control circuitry is further configured to: determine an object in the image; determine a word corresponding to the object in the user interface; and generate the API response based on the word.
16. The system of claim 11, wherein the API response is customized based on the image by interpreting the command based on an object in the image.
17. The system of claim 11, wherein the command is a vocal search command, and the API request is for a voice recognition application.
18. The system of claim 11, wherein the input circuitry is further configured to transmit the API request from a first device to a second device.
19. (canceled)
20. The system of claim 11, wherein the image is captured prior to modifying the user interface in response to the command.
21. 21-50. (canceled)
51. The method of claim 1, further comprising generating a command response based on the command and the image.
52. The system of claim 11, wherein the control circuitry is further configured to: generate a command response based on the command and the image.
