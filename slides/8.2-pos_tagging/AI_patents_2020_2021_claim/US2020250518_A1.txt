<title>
Processing Matrix Operations for Rate Limited Systems
</title>

<abstract>
Data to be processed includes vector element values of an input vector and matrix element values of a model matrix associated with a neural network model. A vector-matrix multiplication module receives a set of matrix element values for performing a vector-matrix multiplication operation. Processing the data includes computing a plurality of intermediate vectors based on element-wise vector multiplication between different subsets of the vector element values and different respective pre-processing vectors. The vector-matrix multiplication module is loaded with a core matrix, and the input vector is multiplied by the model matrix based on separately multiplying each of the intermediate vectors by the loaded core matrix.
