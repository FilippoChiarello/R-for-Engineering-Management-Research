METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR FACILITATING USER COLLABORATION
</title>

<abstract>
A processor-based system for routing data on a collaboration platform over a network is provided. The system has a web layer in communication with at least a server and at least a user interface associated with a user, a user presence module residing on the server and in communication with the web layer, a threaded discussion module residing on the server and in communication with the web layer, a document editor module residing on the server and in communication with the web layer, and an audio-visual module residing on the server and in communication with the web layer, wherein the audio-visual module allows the users to share the at least one user interface for viewing content, each other, or both.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A processor-based system for routing data on a collaboration platform over a network, the processor-based system comprising: a web layer in communication with at least a server and at least and a user interface associated with at least a user; a user presence module residing on the server and in communication with the web layer, wherein the user presence module detects which of the users is logged into the collaboration platform; a threaded discussion module residing on the server and in communication with the web layer, wherein the threaded discussion module allows the users to set up a channel on the collaboration platform and post content to facilitate collaboration amongst the users; a document editor module residing on the server and in communication with the web layer, wherein the document editor module allows the users to edit the content in real time and to sync each user in the channel to view and edit the content in real time on the collaboration platform; and an audio-visual module residing on the server and in communication with the web layer, wherein the audio-visual module allows the users to share the at least one user interface for viewing content, each other's user interface, or both.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising: a document editor module residing on the server and in communication with the web layer, wherein the document editor module allows the users on the channel to edit the content using co-browsing functionality and to further sync the content in real-time to all other users; and a file management module residing on the server and in communication with the web layer, wherein the file management module allows the users to sort and share files.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the user presence module comprises a plurality of sub-modules, wherein the sub-modules comprise: a user focus module in communication with the document editor; a co-browsing module in communication with the document editor, wherein the co-browsing module and user focus module, together, tracks user behavior to optimize a collaboration platform load, wherein the co-browsing module comprises a first artificial intelligence component to gather user use data and automatically learn and improve a balance of load on the collaboration platform; a real-time sync module in communication with the document editor, wherein the real-time sync module syncs users to the content; an audio-video streaming module in communication with the document editor, wherein the audio-video streaming module allows users to communicate in audio-video stream to discuss the content, view the content, or both.
4. The system of claim 1, further comprising: a universal login module that allows the users to register for the user presence module, the threaded discussion module, the document editor module, and audio-visual module with a single login in a wrapper.
5. The system of claim 3, further comprising: a load balancer in communication with: a messaging and presence protocol module to allow the users to send messages to other users; a document editor and management platform to allow the users to edit documents; a file manager platform to allow the users to manage files; a videoconference and messaging platform that allows the users to videoconference and message; wherein the load balancer sends resources to any of the modules that requires additional resources to optimize the load on the collaboration platform using a second artificial intelligence component.
6. A processor-based method for routing data on a collaboration platform over a network, the processor-based method comprising: providing a web layer in communication with at least a server and at least a user interface associated with at least a user; detecting which of the users is logged into the collaboration platform via a user presence module residing on the server and in communication with the web layer; setting up a channel on the collaboration platform via a threaded discussion module residing on the server and in communication with the web layer based on a request from the user; receiving an upload of content from the user; receiving and outputting edits from the users in real time and syncing each user in the channel to view and edit the content in real time on the collaboration platform; allowing users to share the at least one user interface for viewing content, each other, or both via an audio video module.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising: receiving requests from users on the channel to edit the content using co-browsing functionality and further syncing the content in real-time to all other users; and managing and sorting files for the users based on user inputs.
8. The method of claim 6, further comprising: tracking user behavior to optimize the collaboration platform load, using a co-browsing module having a first artificial intelligence component to gather user use data and automatically learn and improve a balance of load on the collaboration platform; and automatically syncing content to the platform.
9. The method of claim 6, further comprising: providing a universal login module that allows the users to register for the user presence module, the threaded discussion module, the document editor module, and audio-visual module with a single login over a wrapper.
10. The method of claim 8, further comprising: balancing a load on the platform by sending resources to any of the modules that requires additional resources to optimize load on the collaboration platform using a second artificial intelligence component.
