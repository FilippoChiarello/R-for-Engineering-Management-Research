<title>
Compute Platform Optimization Across Heterogeneous Hardware in a Distributed Computing Environment
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for an optimization service of a service provider network to help optimize the selection, configuration, and utilization, of virtual machine (VM) instance types to support workloads on behalf of users. The optimization service may implement the techniques described herein at various stages in a life cycle of a workload to help optimize the performance of the workload, and reduce underutilization of computing resources. For example, the optimization service may perform techniques to help new users select an optimized VM instance type on which to initially launch their workload. Further, the optimization service may monitor a workload for the life of the workload, and determine new VM instance types, and/or configuration modifications, that optimize the performance of the workload. The optimization service may provide recommendations to users that help improve performance of their workloads, and that also increase the aggregate utilization of computing resources of the service provider network.
