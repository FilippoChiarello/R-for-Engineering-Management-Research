<title>
Method for treating a surface
</title>

<abstract>
Method for treating a surface includes: automatically evaluating at least one digital image which includes the target surface; determining the nature of the target surface according to the evaluation of the at least one digital image; determining at least one available treatment implement according to the evaluation of the at least one image; determining the nature of the surface treatment according to the evaluation of the at least one image; automatically determining a use of the determined treatment implement in the determined treatment of the determined surface; and providing information analogous to the determined use of the treatment implement.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for treating a target surface, the method comprising steps of: a. using machine learning in evaluating at least one digital image including the target surface; b. determining the nature of the target surface according to the evaluation of the at least one image; c. determining at least one available treatment implement according to the evaluation of the at least one image; d. determining the nature of the surface treatment according to the evaluation of the at least one image; e. using machine learning to determine a use of the determined implement in the determined treatment of the determined surface; f. altering performance characteristics of the implement or providing information analogous to the determined use.
2. The method according to claim 1 wherein the step of determining the nature of the target surface comprises determining one or more properties of the surface associated with surface treatments.
3. The method according to claim 1 wherein the step of determining at least one available treatment implements comprises determining the presence of a hand-held surface treatment appliance.
4. The method according to claim 1 wherein the step of determining the nature of the surface treatment comprises evaluating the nature of the determined surface and the nature of the determined implement.
5. The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of determining one or more properties of a treatment practitioner according to the evaluation of the at least one image.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the step of determining the nature of the surface treatment comprises using machine learning in evaluating at least one of: the nature of the surface, the implement, and the practitioner.
7. The method according to claim 1 further comprising the step of providing information regarding implements associated with a treatment of the determined target surface, such implements not determined to be present in the evaluation of the one or more images.
8. The method according to claim 1 further comprising the step of determining one or more environmental properties according to the evaluation of the one or more images together with at least one additional data source.
9. The method according to claim 1 wherein the step of providing information comprises providing cues analogous to the spatial interaction between the determined implement and the determined surface.
10. The method according to claim 1 wherein the step of providing information comprises providing information analogous to the temporal interaction of the determined implement and the determined surface.
11. The method according to claim 1 wherein the step of providing information comprises providing information through an alteration of a property of the determined implement.
12. The method according to claim 1 further comprising the steps of: g. tracking an initial determined treatment of a determined target surface; h. evaluating the initial determined treatment according to the provided information; and i. altering the provided information according to a machine learning evaluation of the tracked initial determined treatment.
13. The method according to claim 1 further comprising the steps of: j. tracking an initial determined treatment of a determined target surface; k. tracking at least one subsequent determined treatment of the same determined treatment surface; l. using machine learning in evaluating the combination of tracked determined treatments of the determined target surface; and m. providing information analogous to the determined treatment of the determined target surface according to the evaluation of the combination of tracked determined treatments.
14. The method according to claim 13 wherein the step of machine learning in evaluating the combination of tracked determined treatments of the determined target surface comprises evaluating the practitioner in the combination.
15. The method according to claim 13 wherein the step of machine learning in evaluating the combination of tracked determined treatments of the determined target surface comprises evaluating the implement in the combination.
16. The method according to claim 13 wherein the step of machine learning in evaluating the combination of tracked determined treatments of the determined target surface comprises evaluating the surface in the combination.
17. The method according to claim 1 further comprising the step of altering a performance characteristic of the implement.
18. The method according to claim 1 wherein the step of providing information comprises providing information associated with a clustered population.
