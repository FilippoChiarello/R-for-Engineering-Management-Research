VEHICLE CONTROL APPARATUS, VEHICLE CONTROL METHOD, AND STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle control apparatus includes a recognizer which recognize a surrounding situation of a host vehicle, and a driving controller which controls acceleration/deceleration of the host vehicle on the basis of a recognition result of the recognizer, wherein the driving controller causes the host vehicle to operate in any of a first driving state and a second driving state which has a higher rate of automation or fewer tasks requested with respect to an occupant than the first driving state, and changes a driving state of the host vehicle to the second driving state on the basis of at least one of presence or absence of a recognized following vehicle positioned behind the host vehicle and a following vehicle detection situation when the host vehicle is operating in the first driving state.

<claims>
1. A vehicle control apparatus comprising: a recognizer which recognize a surrounding situation of a host vehicle; and a driving controller which controls acceleration/deceleration of the host vehicle on the basis of a recognition result of the recognizer, wherein the driving controller causes the host vehicle to operate in any of a first driving state and a second driving state which has a higher rate of automation or fewer tasks requested with respect to an occupant than the first driving state, and changes a driving state of the host vehicle to the second driving state on the basis of at least one of presence or absence of a recognized following vehicle positioned behind the host vehicle and a following vehicle detection situation when the host vehicle is operating in the first driving state.
2. The vehicle control apparatus according to claim 1, wherein, when the host vehicle is operating in the first driving state, the driving controller changes the first driving state to the second driving state when a vehicle-to-vehicle distance between the following vehicle recognized by the recognizer and the host vehicle is equal to or less than a first predetermined distance.
3. The vehicle control apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the driving controller changes the driving state from the first driving state to the second driving state when a speed of the host vehicle is less than a predetermined speed, and the recognizer executes a process of recognizing the following vehicle when the host vehicle is operating in the first driving state.
4. The vehicle control apparatus according to claim 1, wherein, when the following vehicle is not recognized by the recognizer in the second driving state, the driving controller changes the driving state to the first driving state.
5. The vehicle control apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the driving controller changes the driving state to the first driving state when the vehicle-to-vehicle distance between the following vehicle recognized by the recognizer and the host vehicle is equal to or greater than a second predetermined distance or a distance between a travel path through which the following vehicle recognized by the recognizer travels and a travel path through which the host vehicle travels in a vehicle width direction is equal to or greater than a third predetermined distance.
6. The vehicle control apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the second predetermined distance is a value depending on a travel speed of the host vehicle.
7. The vehicle control apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the driving controller changes the driving state to the second driving state when the following vehicle recognized by the recognizer is of a predetermined type in the first driving state and prevents change to the second driving state when the following vehicle recognized by the recognizer is not of the predetermined type.
8. The vehicle control apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the driving controller prevents change to the second driving state when a distance between the host vehicle and the following vehicle in the vehicle width direction is equal to or greater than a fourth predetermined distance in the first driving state.
9. The vehicle control apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the driving controller continues the second driving state when a plurality of following vehicles are recognized by the recognizer and a first following vehicle closest to the host vehicle from among the plurality of following vehicles and a second following vehicle positioned behind the first following vehicle are recognized in the second driving state, and changes the driving state to the first driving state when the first following vehicle is recognized by the recognizer and the second following vehicle is not recognized.
10. A vehicle control method, using a computer, comprising: recognizing a surrounding situation of a host vehicle; controlling acceleration/deceleration of the host vehicle on the basis of a recognition result of the recognizer; causing the host vehicle to operate in any of a first driving state and a second driving state which has a higher rate of automation or fewer tasks requested with respect to an occupant than the first driving state; and changing a driving state of the host vehicle to the second driving state on the basis of at least one of presence or absence of a recognized following vehicle positioned behind the host vehicle and a following vehicle detection situation when the host vehicle is operating in the first driving state.
11. A computer-readable non-transitory storage medium causing a computer to: recognize a surrounding situation of a host vehicle; control acceleration/deceleration of the host vehicle on the basis of a recognition result of the recognizer; cause the host vehicle to operate in any of a first driving state and a second driving state which has a higher rate of automation or fewer tasks requested with respect to an occupant than the first driving state; and change a driving state of the host vehicle to the second driving state on the basis of at least one of presence or absence of a recognized following vehicle positioned behind the host vehicle and a following vehicle detection situation when the host vehicle is operating in the first driving state.
