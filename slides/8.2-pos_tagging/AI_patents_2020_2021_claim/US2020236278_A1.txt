<title>
PANORAMIC VIRTUAL REALITY FRAMEWORK PROVIDING A DYNAMIC USER EXPERIENCE
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus, system, and method are described for providing real-time capture, processing, and distribution of panoramic virtual reality (VR) content of a live event. One or more triggering events are identified and used to generate graphics and/or audio on client VR devices. For example, one embodiment of a method comprises: capturing video of an event at an event venue with a plurality of cameras to produce a corresponding plurality of video streams; generating a virtual reality (VR) stream based on the plurality of video streams; transmitting the VR stream to a plurality of client VR devices, wherein the client VR devices are to render VR environments based on the VR stream; detecting a triggering event during the event; and transmitting an indication of the triggering event to the plurality of client VR devices, wherein a first client VR device is to generate first event-based graphics and/or first event-based audio in accordance with the indication.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising: capturing video of an event at an event venue with a plurality of cameras to produce a corresponding plurality of video streams; generating a virtual reality (VR) stream based on the plurality of video streams; transmitting the VR stream to a plurality of client VR devices, wherein the client VR devices are to render VR environments based on the VR stream; detecting a triggering event during the event; and transmitting an indication of the triggering event to the plurality of client VR devices, wherein a first client VR device is to generate first event-based graphics and/or first event-based audio within a first VR environment in accordance with the indication.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the event comprises a sporting event and wherein the triggering event comprises a scoring event by a first team participating in the event.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein the plurality of client VR devices are each configurable to generate different event-based graphics and/or event-based audio responsive to the indication of the triggering event.
4. The method of claim 3 wherein a second client VR device is to generate second event-based graphics and/or event-based audio in accordance with the indication, the second event-based graphics and/or event-based audio different from the first event-based graphics and/or event-based audio.
5. The method of claim 3 wherein each client VR device is to be configured based on determined preferences of a user of the client VR device.
6. The method of claim 5 wherein the preferences of the user comprise an indication of sporting teams which the user follows.
7. The method of claim 6 wherein the first event-based graphics and/or first event-based audio comprises celebratory graphics and/or audio based on the scoring event by a first team.
8. A machine-readable medium having program code stored thereon which, when executed by a machine, causes the machine to perform the operations of: capturing video of an event at an event venue with a plurality of cameras to produce a corresponding plurality of video streams; generating a virtual reality (VR) stream based on the plurality of video streams; transmitting the VR stream to a plurality of client VR devices, wherein the client VR devices are to render VR environments based on the VR stream; detecting a triggering event during the event; transmitting an indication of the triggering event to the plurality of client VR devices, wherein a first client VR device is to generate first event-based graphics and/or first event-based audio within a first VR environment in accordance with the indication.
9. The machine-readable medium of claim 8 wherein the event comprises a sporting event and wherein the triggering event comprises a scoring event by a first team participating in the event.
10. The machine-readable medium of claim 9 wherein the plurality of client VR devices are each configurable to generate different event-based graphics and/or event-based audio responsive to the indication of the triggering event.
11. The machine-readable medium of claim 10 wherein a second client VR device is to generate second event-based graphics and/or event-based audio in accordance with the indication, the second event-based graphics and/or event-based audio different from the first event-based graphics and/or event-based audio.
12. The machine-readable medium of claim 10 wherein each client VR device is to be configured based on determined preferences of a user of the client VR device.
13. The machine-readable medium of claim 12 wherein the preferences of the user comprise an indication of sporting teams which the user follows.
14. The machine-readable medium of claim 13 wherein the first event-based graphics and/or first event-based audio comprises celebratory graphics and/or audio based on the scoring event by a first team.
15. An apparatus comprising: a memory to store program code including virtual reality (VR) program code; a processor to execute the program code to perform a plurality of operations comprising: receiving a virtual reality (VR) video stream comprising video of an event; rendering a VR environment based on the VR stream; receiving an indication of a triggering event during the event; and generating first event-based graphics and/or first event-based audio within the VR environment in accordance with the indication.
16. The apparatus of claim 15 wherein the event comprises a sporting event and wherein the triggering event comprises a scoring event by a first team participating in the event.
17. The apparatus of claim 16 wherein the plurality of client VR devices are each configurable to generate different event-based graphics and/or event-based audio responsive to the indication of the triggering event.
18. The apparatus of claim 17 wherein a second client VR device is to generate second event-based graphics and/or event-based audio in accordance with the indication, the second event-based graphics and/or event-based audio different from the first event-based graphics and/or event-based audio.
19. The apparatus of claim 17 wherein each client VR device is to be configured based on determined preferences of a user of the client VR device.
20. The apparatus of claim 19 wherein the preferences of the user comprise an indication of sporting teams which the user follows.
21. The apparatus of claim 20 wherein the first event-based graphics and/or first event-based audio comprises celebratory graphics and/or audio based on the scoring event by a first team.
