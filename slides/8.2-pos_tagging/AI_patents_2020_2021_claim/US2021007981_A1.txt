METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR MAKING PERSONALIZED NUTRITIONAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS USING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING
</title>

<abstract>
The presently disclosed subject matter is directed to a system and method of preparing personalized nutritional and/or pharmaceutical formulations using additive manufacturing technology. Active pharmaceutical or dietary supplement ingredients are suspended in thixotropic stable carrier medias. The thixotropic suspensions are deposited onto a surface of a solid substrate, which can be a snack bar or small wafer used as a mechanical carrier. The disclosed system enables each additive active ingredient to be variably dosed based on a formula that is determined for each specific individual and manufactured on demand. Once the active ingredients are deposited on substrate, the entire assembly can be enrobed with one or more edible solid coatings to seal the active ingredients and provide taste-masking agent characteristics to the assembly.

<claims>
1. A solid assembly for oral consumption, the assembly comprising: a substrate defining one or more depressions; one or more suspensions deposited within the depressions of the solid substrate, wherein each suspension comprises a homogenous dispersion of one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and a carrier, wherein each suspension is viscous and/or thixotropic; one or more coatings applied over one or more surfaces of the solid substrate; wherein each API is variably dosed based on a formula that is determined for each subject consuming the solid assembly.
2. The solid assembly of claim 1, wherein the substrate is an excipient that is selected from one or more fillers, pH adjusting agents, preservatives, anti-adhesives, plasticizers, opacifiers, coloring agents, pigments, surfactants, diluents, anti-foaming agents, lubricants, binders, granulating aids, taste modifying agents, and glidants.
3. The solid assembly of claim 1, wherein the depressions are configured as a plurality of longitudinal channels.
4. The solid assembly of claim 1, wherein the APIs are selected from one or more pharmaceuticals, vitamins, food supplements, or combinations thereof.
5. The solid assembly of claim 4, wherein the one or more pharmaceuticals are selected from compounds used for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, or cure of a chronic condition.
6. The solid assembly of claim 4, wherein the one or more vitamins are selected from thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, biotin, folic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, lipoic acid, vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, and derivatives thereof.
7. The solid assembly of claim 4, wherein the one or more food supplements are selected from iron, calcium, selenium, iodine, magnesium, BHT, BHA, flavonoids, beta carotene, polyphenol, glutathione, echinacea, flaxseed, gingko, turmeric, L-arginine, L-glutathione, L-lysine, and combinations thereof.
8. The solid assembly of claim 1, wherein the one or more APIs are encapsulated into microspheres.
9. The solid assembly of claim 8, wherein the microspheres are selected from reservoir-type microspheres, matrix-type microspheres, or combinations of reservoir-type and matrix-type microspheres.
10. The solid assembly of claim 8, wherein the microspheres have a size of about 1200 μm or less.
11. The solid assembly of claim 1, wherein the carrier is selected from gelatin, polymeric glycosaminoglycan, agar, carrageenan, alginate, natural gum, carboxymethyl cellulose, xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol, glycerin, pectin, dextran, dextran derivative, pullulan, xanthan, xyloglucan, starch, hyaluronic acid, guar gum, locust bean gum, gellan, carboxy-methyl-cellulose, acacia gum, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol, or combinations thereof.
12. The solid assembly of claim 1, wherein the carrier is liquid or semi-solid.
13. The solid assembly of claim 1, wherein the carrier has a water activity (Aw) of about 0.95 or less.
14. The solid assembly of claim 1, wherein the carrier is aseptic.
15. The solid assembly of claim 1, wherein the one or more thixotropic suspensions have a shelf life of at least 14 days under refrigerated conditions of about 40° F.
16. The solid assembly of claim 1, wherein the one or more thixotropic suspensions have a shelf life of at least 300 days under refrigerated conditions of about 40° F.
17. The solid assembly of claim 1, wherein the one or more APIs are uniformly dispersed but undissolved within the carrier.
18. The solid assembly of claim 1, wherein the one or more coatings are solid or semi-solid.
19. A method of treating a medical condition, the method comprising: administering a therapeutically effective amount of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to a subject in need thereof, whereby the medical condition is treated; wherein the API is configured in a solid assembly for oral consumption comprising: a solid substrate comprising a surface with one or more depressions; one or more thixotropic suspensions deposited within the depressions of the solid substrate, wherein each thixotropic suspension comprises a homogenous dispersion of one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and a carrier; one or more coatings applied over one or more surfaces of the solid substrate; wherein each API is variably dosed based on a formula that is determined for each specific subject.
20. A method of preparing a solid assembly for oral consumption, the method comprising: depositing one or more thixotropic suspensions onto one or more depressions positioned on a surface of a solid substrate, wherein each thixotropic suspension comprises a homogenous dispersion of one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and a carrier; and applying one or more coatings to one or more surfaces of the solid substrate, wherein each API is variably dosed based on a formula that is determined for a specific subject.
