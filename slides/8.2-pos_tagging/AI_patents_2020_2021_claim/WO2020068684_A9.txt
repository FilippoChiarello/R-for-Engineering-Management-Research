<title>
HYBRID ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK FOR PREDICTION OF OUTCOMES IN CLINICAL TRIALS
</title>

<abstract>
A facility for predicting patient outcomes on the basis of clinical trials is described. The facility obtains information describing one or more completed clinical trials, and extracts features from the obtained clinical trial information. The facility uses the extracted features to train both a time-series data model for predicting clinical outcomes and a non-time-series data model for predicting clinical outcomes. The facility applies these trained models to information describing a subject patient to predict a clinical outcome for the subject patient.

<claims>
1. A method in a computing system, comprising: obtaining information describing one or more completed clinical trials;
extracting features from the obtained clinical trial information; using the extracted features to train both a time-series data model for predicting clinical outcomes and a non-time-series data model for predicting clinical outcomes; and
applying the trained models to information describing a subject patient to predict a clinical outcome for the subject patient.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein predicting a clinical outcome for the subject patient comprises merging clinical outcome predictions produced by applying the trained models.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the time-series data model comprises a recurrent neural network.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein the time-series data model comprises a long short term memory.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the time-series data model comprises a hierarchical neural attention encoder.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein the non-time-series data model comprises a forest of gradient-boosted trees.
7. The method of claim 1 , further comprising causing the predicted clinical outcome to be displayed.
8. One or more memories collectively storing a compound patient survival prediction statistical model data structure, the data structure comprising:
a first submodel trained to predict patient survival using survival observations obtained from one or more cancer treatment clinical trials, the first submodel being a cyclic neural network, the first submodel utilizing time-series data among the survival observations; and
a second submodel trained to predict patient survival using survival observations obtained from one or more cancer treatment clinical trials, the second submodel being a forest of gradient-boosted trees, the second submodel utilizing non-time-series data among the survival observations,
such that the models represented in the data structure can be applied to information about a patient to predict survival of the patient.
9. The one or more memories of claim 8 wherein the first submodel is a recurrent neural network.
10. The one or more memories of claim 8 wherein the first submodel is a long short term memory.
11. The one or more memories of claim 8 wherein the first submodel is a hierarchical neural attention encoder.
12. One or more memories collectively having contents configured to cause a computing system to perform a method, the method comprising:
obtaining information describing one or more completed clinical trials;
extracting features from the obtained clinical trial information; using the extracted features to train both a time-series data model for predicting clinical outcomes and a non-time-series data model for predicting clinical outcomes; and
applying the trained models to information describing a subject patient to predict a clinical outcome for the subject patient.
13. The one or more memories of claim 12 wherein predicting a clinical outcome for the subject patient comprises merging clinical outcome predictions produced by applying the trained models.
14. The one or more memories of claim 12 wherein the timeseries data model comprises a recurrent neural network.
15. The one or more memories of claim 12 wherein the timeseries data model comprises a long short term memory.
16. The one or more memories of claim 12 wherein the timeseries data model comprises a hierarchical neural attention encoder.
17. The one or more memories of claim 12 wherein the nontime-series data model comprises a forest of gradient-boosted trees.
18. The one or more memories of claim 12, the method further comprising causing the predicted clinical outcome to be displayed.
