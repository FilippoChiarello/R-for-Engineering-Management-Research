INFORMATION PROCESSING APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
An information processing apparatus acquires, in regard to a subject in a three-dimensional space, unit element information including information regarding a position, in the space, of each of plural unit elements configuring the subject, draws a space image indicative of a state of a virtual space in which the plural unit elements are arranged using the unit element information, and specifies a posture of the subject in the three-dimensional space on the basis of a result obtained by executing a posture estimation process targeting a two-dimensional image for the drawn space image.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An information processing apparatus, comprising: a unit element information acquisition unit configured to acquire, in regard to a subject in a three-dimensional space, unit element information including information regarding a position, in the space, of each of plural unit elements configuring the subject; a space image drawing unit configured to draw a space image indicative of a state of a virtual space in which the plural unit elements are arranged, using the unit element information; and a posture specification unit configured to specify a posture of the subject in the three-dimensional space on a basis of a result obtained by executing a posture estimation process targeting a two-dimensional image for the drawn space image.
2. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the space image drawing unit draws the space image in accordance with a drawing condition decided on a basis of the unit element information.
3. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the space image drawing unit draws a space image where the plural unit elements are viewed from a viewpoint position and a gaze direction decided on the basis of the unit element information.
4. The information processing apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the subject includes a person, and the space image drawing unit places the viewpoint position in a direction of a front of the person.
5. The information processing apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the space image drawing unit specifies the direction of the front of the person by specifying a position of a face of the person.
6. The information processing apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the space image drawing unit specifies the direction of the front of the person on a basis of a distribution of the plural unit elements.
7. The information processing apparatus according to claim 6, wherein the space image drawing unit draws plural space images in accordance with plural drawing conditions, using same unit element information, and the posture specification unit specifies the posture of the subject on a basis of the plural space images.
8. The information processing apparatus according to claim 6, wherein, after the posture specification unit specifies the posture of the subject using the space image drawn first, the space image drawing unit re-draws, according to a result of the specification, the space image in accordance with a drawing condition different from the first drawing condition, and the posture specification unit specifies the posture of the subject on a basis of the re-drawn space image.
9. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the drawing condition includes a restriction condition for restricting specific elements to be unit elements to be arranged in the virtual space, and the space image drawing unit draws a space image indicative of a state of a virtual space in which some of the unit elements specified in accordance with the drawing conditions are arranged.
10. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the drawing condition includes a condition relating to a light source to be placed in the virtual space, and the space image drawing unit draws a space image indicative of a state of the virtual space in which the light source is placed in accordance with the drawing condition.
11. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the space image drawing unit decides the drawing condition using a result of detection by a sensor capable of detecting a position of the subject.
12. An information processing method, comprising: acquiring, in regard to a subject in a three-dimensional space, unit element information including information regarding a position, in the space, of each of plural unit elements configuring the subject; drawing a space image indicative of a state of a virtual space in which the plural unit elements are arranged using the unit element information; and specifying a posture of the subject in the three-dimensional space on a basis of a result obtained by executing a posture estimation process targeting a two-dimensional image for the drawn space image.
13. A program for a computer, comprising: by a unit element information acquisition unit, acquiring, in regard to a subject in a three-dimensional space, unit element information including information regarding a position, in the space, of each of plural unit elements configuring the subject; by a space image drawing unit, drawing a space image indicative of a state of a virtual space in which the plural unit elements are arranged using the unit element information; and by a posture specification unit, specifying a posture of the subject in the three-dimensional space on a basis of a result obtained by executing a posture estimation process targeting a two-dimensional image for the drawn space image.
