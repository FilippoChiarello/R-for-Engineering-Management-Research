UNAUTHORIZED COMMUNICATION DETECTION REFERENCE DECIDING METHOD, UNAUTHORIZED COMMUNICATION DETECTION REFERENCE DECIDING SYSTEM, AND NON-TRANSITORY COMPUTER-READABLE RECORDING MEDIUM STORING A PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
A method, system, and medium used in unauthorized communication detection in an onboard network system having electronic control units connected to a network include: identifying, from information relating to an attack message on the onboard network system, a communication pattern indicating features of the attack message; determining whether a candidate reference message matches the communication pattern; and determining a reference message used as a reference in determining whether or not a message sent out onto the network is an attack message, using results of the determining of whether or not the candidate reference message matches the communication pattern identified in the identifying operation.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An unauthorized communication detection reference determining method used in unauthorized communication detection in an onboard network system that is executed by an information processing system including at least one memory, the onboard network system including a network and one or more electronic control units connected to the network, the reference message determining method comprising: identifying, from information relating to an attack message on the onboard network system, a communication pattern indicating features of the attack message; determining whether or not a candidate reference message matches a communication pattern identified in the identifying operation; and determining a reference message used as a reference in determining whether or not a message sent out onto the network is an attack message, using results of the determining of whether or not the candidate reference message matches the communication pattern identified in the identifying operation.
2. The unauthorized communication detection reference determining method according to claim 1, wherein, in the identifying operation, a pattern is identified relating to a reception time of a plurality of messages sent out onto the network, as the communication pattern, and wherein, in the reference-message determining operation, one message selected from the plurality of messages based on results of comparison between a planned reception time based on patterns relating to the reception time of each of the plurality of messages, and an actual reception time, is determined to be the reference message.
3. The unauthorized communication detection reference determining method according to claim 1, wherein, in the identifying operation, a pattern relating to a change in data values included in a plurality of messages sent out onto the network is identified as the communication pattern, and wherein, in the reference-message determining operation, one message selected from the plurality of messages based on data values included in the plurality of messages is determined to be the reference message.
4. The unauthorized communication detection reference determining method according to claim 3, wherein the pattern relating to the change in the data value is a pattern relating to whether or not the data value is included in a plurality of messages representing a data amount of the same type included in the plurality of messages sent out onto the network, a pattern relating to a rate of increase or decrease of a data amount included in the plurality of messages representing the data amount of the same type, or a pattern relating to a difference or ratio between data values included in messages representing the data amount of the same type and data values included in messages representing a data amount of another type.
5. The unauthorized communication detection reference determining method according to claim 1, wherein, further, in the reference-message determining operation, in a case where there is no message determined to not match the communication pattern in the determination results in the determining of whether or not the candidate reference message matches the communication pattern, the reference message is determined following a predetermined rule, without using the determination results of the determining of whether or not the candidate reference message matches the communication pattern.
6. The unauthorized communication detection reference determining method according to claim 1, wherein, further, in the reference-message determining operation, in a case where there are a plurality of messages determined to not match the communication pattern, one message selected from the plurality of messages determined to not match the communication pattern following a predetermined rule is determined to be the reference message.
7. The unauthorized communication detection reference determining method according to claim 5, wherein the predetermined rule is a predetermined rule relating to a transmission time or a reception time, or to a data value, of the message that has been sent out onto the network.
8. The unauthorized communication detection reference determining method according to claim 7, further comprising: calculating a prediction value of data included in a message to be received next, wherein, in the identifying operation, the communication pattern is identified by obtaining a model, obtained by executing statistical processing on information relating to the attack message, as the communication pattern, wherein the calculating is performed using the communication pattern, and wherein, in the reference-message determining operation, whether or not the received message matches the communication pattern is determined based on the results of a comparison between the prediction value and the data value that the received message includes.
9. The unauthorized communication detection reference determining method according to claim 8, wherein, in the identifying operation, an autoregressive (AR) model, autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) model, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), or Bayesian model is obtained as the model.
10. An unauthorized communication detection reference determining system for determining a reference message used to detect unauthorized communication in an onboard network system, the onboard network system including a network and one or more electronic control units connected to the network, the reference message determining system comprising: one or more processors; and one or more memories storing at least one sent of instruction that, when executed by the one or more processors, causes the one or more processors to perform operations including identifying, from information relating to an attack message on the onboard network system, a communication pattern indicating features of a change in data values or a communication timing of the attack message, determining whether or not a candidate reference message matches a communication pattern that has been identified by the identifying operation, and determining a reference message used as a reference in determining whether or not a message sent out onto the network is an attack message, using results of determining whether or not the candidate reference message matches the communication pattern identified in the identifying operation.
11. At least one non-transitory computer-readable recording medium storing a program causing an unauthorized communication detection system to detect unauthorized communication in an onboard network system to carry out a reference message determining method, the unauthorized communication detection system including at least one processor and at least one memory, the onboard network system including a network and one or more electronic control units connected to the network, the program, when executed by the at least one processor, causes the at least one processor to perform operations including identifying, from information relating to an attack message on the onboard network system, a communication pattern indicating features of a change in data values or a communication timing of the attack message, determining whether or not a candidate reference message sent out onto the network matches a communication pattern that has been identified in the identifying operation, and determining a reference message used as a reference in determining whether or not a message sent out onto the network is an attack message, using results of determining whether or not the candidate reference message matches the communication pattern identified in the identifying operation.
