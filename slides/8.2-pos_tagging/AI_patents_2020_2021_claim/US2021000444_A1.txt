SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR SEIZURE LOCALIZATION
</title>

<abstract>
In some aspects, the described systems and methods provide for a method comprising transmitting, with at least one transducer, acoustic signals to a brain of a patient, wherein the at least one transducer is configured to induce excitation of a plurality of acoustic modes. The method further comprises receiving, with the at least one transducer, data acquired from the brain including information related to standing waves, frequency response, impulse/transient response, and/or distribution of acoustic modes. The method further comprises determining, from the acquired data, a location of a seizure site within the brain of the person.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: transmitting, with at least one transducer, acoustic signals to a brain of a patient, wherein the at least one transducer is configured to induce excitation of a plurality of acoustic modes; receiving, with the at least one transducer, data acquired from the brain including information related to standing waves, frequency response, impulse/transient response, and/or distribution of acoustic modes; and determining, from the acquired data, a location of a seizure site within the brain of the person.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the location of the seizure site includes providing the acquired data to a machine learning model trained to predict the location of the seizure site.
3. The method of claim 1, further including transmitting, to an external device with a processor for determining the location of the seizure site, the acquired data.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one transducer includes a first transducer for transmitting the acoustic signals and receiving the acquired data.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one transducer includes a first transducer for transmitting the acoustic signals and a second transducer for receiving the acquired data.
6. A device comprising: at least one transducer that transmits acoustic signals to the brain of a person and receives data acquired from the brain including information related to standing waves, frequency response, impulse/transient response, and/or distribution of acoustic modes, for determining, based on the acquired data, a location of a seizure site.
7. The device as claimed in claim 6, wherein the device is wearable by the person.
8. The device as claimed in claim 6, wherein the device is implantable within the skull of the person.
9. The device as claimed in claim 6, wherein the device is portable.
10. The device as claimed in claim 6, wherein the at least one transducer includes a first transducer for transmitting the acoustic signals and receiving the acquired data.
11. The device as claimed in claim 6, wherein the at least one transducer includes a first transducer for transmitting the acoustic signals and a second transducer for receiving the acquired data.
12. At least one non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing processor-executable instructions that, when executed by at least one computer hardware processor, cause the at least one computer hardware processor to perform the acts of: transmitting, with at least one transducer, acoustic signals to a brain of a patient, wherein the at least one transducer is configured to induce excitation of a plurality of acoustic modes; receiving, with the at least one transducer, data acquired from the brain including information related to standing waves, frequency response, impulse/transient response, and/or distribution of acoustic modes; and determining, from the acquired data, a location of a seizure site within the brain of the person.
13. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein determining the location of the seizure site includes providing the acquired data to a machine learning model trained to predict the location of the seizure site.
14. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein the at least one transducer includes a first transducer for transmitting the acoustic signals and receiving the acquired data.
15. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein the at least one transducer includes a first transducer for transmitting the acoustic signals and a second transducer for receiving the acquired data.
