MODEL FOR HEALTH RECORD CLASSIFICATION
</title>

<abstract>
An electronic medical record (EMR) analysis machine automatically clusters electronic medical records to produce an initial EMR analysis model and to identify high-value EMR documents such that human analysts can focus effort on labeling only high-value EMR documents to iteratively and extremely efficiently train an EMR analysis model. High-value sample EMR documents are identified as those whose membership in one or more clusters is most ambiguous, i.e., nearest the cluster boundary.

8. A non-transitory computer readable medium useful in association with a computer which includes one or more processors and a memory, the computer readable medium including computer instructions which are configured to cause the computer, by execution of the computer instructions in the one or more processors from the memory, to build an electronic medical record (EMR) document analysis model by at least: clustering one or more EMR documents to produce one or more clusters to produce cluster membership data for each of the EMR documents; training the EMR document analysis model with membership in the clusters of the EMR documents represented by the membership data as one or more machine learning features of the EMR document analysis model to produce a trained EMR document analysis model; applying the trained EMR document analysis model to the EMR documents to produce adjusted cluster membership data for each of the EMR documents; identifying sample ones of the EMR documents by determining which, of a number of the EMR documents, have adjusted cluster membership data nearest a membership boundary of one or more of the clusters; assigning EMR analysis labels to each of the sample EMR documents; and training the trained EMR document analysis model with the sample EMR documents and the EMR analysis labels assigned to the sample EMR documents to produce an improved EMR document analysis model.
