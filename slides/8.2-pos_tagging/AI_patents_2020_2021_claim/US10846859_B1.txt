<title>
Presentation of machine-readable optical markers
</title>

<abstract>
Machine-readable optical markers may be presented on a surface of a shelf, on a display device, or on a structure. Markers are presented as an array of graphical elements arranged in rows and columns. The graphical elements in the array of the mark utilize color and placement to encode marker data. In addition, a source image graphic may also be blended with a portion of the graphical elements in the array to create a blended image. In other embodiments, the marker may be presented with one or more borders surrounding the perimeter of the graphical elements in the array. The marker data may be presented using infrared light with a visible light layer presented over the array of graphical elements.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: a shelf to stow one or more items; a memory, storing computer-executable instructions; and a hardware processor in communication with the memory, wherein the hardware processor is configured to execute the computer-executable instructions to: present a marker on a surface of the shelf, the marker comprising: an array of graphical elements arranged in a two-dimensional array comprising rows and columns, wherein color and placement of each of the graphical elements in the array is used to separately encode marker data; a source image graphic blended with at least a portion of the graphical elements in the array; and a first border extending around a perimeter of the graphical elements in the array.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the marker is presented on an upper surface, an underside surface, or an outer edge of the shelf.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the marker further comprises a second border extending around a perimeter of the first border.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the marker is presented with a modification in intensity or colors of portions of one or more of the source image graphic, or the graphical elements in the array.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the array of graphical elements is presented underneath the source image graphic.
6. A system comprising: a structure; a memory, storing computer-executable instructions; and a hardware processor in communication with the memory, wherein the hardware processor is configured to execute the computer-executable instructions to: present a marker on the structure, the marker comprising: an array of graphical elements presented using infrared light, wherein the array of graphical elements is arranged in rows and columns, and wherein color and placement in the array of the graphical elements encodes marker data; and a visible light layer presented over the array of graphical elements, wherein the visible light layer is transmissive of at least 50% infrared light and less than 10% visible light.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein: the structure comprises a shelf; and the marker is presented on one or more of a top surface, bottom surface, or outer edge of the shelf.
8. The system of claim 6, further comprising a display device, wherein: the structure comprises a shelf; and the marker is presented on the shelf by the display device.
9. The system of claim 8, the hardware processor further configured to: determine a presentation duration value for the marker; and configure the display device to present the marker on the shelf for a time equivalent to the presentation duration value.
10. The system of claim 6, wherein: the structure comprises a flooring system; and the marker is presented by mounting or embedding the marker into at least a portion of the flooring system.
11. The system of claim 6, wherein: the structure comprises a tote; and the marker is presented on a side of the tote.
12. The system of claim 6, wherein the marker further comprises a source graphic image blended with at least a portion of the graphical elements in the array.
13. The system of claim 6 further comprising markings or visual indicia presented on the visible light layer.
14. The system of claim 6, wherein each of the graphical elements in the array is presented by reflecting or absorbing at least a portion of the infrared light to produce a particular color.
15. A system comprising: a display panel; a communication interface; a memory, storing computer-executable instructions; and a hardware processor in communication with the display panel, the communication interface, and the memory, wherein the hardware processor is configured to execute the computer-executable instructions to: present an image of a marker with the display panel, the image of the marker comprising: an array of graphical elements arranged in rows and columns, wherein a number of columns is greater than a number of rows, and wherein color and placement in the array of the graphical elements encodes marker data; and a source image graphic blended with at least a portion of the graphical elements in the array.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the display panel comprises one or more of an electrophoretic material or a cholesteric material.
17. The system of claim 15, further comprising computer-executable instructions to: access a presentation duration value indicative of a duration to present the image of the marker, wherein the duration is less than 50 milliseconds; and configure the display panel to present the image of the marker for the duration.
18. The system of claim 15, further comprising an inventory location configured to stow one or more items; and wherein the display panel is affixed to the inventory location.
19. The system of claim 15, wherein the image of the marker presented with the display panel further comprises a contiguous border with a first color extending around a perimeter of the array of graphical elements.
20. The system of claim 15, wherein the array of graphical elements is presented underneath the source image graphic.
