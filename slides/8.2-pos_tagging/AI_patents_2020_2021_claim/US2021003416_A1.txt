<title>
Apparatus, Systems And Methods For Automatic Steering Guidance And Visualization Of Guidance Paths
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosed apparatus, systems and methods relate to guidance and visualization systems for autosteering systems of agricultural implements. The system allows the operator to visualize the guidance paths throughout a field map or region to allow for the ability of the operator to make adjustments prior to engaging the auto steering unit, such as to row headings and positions.

<claims>
1. An agricultural vehicle guidance visualization system for use with an automatic steering unit, comprising: a) an operations unit; b) a display running a graphical user interface; and c) a path system in operational communication with the operations unit and display, the path system configured to: i) input one or more field boundaries for a polygonal field map; ii) plot a plurality of guidance paths; iii) display heading, position, and offset for the plurality of plotted guidance paths; and iv) adjust the heading, position, and/or offset of the plurality of plotted guidance paths.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the path system is configured to command the automatic steering unit with the plurality of plotted guidance paths.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the path system is configured to display and adjust the plurality of plotted guidance paths with at least one of an enterprise data adjustment, a squaring adjustment, or an offset adjustment.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the squaring adjustment is configured to: a) determine a guidance path corner radius; and b) display a user prompt querying a square off option.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the path system is configured to display field obstacles.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more field map boundaries are drawn from stored boundary map data.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the path system is configured to populate the stored boundary map data with one or more additional boundary points.
8. A visualization and guidance method for use with an agricultural vehicle automatic steering unit comprising executing a path system configured to: a) plot a plurality of guidance paths in a field map via one or more field map boundaries; b) display the plurality of plotted guidance paths and any skips and overlaps for adjustment of plotted guidance path heading, position, and offset.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the path system is configured to command the automatic steering unit.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the path system is configured to display field map overlaps and skips.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the path system is configured to utilize user defined offsets.
12. A visualization and guidance system for use with automatic steering of an agricultural vehicle, comprising a path system configured to run on an operations unit and in-cab display, wherein the path system is configured to: a) input one or more field boundaries in a polygonal field map on the display; b) plot a plurality of guidance paths in the polygonal field map for display; c) display path heading position and offset for the plurality of guidance paths throughout the plotted field map; and d) adjust the heading, position and offset of the plurality of guidance paths.
13. The visualization and guidance system of claim 12, wherein the path system is configured to command the automatic steering unit.
14. The visualization and guidance system of claim 13, wherein the operations unit is in operational communication with a cloud server.
15. The visualization and guidance system of claim 12, further comprising a squaring adjustment system.
16. The system of claim 12, configured to command a steering unit.
17. The system of claim 12, wherein the system is configured to plot guidance paths through the field region on the basis of a user-defined A-B path.
18. The system of claim 12, wherein the path system is configured to display guidance path headings, positions, skips, and overlaps.
19. The system of claim 12, wherein the path system is configured to apply user defined offsets.
20. The system of claim 12, further comprising an enterprise management system.
