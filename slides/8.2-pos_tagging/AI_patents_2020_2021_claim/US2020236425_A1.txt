METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FILTERING VIDEO
</title>

<abstract>
An artificial intelligence (AI) system for simulating functions such as recognition, determination, and so forth of a human brain by using a mechanical learning algorithm such as deep learning, or the like, and an application thereof are provided. A method of filtering video by a device is provided. The method includes selecting at least one previous frame preceding a current frame being played from among a plurality of frames included in the video, generating metadata regarding the selected at least one previous frame, predicting harmfulness of at least one next frame to be displayed on the device after playback of the current frame, based on the generated metadata, and filtering the next frame based on the predicted harmfulness.

<claims>
1. A method for providing information on a video by a computing device, the method comprising: obtaining, by at least one processor, a video in the computing device; setting a plurality of categories regarding harmfulness of the video; converting the video to a predetermined format for analyzing the video; obtaining a plurality of scores related to whether the converted video has harmful content relating to the plurality of categories; and providing the plurality of scores relating to the plurality of categories.
2. The method of claim 1, the method further comprising: providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for setting the plurality of categories, wherein the plurality of categories are set based on a user input to the GUI.
3. The method of claim 1, the method further comprising: setting a plurality of threshold values to be compared with the plurality of scores related to the plurality of categories; and comparing the plurality of threshold values with the plurality of scores, wherein one or more frames in the video are filtered based on a result of the comparing.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein at least portion of at least one frame is blurred or deleted based on the plurality of scores and the plurality of threshold values.
5. The method of claim 1, the method further comprising: obtaining information indicating an object in the video and a movement of the object, wherein the plurality of scored are determined based on the information indicating an object in the video and a movement of the object.
6. The method of claim 1, the method further comprising: selecting one or more frames in the converted video, wherein the obtaining the plurality of scores comprises obtaining the plurality of scores related to whether the selected one or more frames have harmful content relating to the plurality of categories.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the obtaining of the plurality of scores comprises: by applying at least one artificial intelligence (AI) model trained for determining harmfulness of a video to the converted video, obtaining the plurality of scores output from the at least one AI model.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the at least one AI model is trained with a plurality of videos for determining the harmfulness regarding the plurality of categories.
9. A computing device for providing information on a video, the computing device comprising: a memory; and at least one processor operatively coupled to the memory and configured to: obtain, by at least one processor, a video in the computing device; set a plurality of categories regarding harmfulness of the video; convert the video to a predetermined format for analyzing the video; obtain a plurality of scores related to whether the converted video has harmful content relating to the plurality of categories; and provide the plurality of scores relating to the plurality of categories.
10. The computing device of claim 9, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for setting the plurality of categories, and wherein the plurality of categories are set based on a user input to the GUI.
11. The computing device of claim 9, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to: set a plurality of threshold values to be compared with the plurality of scores related to the plurality of categories; and compare the plurality of threshold values with the plurality of scores, and wherein one or more frames in the video are filtered based on a result of the comparison.
12. The computing device of claim 11, wherein at least portion of at least one frame is blurred or deleted based on the plurality of scores and the plurality of threshold values.
13. The computing device of claim 9, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to obtain information indicating an object in the video and a movement of the object, and wherein the plurality of scored are determined based on the information indicating an object in the video and a movement of the object.
14. The computing device of claim 9, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to select one or more frames in the converted video, and wherein the at least one processor obtains the plurality of scores related to whether the selected one or more frames have harmful content relating to the plurality of categories.
15. The computing device of claim 9, wherein the at least one processor obtains the plurality of scores output from at least one artificial intelligence (AI) model, by applying the at least one AI model trained for determining harmfulness of a video to the converted video.
16. The computing device of claim 15, wherein the at least one AI model is trained with a plurality of videos for determining the harmfulness regarding the plurality of categories.
17. A non-transitory computer computer-readable recording medium having recorded thereon a program, which when executed by at least one processor of a computing device, causes the least one processor to perform a method for providing information on a video, the method comprising: obtaining, by at least one processor, a video in the computing device; setting a plurality of categories regarding harmfulness of the video; converting the video to a predetermined format for analyzing the video; obtaining a plurality of scores related to whether the converted video has harmful content relating to the plurality of categories; and providing the plurality of scores relating to the plurality of categories.
