SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR RECOMMENDING PERSONALIZED CONTENT USING CONTEXTUALIZED KNOWLEDGE BASE
</title>

<abstract>
A system for recommending content for use, by a learner is provided. The system includes a processor in communication with a memory. The memory stores a knowledge base. The processor is configured for identifying a subset of the knowledge base, based on the academic context of the learner and for identifying a first set of content tagged to interlinked nodes of the subset of knowledge base. The processor is configured for identifying a second set of content from the first set of content, based on the behavioral context and the characteristics of the learner. The processor is configured for identifying a learning path for the learner, based on a learning strategy for the learner and a score assigned to a concept. The processor is configured for structuring the identified second set of content for recommending to the learner, based on the identified learning path.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A system for recommending content, to a learner for use by the learner, the system comprising a processor in communication with a memory, the memory storing a knowledge base, an academic context of the learner, a behavioral context of the learner, and a characteristics of the learner, and the processor configured for: identifying a subset of the knowledge base, based on the academic context of the learner; identifying a first set of content tagged to one or more interlinked nodes of the subset of the knowledge base; identifying a second set of content from the first set of content, based on the behavioral context of the learner and the characteristics of the learner; identifying a learning path for the learner, based on a learning strategy for the learner and a score assigned to a concept; structuring the identified second set of content for recommending to the learner, based on the identified learning path; and recommending the structured content to the learner.
2. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the knowledge base is an arranged topology of a plurality of the interlinked nodes, wherein, each node represents a concept.
3. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the structuring the identified second set of content for recommending to the learner is by sorting and prioritizing the content based on one or more parameters associated with each of the contents of the second set of content.
4. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the one or more parameters associated with each of content are determined based on at least one of a score assigned to the concept and a difficulty level of the concept, a measured impact on learning outcomes, a proficiency of the learner in learning the concept, and the behavioral context of the learner.
5. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the academic context of the learner is determined based on at least one of a learning context and a consumption context of the learner.
6. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the behavioral context of the learner is determined based on a behavioral attributes of the learner with reference to a node of the subset of the knowledge base relative to the behavioral attributes of each of a plurality of other learners, with reference to the node.
7. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the characteristics of the learner are determined based on at least one of, an academic ability of the learner, the behavioral attributes of the learner, an effort expended by the learner for learning the concept and the learner's predisposition towards a concept.
8. A method for providing recommendations, the method comprising: providing, by a processor, through a user interface, a structured content to a learner for use by the learner; wherein the processor is coupled to a memory, wherein the memory stores a plurality of modules to be executed by the processor, and wherein the plurality of modules are configured for: identifying a subset of a knowledge base, based on an academic context of the learner; identifying a first set of content tagged to one or more interlinked nodes of the subset of the knowledge base; identifying a second set of content from the first set of content, based on a behavioral context of the learner and a characteristics of the learner; identifying a learning path for the learner, based on a learning strategy for the learner and a score assigned to a concept; structuring the identified second set of content for recommending to the learner, based on the identified learning path; and recommending the structured content to the learner.
9. The method as claimed in claim 8, wherein the knowledge base is an arranged topology of a plurality of interlinked nodes, wherein, each node represents a concept.
10. The method as claimed in claim 8, wherein the structuring the identified second set of content for recommending to the learner is by sorting and prioritizing the content based on one or more parameters associated with each of the contents of the second set of content.
11. The method as claimed in claim 8, wherein the one or more parameters associated with each of content are determined based on at least one of a score assigned to the concept and a difficulty level of the concept, a measured impact on learning outcomes, a proficiency of the learner in learning the concept, and the behavioral context of the learner.
12. The method as claimed in claim 8, comprising recommending content suitable for one or more learning modes based on one or more of a learner's ability, learner's preferences, content hygiene, effectiveness, and content topology.
13. The method as claimed in claim 8, wherein the academic context of the learner is determined based on at least one of a learning context and a consumption context of the learner.
14. The method as claimed in claim 8, wherein the behavioral context of the learner is determined based on a behavioral attributes of the learner with reference to a node of the subset of the knowledge base relative to the behavioral attributes of each of a plurality of other learners, with reference to the node.
15. The method as claimed in claim 8, wherein the characteristics of the learner are determined based on, at least one of an academic ability of the learner, the behavioral attributes of the learner, an effort expended by the learner for learning the concept and the learner's predisposition towards a concept.
