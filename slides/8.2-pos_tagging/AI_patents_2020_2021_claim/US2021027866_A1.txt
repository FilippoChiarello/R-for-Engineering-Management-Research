TRANSPORTATION APPARATUS, INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEM, STORAGE MEDIUM, AND INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A transportation apparatus includes an input interface, an output interface, and a controller. The input interface is capable of detecting a user input in a passenger space. The output interface is capable of outputting information in the passenger space. The controller provides a medical interview question via the output interface. The controller provides an advice message in accordance with an answer to the medical interview question, the answer being received as the user input detected by the input interface.

<claims>
1. A transportation apparatus comprising: an input interface capable of detecting a user input in a passenger space; an output interface capable of outputting information in the passenger space; and a controller configured to provide a medical interview question via the output interface and provide an advice message based on an answer to the medical interview question, the answer being received as the user input detected by the input interface.
2. The transportation apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the controller causes a terminal apparatus to output the advice message.
3. The transportation apparatus according to claim 1, wherein when the controller recognizes information for identifying a user, the controller searches for a medical history of the user and provides the advice message based also on the medical history.
4. The transportation apparatus according to claim 1, wherein when the controller recognizes a destination of a user, the controller estimates travel time to the destination by the transportation apparatus and changes at least one of a content and an amount of the medical interview question in accordance with the travel time.
5. The transportation apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the advice message includes at least any of a proposal for medical consultation, suggestions about daily life, precautions, and a proposal for medication.
6. An information processing system comprising: the transportation apparatus according to claim 1; and a terminal apparatus configured to communicate with the transportation apparatus.
7. The information processing system according to claim 6, wherein the controller causes the terminal apparatus to output the advice message.
8. The information processing system according to claim 6, wherein when the controller recognizes information for identifying a user, the controller searches for a medical history of the user and provides the advice message based also on the medical history.
9. The information processing system according to claim 6, wherein when the controller recognizes a destination of a user, the controller estimates travel time to the destination by the transportation apparatus and changes at least one of a content and an amount of the medical interview question in accordance with the travel time.
10. The information processing system according to claim 6, wherein the advice message includes at least any of a proposal for medical consultation, suggestions about daily life, precautions, and proposal for medication.
11. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing a program which, when executed, causes a controller installed in a transportation apparatus to execute a process, the process comprising: providing a medical interview question via an output interface capable of outputting information in a passenger space; and providing an advice message based on an answer to the medical interview question, the answer being received as a user input detected by an input interface capable of detecting a user input in the passenger space.
12. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 11, wherein the process further comprises: causing a terminal apparatus to output the advice message.
13. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 11, wherein the process further comprises: when information for identifying a user is recognized, searching for a medical history of the user; and providing the advice message based also on the medical history.
14. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 11, wherein the process further comprises: when a destination of a user is recognized, estimating travel time to the destination by the transportation apparatus; and changing at least one of a content and an amount of the medical interview question in accordance with the travel time.
15. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 11, wherein the advice message includes at least any of a proposal for medical consultation, suggestions about daily life, precautions, and a proposal for medication.
16. An information processing method implemented by a controller installed in a transportation apparatus, the information processing method comprising: providing a medical interview question via an output interface capable of outputting information in a passenger space; and providing an advice message based on an answer to the medical interview question, the answer being received as a user input detected by an input interface capable of detecting a user input in the passenger space.
17. The information processing method according to claim 16, further comprising: causing a terminal apparatus to output the advice message.
18. The information processing method according to claim 16, further comprising: when information for identifying a user is recognized, searching for a medical history of the user; and providing the advice message based also on the medical history.
19. The information processing method according to claim 16, further comprising: when a destination of a user is recognized, estimating travel time to the destination by the transportation apparatus; and changing at least one of a content and an amount of the medical interview question in accordance with the travel time.
20. The information processing method according to claim 16, wherein the advice message includes at least any of a proposal for medical consultation, suggestions about daily life, precautions, and a proposal for medication.
