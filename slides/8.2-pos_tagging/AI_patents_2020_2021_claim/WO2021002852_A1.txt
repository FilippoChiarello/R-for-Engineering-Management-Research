INKS INCLUDING RESIN ENCAPSULATED PIGMENT PARTICLES
</title>

<abstract>
An ink includes a dielectric, non-aqueous carrier fluid. The ink also includes pigment particles within the carrier fluid and liquid resin in a dispersed phase encapsulating each of the pigment particles within the carrier fluid. The liquid resin is to be polymerized after the ink is applied to a substrate.

<claims>
1. An ink comprising:
a dielectric, non-aqueous carrier fluid;
pigment particles within the carrier fluid; and
liquid resin in a dispersed phase encapsulating each of the pigment particles within the carrier fluid,
wherein the liquid resin is to be polymerized after the ink is applied to a substrate.
2. The ink of claim 1 , wherein the resin is insoluble in the carrier fluid.
3. The ink of claim 1 , wherein the resin comprises a thermosetting polymer.
4. The ink of claim 1 , wherein the resin comprises at least one of
polyethylene glycol diacrylate and hydroxyethyl methacrylate.
5. A device comprising:
a supply to supply a non-transfer media along a travel path and to which a ground element is to be electrically connected;
a first portion along the travel path to apply droplets of resin encapsulated pigment particles within a dielectric, non-aqueous carrier fluid onto the non transfer media to form at least a portion of an image on the media; and
a second portion downstream from the first portion and including a charge generation portion to emit airborne charges to charge the resin encapsulated pigment particles to move, via attraction relative to the grounded media, through the carrier fluid toward the media to become electrostatically fixed relative to the media.
6. The device of claim 5, wherein the resin encapsulated pigment particles are encapsulated with a liquid resin in a dispersed phase. 7. The device of claim 5, wherein the resin encapsulated pigment particles are encapsulated with a solid resin.
8. The device of claim 5, wherein the resin comprises a thermosetting polymer or a thermoplastic polymer.
9. The device of claim 5, further comprising:
a third portion downstream from the second portion to polymerize the resin via UV radiation or heat.
10. The device of claim 5, wherein the first portion is to receive a drop-ondemand fluid ejection device to eject the droplets of resin encapsulated pigment particles within the dielectric, non-aqueous carrier fluid.
1 1. The device of claim 5, further comprising at least one of:
a first liquid removal portion downstream along the travel path from the second portion to mechanically remove at least a portion of the carrier fluid from the media; and
a second liquid removal portion downstream from the first liquid removal portion and including:
a heated air element to direct heated air onto at least one of the carrier fluid and the media; or
a radiation device to direct at least one of IR radiation and UV radiation onto at least one of the carrier fluid and the media.
12. A method comprising:
selectively depositing, via a fluid ejection device, droplets of resin encapsulated pigment particles within a dielectric, non-aqueous carrier fluid onto an electrically grounded non-absorbing, non-transfer media moving along a travel path to form at least a portion of an image; and directing charges onto the resin encapsulated pigment particles within the deposited carrier fluid on the media to induce movement of the charged resin encapsulated pigment particles, via attraction relative to the grounded media, through the deposited carrier fluid to electrostatically fix the charged resin encapsulated pigment particles in contact relative to the media.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising:
removing the carrier fluid; and
polymerizing the resin to bind the pigment particles to the media.
14. The method of claim 12, further comprising:
encapsulating the pigment particles with a liquid resin in a dispersed phase.
15. The method of claim 12, further comprising:
encapsulating the pigment particles with a solid resin.
