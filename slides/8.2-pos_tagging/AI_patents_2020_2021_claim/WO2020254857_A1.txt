FAST AND ROBUST FRICTION RIDGE IMPRESSION MINUTIAE EXTRACTION USING FEED-FORWARD CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a system and method for rapid noise-robust friction ridge impression minutiae extraction from digital signal using fully convolutional feed-forward neural network. The proposed neural network based system outperforms classical approaches and other neural network based systems for minutiae extraction in both speed and accuracy. The minutiae extracted using the system can be used at least for tasks such as biometric identity verification, identification or dactyloscopic analysis.
