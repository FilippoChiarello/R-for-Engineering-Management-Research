<title>
Road modeling from overhead imagery
</title>

<abstract>
Apparatus and methods are described for roadway lane line detection. An aerial image including a plurality of pixels is received and provides to a classification model. The classification model provides probability values assigned to at least a portion of the plurality of pixels. A comparison of the probability values is performed to select at least one pixel according to the comparison. A lane line object is identified for the selected at least one pixel.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for roadway lane line detection, the method comprising: receiving an aerial image including a plurality of pixels; providing, by a processor, at least a portion of the aerial image to a classification model; receiving, from the classification model, probability values assigned to at least a portion of the plurality of pixels; performing, by the processor, a comparison of the probability values assigned to at least the portion of the plurality of pixels; selecting, by the processor, at least one pixel according to the comparison; determining, by the processor, a lane line for the selected at least one pixel; updating a geographic database according to the determined lane line; and identifying a geographic location for the selected at least one pixel, wherein the geographic database is updated at the identified geographic location.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein a geographic database image stored in the geographic database is updated according to the determined lane line, and the geographic database image has a first spatial resolution greater than a second spatial resolution for the aerial image.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein probe data collected at a mobile device is compared to the lane line for localization of the mobile device.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein an assisted driving feature is provided based on the lane line.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the selected at least one pixel includes multiple pixels overlaid on road boundaries.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: identifying at least one outlier pixel from the plurality of pixels based on a roadway width.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: calculating a lane line groups from the plurality of pixels based on relative distances of the plurality of pixels.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising: calculating a coverage proportion for at least one of the lane line groups; comparing the coverage proportion to a coverage threshold; and determining a type of lane marking based on the comparison with the coverage threshold.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the type of lane marking is a solid line or a dash line.
10. An apparatus for roadway lane line detection, the apparatus comprising: a memory configured to store an aerial image including a plurality of pixels; a processor configured to analyze at least a portion of the aerial image and calculate probability values assigned to at least a portion of the plurality of pixels, wherein a lane line is defined according to the probability values assigned to at least the portion of the plurality of pixels; and a geographic database updated according to the lane line, wherein a geographic location for the portion of the plurality of pixels is identified, and the geographic database is updated at the identified geographic location.
11. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein a geographic database image stored in the geographic database is updated according to the lane line, and the geographic database image has a first spatial resolution greater than a second spatial resolution for the aerial image.
12. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein probe data collected at a mobile device is compared to the lane line for localization of the mobile device.
13. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein an assisted driving feature is provided based on the lane line.
14. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the portion of the plurality of pixels includes multiple pixels overlaid on road boundaries.
15. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the classification device is configured to identify at least one outlier pixel from the plurality of pixels based on a roadway width.
16. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the classification device is configured to calculate a lane line group from the plurality of pixels based on relative distances of the plurality of pixels, and the classification device is configured to calculate a coverage proportion for at least one of the lane line groups, compare the coverage proportion to a coverage threshold, and determine a type of lane marking based on the comparison with the coverage threshold.
17. A non-transitory computer readable medium including instructions that, when executed by a processor, are configured to perform: receiving an aerial image including a plurality of pixels; providing at least a portion of the aerial image to a classification model; receiving, from the classification model, probability values assigned to at least a portion of the plurality of pixels; performing a comparison of the probability values assigned to at least the portion of the plurality of pixels; selecting at least one pixel according to the comparison; determining a lane line for the selected at least one pixel; updating a geographic database according to the determined lane line; and identifying a geographic location for the selected at least one pixel, wherein the geographic database is updated at the identified geographic location.
