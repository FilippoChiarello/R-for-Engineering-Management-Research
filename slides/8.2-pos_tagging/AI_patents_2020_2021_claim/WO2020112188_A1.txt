COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE FOR ARTIFICIAL IMAGE GENERATION
</title>

<abstract>
A computer architecture for artificial image generation is disclosed. According to some aspects, a computing machine receives a voxel model of a target object. The target object is to be recognized using an image recognizer. The computing machine generates, based on the voxel model, a set of TSB (target shadow background-mask) images of the target object. The computing machine receives, at an auto-encoder, a set of real images of the target object. The computing machine generates, using an auto-encoder and based on the set of real images, one or more artificial images of the target object based on the set of TSB images. The computing machine provides, as output, the generated one or more artificial images of the target object.

processing circuitry and memory; the processing circuitry to:
receive a voxel model of a target object, wherein the target object is to be recognized using an image recognizer;
