<title>
ON-DEMAND PROBING FOR QUALITY OF EXPERIENCE METRICS
</title>

<abstract>
In general, the disclosure describes techniques for evaluating application quality of experience metrics over a software-defined wide area network. For instance, a network device may receive an application data packet of a data flow for an application. In response to receiving the application data packet, the network device may assign the data flow to a first link of a plurality of links and initiate a probing process for the data flow on the first link to determine one or more quality of experience (QoE) metrics for the first link. The network device may, at a later time, detect that the data flow is no longer being received. In response to detecting that the data flow is no longer being received, the network device may cease the probing process for the data flow on the first link.
