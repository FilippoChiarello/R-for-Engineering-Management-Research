NETWORK ANOMALY DETECTION APPARATUS, NETWORK ANOMALY DETECTION SYSTEM, AND NETWORK ANOMALY DETECTION METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A network anomaly detection apparatus configured to detect an anomaly of a network to be monitored based on received flow statistical information, the network anomaly detection apparatus including a processor, a memory, a statistical information collection unit, an anomaly detection unit and scenario information. The statistical information collection unit configured to receive flow statistical information aggregated from header information of packets in the network and collect the flow statistical information in a flow statistical information storage unit. Scenario information including a scenario in which a time-series sequential relation of events concerning a plurality of flows is defined. The anomaly detection unit configured to acquire flow statistical information in a predetermined period from the flow statistical information storage unit and determine whether any anomaly exists in the network based on whether any flow statistical information matching the events in the scenario of the scenario information exists.
