IMAGE BASED INSPECTION OF WELL EQUIPMENT
</title>

<abstract>
One or more images of a tubular being run into a well are captured. The one or more images can be captured by an image sensor. The tubular includes a first tubular section and a second tubular section connected together by a connection. An onsite edge gateway local to the image sensor is configured to perform various operations. Based on the captured one or more images, an elevation of the connection relative to a reference elevation of the well is determined. Based on the determined elevation, an operating condition is determined. It is determined whether the operating condition is included in an automation rule. In response to determining that the automation rule includes the operating condition, a signal is transmitted to drive a controllable device.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method, comprising:
capturing one or more images of a tubular being run into a well, the tubular comprising a first tubular section and a second tubular section connected together by a connection;
based on the captured one or more images, determining an elevation of the connection relative to a reference elevation of the well;
based on the determined elevation, generating an operating condition;
determining whether an automation rule includes the operating condition; and in response to determining that the automation rule includes the operating condition, transmitting a signal to drive a controllable device.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the operating condition comprises an alignment position of the connection relative to a blowout preventer of the well.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the automation rule comprises a condition in which the connection is aligned with the blowout preventer. 4. The method of claim 3, wherein the controllable device comprises a control panel in a remote location, and driving the controllable device comprises displaying a representation of the operating condition on the control panel.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the controllable device comprises an alarm, and driving the controllable device comprises triggering the alarm.
6. The method of claim 3, wherein the controllable device comprises a running tool that is running the tubular into the well, and driving the controllable device comprises adjusting a rate at which the running tool is running the tubular into the well.
7. The method of claim 3, wherein the controllable device comprises the blowout preventer, and driving the controllable device comprises closing the blowout preventer.
8. The method of claim 1, comprising determining a rate at which the tubular is being run into the well based on at least two captured images.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the elevation of the connection comprises distinguishing the connection from the first and second tubular sections.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein:
the first tubular section comprises a first drill pipe;
the second tubular section comprises a second drill pipe;
the connection comprises a tool joint; and
distinguishing the connection from the first and second tubular sections comprises identifying the tool joint based on detecting an outer diameter of the tool joint. 11. A system, comprising:
an image sensor configured to capture an image stream of a tubular being run into a well, the tubular comprising a first tubular section and a second tubular section connected together by a connection; and
an onsite edge gateway local to the image sensor and communicatively coupled to the image sensor, the onsite edge gateway configured to perform operations comprising:
receiving an image stream from the image sensor;
determining, from the image stream, an elevation of the connection relative to a reference elevation of the well;
generating, based on the determined elevation, an operating condition; determining whether an automation rule includes the operating condition; and
in response to determining that the automation rule includes the operating condition, transmitting a signal to drive a controllable device in a remote location.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the image sensor is mounted in a fixed position.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the image sensor is portable.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the onsite edge gateway comprises one or more processors and a computer-readable storage medium coupled to the one or more processors and storing programming instructions for execution by the one or more processors, and the programming instructions instruct the one or more processors to perform the operations.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the generating the operating condition comprises determining an alignment position of the connection relative to a blowout preventer of the well.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the automation rule comprises a condition in which the connection is aligned with the blowout preventer. 17. The system of claim 16, comprising the controllable device, wherein:
the contrallable device comprises a control panel; and
driving the controllable device comprises displaying a representation of the operating condition on the control panel. 18. The system of claim 16, comprising the controllable device, wherein:
the controllable device comprises an alarm; and
driving the controllable device comprises triggering the alarm.
19. The system of claim 16, comprising the controllable device, wherein:
the controllable device comprises a running tool configured to run the tubular into the well; and
driving the controllable device comprises adjusting a rate at which the running tool is running the tubular into the well. 20. The system of claim 16, comprising the controllable device, wherein:
the controllable device comprises the blowout preventer; and
driving the controllable device comprises closing the blowout preventer.
21. The system of claim 14, wherein the onsite edge gateway is configured to determine a rate at which the tubular is being run into the well based on at least two captured images received from the image sensor. 22. The system of claim 14, wherein the onsite edge gateway is configured to distinguish the connection from the first and second tubular sections.
