INFORMATION PROCESSING DEVICE, INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
It is desirable to provide a technology for enabling to make a reply to a received message by simple operation.There is provided an information processing device including an output control unit that, in a case where a received message has been obtained through a communication unit, controls display of first and second candidates of a transmission message, and sets the first candidate as a candidate in a selected state, in which: in a case where first pressing force has been detected by a first pressure sensor, the output control unit switches the candidate in the selected state from the first candidate to the second candidate; and in a case where second pressing force has been detected by a second pressure sensor, the output control unit controls the communication unit in such a manner that the candidate in the selected state is transmitted as the transmission message.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An information processing device comprising
an output control unit that, in a case where a received message has been obtained through a communication unit, controls display of first and second candidates of a transmission message, and sets the first candidate as a candidate in a selected state,
wherein: in a case where first pressing force has been detected by a first pressure sensor, the output control unit switches the candidate in the selected state from the first candidate to the second candidate; and in a case where second pressing force has been detected by a second pressure sensor, the output control unit controls the communication unit in such a manner that the candidate in the selected state is transmitted as the transmission message.
2. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein
in a case where third pressing force has been detected by the second pressure sensor, the output control unit controls display of the first and second candidates.
3. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein: in a case where a prediction message based on past input data input by a user has been obtained, the output control unit sets the prediction message as the candidate in the selected state; and in a case where fourth pressing force has been detected by the second pressure sensor, the output control unit controls the communication unit in such a manner that the candidate in the selected state is transmitted as the transmission message.
4. The information processing device according to claim 3, wherein
the input data includes a voice recognition result based on voice data input by the user in the past, or text data input by the user in the past.
5. The information processing device according to claim 3, wherein
in a case where the prediction message has been obtained, the output control unit controls display of the prediction message.
6. The information processing device according to claim 3, wherein
in a case where the prediction message has been obtained, the output control unit does not control display of the prediction message.
7. The information processing device according to claim 3, wherein
on a basis of setting information set by the user, the output control unit changes whether or not to control display of the prediction message.
8. The information processing device according to claim 7, wherein
in a case where the prediction message has been transmitted after having been displayed, the output control unit causes the prediction message to be stored in a first transmission history, and in a case where the prediction message has been transmitted without having been displayed, the output control unit causes the prediction message to be stored in a second transmission history separately from the first transmission history, the second transmission history being browsable.
9. The information processing device according to claim 3, wherein
in a case where the prediction message has been obtained, the output control unit does not control display of the first and second candidates.
10. An information processing method including the steps of: in a case where a received message has been obtained through a communication unit, controlling display of first and second candidates of a transmission message, and setting the first candidate as a candidate in a selected state; in a case where first pressing force has been detected by a first pressure sensor, switching the candidate in the selected state from the first candidate to the second candidate; and in a case where second pressing force has been detected by a second pressure sensor, controlling the communication unit in such a manner that the candidate in the selected state is transmitted as the transmission message.
11. A program causing a computer to function as an information processing device comprising
an output control unit that, in a case where a received message has been obtained through a communication unit, controls display of first and second candidates of a transmission message, and sets the first candidate as a candidate in a selected state,
wherein: in a case where first pressing force has been detected by a first pressure sensor, the output control unit switches the candidate in the selected state from the first candidate to the second candidate; and in a case where second pressing force has been detected by a second pressure sensor, the output control unit controls the communication unit in such a manner that the candidate in the selected state is transmitted as the transmission message.
