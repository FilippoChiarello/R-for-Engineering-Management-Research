IMAGE PROCESSING APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR USE IN AN AUTOFOCUS SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to an image processing apparatus (1) for determining a focused output image(O<sub>AF</sub>(x<sub>i</sub>)) in an autofocus system (13), in particular a passive autofocus system (13). The image processing apparatus (1) may be part of an observation device and be, for example, a microscope (2a) or an endoscope. In order to provide a more reliable autofocus function, the apparatus and the method according to the invention are configured to retrieve a set (11) of input images (I(x<sub>i</sub>)); to compute at least one baseline estimate (f(x<sub>i</sub>)) for at least one input image of the set of input images, the at least one baseline estimate representing image structures having a length scale larger than a predetermined image feature length scale (fl<sub>j</sub>); to compute a set (31) of output images (O(x<sub>i</sub>)); to compute each output image of the set of output images based on one of (a) a different input image of the set of input images and the at least one baseline estimate for this input image and in (b) the at least one baseline estimate for a respective different input image; and to determine one output image of the set of output images as the focused output image. Identifying a baseline by computing the baseline estimate, where the baseline represents image features of only a certain length scale, removes blur and thus allows to more easily identify the output image to autofocus on.
