IN-SITU MONITORING SYSTEM ASSISTED MATERIAL AND PARAMETER DEVELOPMENT FOR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING
</title>

<abstract>
System and methods are provided comprising receiving, via a communication interface of a parameter development module comprising a processor, a defined geometry for one or more parts, wherein the parts are manufactured with an additive manufacturing machine, and wherein a stack is formed from one or more parts; fabricating the one or more parts with the additive manufacturing machine based on a first parameter set; collecting in-situ monitoring data from one or more in-situ monitoring systems of the additive manufacturing machine for one or more parts; determining whether each stack should receive an additional part based on an analysis of the collected in-situ monitoring data; and fabricating each additional part based on the determination the stack should receive the additional part. Numerous other aspects are provided.

<claims>
1. A method comprising:
receiving, via a communication interface of a parameter development module (104) comprising a processor (108), a defined geometry (101) for one or more parts (304), wherein the parts are manufactured with an additive manufacturing machine (114), and wherein a stack (306) is formed from one or more parts;
fabricating the one or more parts with the additive manufacturing machine based on a first parameter set (124);
collecting in-situ monitoring data (504) from one or more in-situ monitoring systems (120) of the additive manufacturing machine for one or more parts;
determining whether each stack should receive an additional part based on an analysis of the collected in-situ monitoring data; and
fabricating each additional part based on the determination the stack should receive the additional part.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein each part includes one or more layers (303).
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the determination whether each stack should receive the additional part is based on at least one of the collected in-situ monitoring data and a predictive material model (118).
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the collected in-situ monitoring data (504) includes at least one of laser-material and laser-environment interactions.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the collected in-situ monitoring data includes a melt-pool response.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein it is determined whether each stack should receive the additional part when the collected in-situ monitoring data falls one of inside or outside of a predetermined value or range of values.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the first parameter set (124) is based on the at least one predictive material model (118).
8. The method of claim 7, wherein fabrication of the predictive material model further comprises:
executing at least one of a bead-on-powder and bead-on-plate process with an initial parameter set (112) to output one or more melt-pool tracks;
collecting in-situ monitoring data from the one or more melt-pool tracks;
executing an in-situ analysis of the one or more melt-pool tracks with one or more insitu monitoring systems (120) of the additive manufacturing machine based on the collected in-situ monitoring data; and
generating at least one predictive material model (118) based on at least one of the insitu monitoring data analysis and one or more tests or measurements performed on the one or more melt-pool tracks.
9. A system comprising:
a parameter development module (104);
a parameter development processor (108); and
a memory (110) storing program instructions, the parameter development processor and the parameter development module operative with the program instructions to perform the functions as follows:
receive, via a communication interface of the parameter development module (104), a defined geometry (101) for one or more parts (304), wherein the parts are
manufactured with an additive manufacturing machine (114), and wherein a stack (306) is formed from one or more parts;
fabricate the one or more parts with the additive manufacturing machine based on a first parameter set (124);
collect in-situ monitoring data (504) from one or more in-situ monitoring systems (120) of the additive manufacturing machine for one or more parts;
determine whether each stack should receive an additional part based on an analysis of the collected in-situ monitoring data; and
fabricate each additional part based on the determination the stack should receive the additional part.
10. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by a computer processor, cause the computer processor to perform a method comprising:
receiving, via a communication interface of a parameter development module (104) comprising a processor (108), a defined geometry (101) for one or more parts (304), wherein the parts are manufactured with an additive manufacturing machine (114), and wherein a stack (306) is formed from one or more parts;
fabricating the one or more parts with the additive manufacturing machine based on a first parameter set (124);
collecting in-situ monitoring data (504) from one or more in-situ monitoring systems (120) of the additive manufacturing machine for at least one of: one or more layers or one or more parts;
determining whether each stack should receive an additional part based on an analysis of the collected in-situ monitoring data; and
fabricating each additional part based on the determination the stack should receive the additional part.
