MEDICAL SCAN TRIAGING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A medical scan triaging system is operable to generate a global abnormality probability for each of a plurality of medical scans by utilizing a computer vision model trained on a training set of medical scans. A triage probability threshold is determined based on user input to a client device. A first subset of the plurality of medical scans, designated for human review, is determined by identifying medical scans with a corresponding global abnormality probability that compares favorably to the triage probability threshold. A second subset of the plurality of medical scans, designated as normal, is determined by identifying ones of the plurality of medical scans with a corresponding global abnormality probability that compares unfavorably to the triage probability threshold. Transmission of the first subset of the plurality of medical scans to a plurality of client devices associated with a plurality of users is facilitated.
