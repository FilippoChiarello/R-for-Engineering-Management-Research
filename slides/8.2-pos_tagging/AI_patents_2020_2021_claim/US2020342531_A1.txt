CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING SELECTION SYSTEM AND METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method of optimizing cryptographic mining yields includes analyzing, by a cryptocurrency mining selection system, data associated with factors of interest for one or more cryptocurrencies using machine learning algorithms. Data that is determined to be predictive of the future value of newly mined tokens is used to determine which tokens will have the highest and lowest future values. Based on the predicted value of tokens in the future and the current value of those tokens for each cryptocurrency, the system outputs one or more instructions to buy tokens in cryptocurrencies predicted to increase in value, to sell tokens in cryptocurrencies predicted to decrease in value, and to instruct associated cryptocurrency mining hardware to switch to generating new tokens in one or more selected cryptocurrencies to maximize yields.

<claims>
1. A cryptocurrency mining selection system, comprising: a memory configured to receive and store data associated with a plurality of factors of interest for each of a plurality of cryptocurrencies; and a processor configured to determine, for each of the factors, data associated with mining a new token for each of the cryptocurrencies, generate, for each of the cryptocurrencies and from the data associated with mining an associated token, a value associated with mining a new token for each of the cryptocurrencies, and output, to a second computing system, indicia associated with at least the highest value token.
2. The system of claim 1 wherein the value includes a prediction of a future value of each token.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the operation of determining the data associated with mining the token is performed by the processor using one or more machine learning algorithms.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the second computing system includes cryptocurrency mining hardware.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the directive is an instruction to the cryptocurrency mining hardware to switch from mining tokens associated with a second cryptocurrency to mining tokens associated with the highest value token.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the outputted indicia includes an instruction to trade one of the plurality of tokens associated with one of the cryptocurrencies.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the second computing system is associated with a trading portfolio that includes assets associated with one or more cryptocurrencies.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein at least one of the plurality of sources is a distributed ledger technology associated with one of the plurality of cryptocurrencies.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the data for the associated cryptocurrency includes one or more of a current market value of the token, a cost to generate the token, a current rate of generation of the token, or the number of active wallet addresses for the associated distributed ledger technology.
10. A method, comprising: receiving, by a cryptocurrency mining selection system, from a plurality of sources, data associated with a plurality of factors of interest for each of a plurality of cryptocurrencies determining, by the cryptocurrency mining selection system, for each of the factors, data associated with mining a new token for each of the cryptocurrencies; generating, by the cryptocurrency mining selection system, for each of the cryptocurrencies and from the data associated with mining of an associated token, a value associated with mining each token for each of the cryptocurrencies; and outputting, by the cryptocurrency mining selection system and to a second computing system, indicia associated with at least the highest value token.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the value includes a prediction of a future value of each token.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein the operation of determining the data associated with mining of the token is performed by the cryptocurrency mining selection system using one or more machine learning algorithms.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the second computing system includes cryptocurrency mining hardware.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the directive is an instruction to the cryptocurrency mining hardware to switch from mining tokens associated with a second cryptocurrency to mining tokens associated with the highest value token.
15. The method of claim 10, wherein the outputted indicia includes an instruction to trade one of the plurality of tokens associated with one of the cryptocurrencies.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the second computing system is associated with a trading portfolio that includes assets associated with one or more cryptocurrencies.
17. The method of claim 10, wherein at least one of the plurality of sources is a distributed ledger technology associated with one of the plurality of cryptocurrencies.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the data for the associated cryptocurrency includes one or more of a current market value of the token, a cost to generate the token, a current rate of generation of the token, or the number of active wallet addresses for the associated distributed ledger technology.
19. A method, comprising: analyzing, using one or more machine learning algorithms, data associated with a plurality of factors of interest for one or more cryptocurrencies; selecting, based on the analysis operation, data predictive of a future value of a newly generated token for each cryptocurrency; determining, based on the selected data, a future value of tokens associated with each cryptocurrency; and performing an operation associated with one or more of the cryptocurrencies, the operation selected from the group consisting of outputting an instruction to purchase an asset associated with a token predicted to increase in value in the future, outputting an instruction to sell an asset associated with a token predicted to decrease in value in the future, and outputting an instruction to cryptocurrency mining hardware to generate tokens for one or more cryptocurrencies based at least in part on the determined future value of the tokens.
20. The method of claim 19, further comprising: receiving, from one or more distributed ledger technologies each associated with a cryptocurrency, at least some of the data associated with the factors of interest, and wherein the data includes one or more of a current market value of the token, a cost to generate the token, a current rate of generation of the token, or the number of active wallet addresses for the associated distributed ledger technology.
