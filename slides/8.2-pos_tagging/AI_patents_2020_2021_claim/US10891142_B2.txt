Method and device for preloading application, storage medium, and terminal device
</title>

<abstract>
A method for preloading an application, a storage medium, and a terminal device are provided. The method includes the following. In response to a target application being detected to be closed, current state feature information of a terminal device is acquired. The current state feature information is compared with historical state feature information of the terminal device when the target application was closed. Target historical state feature information closest to the current state feature information is determined from within the historical state feature information according to a comparison result. The target application is preloaded, in response to determining that the target application is about to be launched again according to a historical usage regularity corresponding to the target historical state feature information.
