Dialogue system, a dialogue method, a method of generating data for training a dialogue system, a system for generating data for training a dialogue system and a method of training a dialogue system
</title>

<abstract>
A dialogue system comprising: an input for receiving input data relating to a speech or text signal originating from a user; an output for outputting speech or text information specified by a dialogue act; and a processor configured to: generate features from the input signal; for each of a plurality of classifier models, each classifier model corresponding to a dialogue slot, and for one or more values corresponding to the dialogue slot, input features generated from the input signal, the classifier model outputting a probability corresponding to each of three or more relations, wherein the relations specify the relation of the value to the dialogue slot; update a belief state based on the outputs of the classifier models; determine a system dialogue act by inputting information relating to the belief state into a policy model; output speech or text information specified by the determined dialogue act at the output.
