<title>
Resource provisioning and replacement according to a resource failure analysis in disaggregated data centers
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments for preemptive deep diagnostics of resources in a disaggregated computing environment. A set of new resources of a first type is provided to an available resource pool within the disaggregated computing environment. An estimate for an expected time to failure (ETTF) for each one of the set of new resources is computed, and respective ones of the new resources from the available resource pool are provisioned to respective workloads based on the ETTF.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for preemptive deep diagnostics of resources in a disaggregated computing environment, by a processor, comprising: providing a set of new resources of a first type to an available resource pool within the disaggregated computing environment; computing an estimate for an expected time to failure (ETTF) for each resource of the set of new resources, wherein the ETTF of each resource of the set of new resources is computed by testing the each resource of the set of new resources prior to providing the set of new resources to the available resource pool, and wherein an ETTF tag is attached to each resource of the set of new resources subsequent to the testing; and provisioning respective resources of the new resources from the available resource pool to respective workloads based on the ETTF, wherein the respective resources of the set of new resources are assigned to the respective workloads according to the ETTF tag and a workload priority comprising a service level agreement (SLA); and wherein the provisioning further includes: provisioning, to the respective workloads having a higher level SLA, respective resources of the set of new resources having a higher ETTF than those respective resources of the set of new resources having a lower ETTF; and provisioning, to the respective workloads comprising opportunistic workloads, respective resources of the set of new resources having an imminent failure indication within the ETTF tag.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the ETTF of the each resource of the set of new resources is based on a resource type and a failure pattern analysis of historically monitored data of the resource type.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the testing comprises health check diagnostic testing performed on one of a dedicated diagnostic server and a server executing one of the respective workloads.
4. A system for preemptive deep diagnostics of resources in a disaggregated computing environment, comprising: a processor executing instructions stored in a memory device; wherein the processor: allocates a set of new resources of a first type to an available resource pool within the disaggregated computing environment; computes an estimate for an expected time to failure (ETTF) for each resource of the set of new resources, wherein the ETTF of each resource of the set of new resources is computed by testing the each resource of the set of new resources prior to providing the set of new resources to the available resource pool, and wherein an ETTF tag is attached to each resource of the set of new resources subsequent to the testing; and provisions respective resources of the new resources from the available resource pool to respective workloads based on the ETTF, wherein the respective resources of the set of new resources are assigned to the respective workloads according to the ETTF tag and a workload priority comprising a service level agreement (SLA); and wherein the provisioning further includes: provisioning, to the respective workloads having a higher level SLA, respective resources of the set of new resources having a higher ETTF than those respective resources of the set of new resources having a lower ETTF; and provisioning, to the respective workloads comprising opportunistic workloads, respective resources of the set of new resources having an imminent failure indication within the ETTF tag.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the ETTF of the each resource of the set of new resources is based on a resource type and a failure pattern analysis of historically monitored data of the resource type.
6. The system of claim 4, wherein the testing comprises health check diagnostic testing performed on one of a dedicated diagnostic server and a server executing one of the respective workloads.
7. A computer program product for preemptive deep diagnostics of resources in a disaggregated computing environment, by a processor, the computer program product embodied on a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having computer -readable program code portions stored therein, the computer-readable program code portions comprising: an executable portion that allocates a set of new resources of a first type to an available resource pool within the disaggregated computing environment; an executable portion that computes an estimate for an expected time to failure (ETTF) for each resource of the set of new resources, wherein the ETTF of each resource of the set of new resources is computed by testing the each resource of the set of new resources prior to providing the set of new resources to the available resource pool, and wherein an ETTF tag is attached to each resource of the set of new resources subsequent to the testing; and an executable portion that provisions respective resources of the new resources from the available resource pool to respective workloads based on the ETTF, wherein the respective resources of the set of new resources are assigned to the respective workloads according to the ETTF tag and a workload priority comprising a service level agreement (SLA); and wherein the provisioning further includes: provisioning, to the respective workloads having a higher level SLA, respective resources of the set of new resources having a higher ETTF than those respective resources of the set of new resources having a lower ETTF; and provisioning, to the respective workloads comprising opportunistic workloads, respective resources of the set of new resources having an imminent failure indication within the ETTF tag.
8. The computer program product of claim 7, wherein the ETTF of the each resource of the set of new resources is based on a resource type and a failure pattern analysis of historically monitored data of the resource type.
9. The computer program product of claim 7, wherein the testing comprises health check diagnostic testing performed on one of a dedicated diagnostic server and a server executing one of the respective workloads.
