<title>
A PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT MODEL FOR PREDICTING WIND TURBINE OIL FILTER WEAR LEVEL
</title>

<abstract>
A method for predicting a wind turbine oil filter wear level wherein a differential pressure exists between upstream and downstream sides of the filter. The method includes extracting features from wind turbine sensor data to provide extracted data and selecting features from the extracted data that correlate with a change in the differential pressure. The method also includes estimating a filter condition by learning a filter regressive linear model that uses filter direct environment operating conditions data obtained from the extracted data. In addition, the method includes forecasting at least one operating condition scenario represented by three features obtained from the extracted data. Further, the method includes forecasting a filter wear level wherein the filter model uses the at least one forecasted operating condition scenario represented by the three features.
