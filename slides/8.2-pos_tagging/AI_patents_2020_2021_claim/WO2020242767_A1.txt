<title>
USING METAMODELING FOR FAST AND ACCURATE HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION OF MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING MODELS
</title>

<abstract>
Herein are techniques that train regressor(s) to predict how effective would a machine learning model (MLM) be if rained with new hyperparameters and/or dataset. In an embodiment, for each training dataset, a computer derives, from the dataset, values for dataset metafeatures. The computer performs, for each hyperparameters configuration (HC) of a MLM, including landmark HCs: configuring the MLM based on the HC, training the MLM based on the dataset, and obtaining an empirical quality score that indicates how effective was said training the MLM when configured with the HC. A performance tuple is generated that contains: the HC, the values for the dataset metafeatures, the empirical quality score and, for each landmark configuration, the empirical quality score of the landmark configuration and/or the landmark configuration itself. Based on the performance tuples, a regressor is trained to predict an estimated quality score based on a given dataset and a given HC.
