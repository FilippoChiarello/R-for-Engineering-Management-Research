<title>
Methods and systems for an automated design, fulfillment, deployment and operation platform for lighting installations
</title>

<abstract>
A platform for design of a lighting installation generally includes an automated search engine for retrieving and storing a plurality of lighting objects in a lighting object library and a lighting design environment providing a visual representation of a lighting space containing lighting space objects and lighting objects. The visual representation is based on properties of the lighting space objects and lighting objects obtained from the lighting object library. A plurality of aesthetic filters is configured to permit a designer in a design environment to adjust parameters of the plurality of lighting objects handled in the design environment to provide a desired collective lighting effect using the plurality of lighting objects.

<claims>
1. 1-20. (canceled)
21. A method of near-field illumination pattern matching, comprising: capturing a plurality of two dimensional images of an illumination effect in an environment illuminated by a light source; storing a portion of the plurality of images in a digital data structure that facilitates distinguishing among the stored data values in each image of the plurality of images by a two-dimensional location in an image of the plurality of images and an effective distance of the image from the light source; detecting a specified pattern of illumination of the environment in the digital data structure, wherein the pattern includes a plurality of data values identified by a two-dimensional location value and light source distance value.
22. The method of claim 21, wherein at least two of the data values from the plurality of data values in the specified pattern are located at different light source distance values.
23. The method of claim 21 wherein the light source distance value varies across a portion of the specified pattern of illumination.
24. The method of claim 21, wherein the plurality of two-dimensional images is non-co-planar.
25. The method of claim 24, wherein the images in the plurality of two-dimensional images are substantially parallel.
26. The method of claim 21, wherein the images in the plurality of two-dimensional images are substantially parallel.
27. The method of claim 21, wherein the illumination effect is an impact of illumination by the light source on at least one object in the environment.
28. The method of claim 21, wherein the two-dimensional images include data representing an impact of light from the light source on at least one object in the environment.
29. The method of claim 21, wherein the detecting includes extracting a plurality of data values from the digital data structure based on the two-dimensional location value and the light source distance value for each of the extracted data values.
30. The method of claim 21, wherein the light source distance value includes an image identifier.
31. The method of claim 30, wherein the image identifier is configured to facilitate identifying an image of the plurality of images.
32. 32-427. (canceled)
