RECOGNITION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A recognition system of a chip in a game parlor having a game table includes a game recording device which records a state of the chips stacked on the game table as an image using a camera and a chip determination device which analyzes an image of the state of the recorded chips to determine the number and the type of the chips bet by a player. The chip determination device has a function of storing a characteristic of an image of a predetermined state of the chip, and of outputting and displaying, as a determination result, a fact of an unclear determination when the image obtained from the game recording device at the time of determining is the image of the predetermined state.

<claims>
1. A recognition system of a chip in a game parlor where a game table is provided, comprising: a game recording device which records a state of chips stacked on the game table as an image using a camera; and a chip determination device which analyzes the image of the recorded state of the chips to determine a number and a type of the chips bet by a player, wherein the chip determination device further has a function of storing a characteristic of an image of a predetermined state of the chip and of outputting and displaying the fact of an unclear determination as a determination result when it is determined that the image obtained from the game recording device is the image of the predetermined state at the time of determining.
2. The recognition system of the chip according to claim 1, wherein: the chip determination device includes an artificial intelligence device, the artificial intelligence device learns a plurality of images used in a past determination in a case where there is an error in determination in the chip determination device as training data, and the chip determination device further has a function of self-determining a determination accuracy on the basis of an image where there is an error in a determination result as a result of the learning, and of outputting and displaying the fact of an unclear determination that there is a doubt in determination as the determination result.
3. The recognition system of the chip according to claim 2, wherein the chip determination device further has a function of analyzing an image of the game recording device in a case where the self-determination is unclear, determining whether a cause of the unclear determination is a state where the chips stacked on the game table overlap each other or a state where a part of or an entire single chip is hidden by other chips, and stores the cause.
4. The recognition system of the chip according to claim 1, wherein the game recording device assigns an index or a time to an image acquired from the camera, or assigns a tag which specifies a stacking state of the chips such that the record of the game can be analyzed subsequently by the chip determination device.
5. The recognition system of the chip according to claim 1, wherein the chip determination device includes a second artificial intelligence device, and the second artificial intelligence device learns a plurality of images used in a past determination in a case where the chip determination device makes a correct determination and information of the chip as training data.
6. The recognition system of the chip according to claim 1, wherein the chip determination device analyzes an image recorded by a camera different from the camera in a case where a self-determination is unclear to determine the number and the type of the chips bet by the player.
7. The recognition system of the chip according to claim 1, wherein the chip determination device determines that it is the image of the predetermined state in a case where a next chip is recognized while a certain number of chips or more in a vertical direction are not recognized, and outputs and displays the fact of the unclear determination as a determination result.
8. The recognition system of the chip according to claim 1, wherein the chip determination device compares a number of chips determined from a height of the chips and a number determined by analyzing an image of a state of the chips, and in a case where the numbers are different, the chip determination device determines that it is the image of the predetermined state, and outputs and displays the fact of an unclear determination as a determination result.
9. A recognition system which has a plurality of types of determination targets, determines a target for each type to determine a number of the targets for each type, comprising: a recording device which records a state of the state as an image using a camera; and a determination device including an artificial intelligence device which analyzes the image of the recorded target to determine the number of the types of the targets, wherein the determination device has learnt a past determination result as training data and has a function of self-determining an accuracy in determination, and a function of self-determining that there is a doubt in a determination result in a case the accuracy is equal to or less than a certain level and of outputting and displaying the fact of an unclear determination as the determination result.
