Method And System For Determining A Non-Job Related Score From Reported Historical Job Performance
</title>

<abstract>
A method of determining a Trac score representing an individual's future employment behavior using past and present employment behavior that are unrelated to skills and job match within a job and across multiple jobs of an individual when combined with public and available external records. A method employing a Trac score calculation system comprises at least one processor to execute computer program instructions for obtaining one or more ratings from one or more users through one or more user devices connected to the Trac score calculation system that assigns the credibility to the ratings. A combination of the Trac sub-score obtained by accumulating the ratings weighted by estimated credibility of each rating, and Adjustment sub-score obtained by processing available external records in public and private forms, creates a Trac score which is a numerical and reflects an aggregation of available data weighted by what is believed to affect the employment behavior.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method of determining a Trac score representing an individual's future employment behavior using past and present employment behavior that are unrelated to skills and job match within a job and across plurality of jobs of said individual when combined with public and available external records, the method employing a Trac score calculation system comprising at least one processor configured to execute computer program instructions for performing the method comprising: obtaining one or more ratings from one or more users through one or more user devices connected to the Trac score calculation system; assigning credibility to the obtained ratings by invoking an external credibility process engine, wherein the credibility of the rating is estimated based on source of the rating, degree of consistency of the rating with one or more available ratings different from the ratings, recency of the rating, and estimated credibility of the one or more users entering the rating; inserting one or more external factor ratings from an external factors list to the obtained ratings by processing available external records, both public and private forms by invoking an exterior external factors engine; obtaining a Trac sub-score by accumulating the obtained ratings weighted by estimated credibility of each of the one or more ratings; computing a Trac score by combining a Trac sub-score and an adjustment sub-score obtained by performing merging actions on the obtained one or more ratings, wherein the Trac score is a numerical that reflects an aggregation of the available external records comprising public and private forms weighted by factors that affect the employment behavior.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising displaying additional information accompanied by one or more red flags, wherein the additional information is provided to an employer for consideration before hiring the individual for the job, and wherein the Trac score comprises the combination of the Trac sub-score and the adjustment sub-score along with the additional information accompanied by the one or more red flags.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the Trac score is used to create a pricing policy that determines whether the individual has the employment behavior needed for performing a future job.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the Trac score of the individual is combined with a job match score of the individual for a particular job, to determine whether the individual has the future employment behavior, the skills, and the fitness for performing the particular job.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the obtained one or more ratings comprises a Trac score questions list, a flag questions list, and an external factors list.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the external credibility process engine inserts the obtained one or more ratings comprising the credibility into one or more ratings list and updates the credibility for each the one or more ratings.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the exterior external factors engine updates, inserts, deletes or replaces the one or more obtained ratings for the same external factor into the one or more ratings list.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein obtaining the Trac sub-score by accumulating the obtained ratings weighted by estimated credibility of each of the one or more ratings further comprises: performing merging actions on the obtained one or more ratings with the credibility and returning a list of unique merged ratings by a merging module of the Trac score calculation system; and combining the merged one or more ratings into a final trac score and computing a Trac score by a Trac score computation module of the Trac score calculation system from the merged ratings.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein computing the Trac score by the Trac score computation module of the Trac score calculation system further comprises: combining the unique merged one or more ratings of type Trac into a Trac sub-score; combining the unique merged one or more ratings of type flag and external into an adjustment sub-score; and combining the Trac sub-score and the adjustment sub-score into the final Trac score thereby calculating the Trac score by the Trac score calculation system.
10. A Trac score calculation system for determining a Trac score representing an individual's future employment behavior using past and present employment behavior that are unrelated to skills and job match within a job and across plurality of jobs of the individual when combined with public and available external records, the system comprising: a non-transitory computer readable storage medium configured to store computer program instructions defined by modules of the Trac score calculation system; and at least one processor communicatively coupled to the non-transitory computer readable storage media, the at least one processor configured to execute the computer program instructions defined by modules of the Trac score calculation system, the modules comprising: a receiving module for obtaining one or more ratings from one or more users through one or more user devices connected to the Trac score calculation system; a credibility module for assigning credibility to the obtained ratings by invoking an external credibility process engine, wherein the credibility of the rating is estimated based on source of the rating, degree of consistency of the rating with one or more available ratings different from the ratings, recency of the rating, and estimated credibility of the one or more users entering the rating; an insertion module for inserting one or more external factor ratings from an external factors list to the obtained ratings by processing available external records, both public and private forms by invoking an external factors engine; a \Trac sub-score module for obtaining Trac sub-score by accumulating the obtained ratings weighted by estimated credibility of each of the one or more ratings; a Trac score computation module for computing the Trac score by combining a Trac sub-score and an adjustment sub-score obtained by performing merging actions on the obtained one or more ratings, wherein the Trac score is a numerical that reflects an aggregation of the available external records comprising public and private forms weighted by factors that affect the employment behavior.
11. The system of claim 10, further comprising displaying additional information accompanied by one or more red flags, wherein the additional information is provided to an employer for consideration before hiring the individual for the job, and wherein the Trac score comprises the combination of the Trac sub-score and the adjustment sub-score along with the additional information accompanied by the one or more red flags.
12. The system of claim 10, wherein the Trac score is used for pricing a policy of the individual.
13. The system of claim 10, wherein the obtained one or more ratings comprises a Trac score questions list, a flag questions list, and an external factors list.
14. The system of claim 10, wherein the external credibility process engine inserts the obtained one or more ratings comprising the credibility into one or more ratings list and updates the credibility for each the one or more ratings.
