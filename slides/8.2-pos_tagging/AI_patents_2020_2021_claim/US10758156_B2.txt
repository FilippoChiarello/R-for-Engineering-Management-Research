<title>
Monitor of oral respiration
</title>

<abstract>
An improved device for monitoring respiration or other vital signs of a user using one or more sensors. The invention may be worn within the mouth of the user to allow more accurate, direct, and fast measurements. The invention may also include a distribution mechanism that may be used to administer a substance such as medication. The substance may be administered in response to data collected by one or more of the sensors in the device and/or in response to data received from another device.

<claims>
1. A system for monitoring respiration of a user, comprising: an intraoral device having an air pressure sensor and a temperature sensor; a memory having a machine-readable medium comprising machine executable code; and one or more processors coupled to the memory, said one or more processors configured to execute the machine executable code, wherein the machine executable code is capable of causing the one or more processors to: receive a set of data comprising data output from the air pressure sensor and data output from the temperature sensor; process the received data to identify a respiratory attribute of the user based on whether the received data indicates a change in pressure that exceeds a first predetermined percentage change or a change in temperature that exceeds a second predetermined percentage change; and generate an output indicating the attribute, wherein the machine executable code is capable of causing the one or more processors to process the received data using a machine learning algorithm.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the respiratory attribute identifies whether the user is inhaling or exhaling.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the machine learning algorithm is a neural network.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the temperature sensor is a thermopile having a field of view directed at a surface of the user's mouth.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the temperature sensor is a thermopile having a field of view directed at a surface of the user's mouth.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the respiratory attribute comprises the user's respiratory rate.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the respiratory attribute comprises a change in the user's respiratory rate.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the respiratory attribute comprises a waveform depicting the user's respiratory rate.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the pressure sensor is at least partially covered by a water-resistant, breathable membrane.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the membrane comprises Tyvek.
11. The system of claim 9, wherein the membrane comprises Gore-Tex.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the intraoral device is a retainer.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the intraoral device is a mouthpiece.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the intraoral device is a tooth implant.
15. The system of claim 11, wherein the intraoral device is cemented to a molar of the user.
16. The system of claim 1, wherein the temperature sensor is a thermopile.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein the thermopile has a field of view directed at a surface of the user's air pathway.
18. A system for monitoring respiration of a user, comprising: an intraoral device having a pressure sensor and a temperature sensor; a memory having a machine-readable medium comprising machine executable code; and one or more processors coupled to the memory, said one or more processors configured to execute the machine executable code, wherein the machine executable code is capable of causing the one or more processors to: receive data comprising data output from the pressure sensor and data output from the temperature sensor; determine whether the received data indicates a change in pressure that exceeds a first predetermined percentage change; determine whether the received data indicates a change in temperature that exceeds a second predetermined percentage change; and generate an output indicating whether the user is exhaling or inhaling based on the change in pressure exceeding a first predetermined percentage change or the change in temperature exceeding a second predetermined percentage change.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein the pressure sensor is at least partially covered by a water-resistant, breathable membrane.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein the membrane comprises Tyvek.
21. The system of claim 19, wherein the membrane comprises Gore-Tex.
