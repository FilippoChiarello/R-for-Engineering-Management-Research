OPTIMIZING A DIGITAL DISPLAY
</title>

<abstract>
An approach is provided for optimizing a digital display. Classifications of advertisements are determined. A location of a future action in an event is predicted. A sentiment of an audience is determined. The audience includes spectators at the venue, viewers who are viewing the event via devices receiving a live broadcast of the event, or a combination of the spectators and the viewers. Based on the location of the future action, a digital display is selected from digital displays in the venue and content on the digital display is predicted to be captured as an image by a camera and broadcast to devices of the viewers. Based on the classifications, the sentiment, the location of the future action, and the content being predicted to be captured and broadcast, an advertisement is selected. The selected advertisement is sent to the selected digital display.
