VEHICLE CONTROL APPARATUS, VEHICLE CONTROL METHOD, AND STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle control apparatus includes: a recognizer which is configured to recognize a motion of the face of a user present outside a vehicle; a determiner which is configured to determine a stop position of the vehicle on the basis of the motion of the face recognized by the recognizer; and a driving controller which controls at least the speed of the vehicle such that the vehicle is caused to stop at the stop position determined by the determiner.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A vehicle control apparatus comprising: a recognizer configured to recognize a motion of the face of a user present outside a vehicle; a determiner configured to determine a stop position of the vehicle on the basis of the motion of the face recognized by the recognizer; and a driving controller configured to control at least a speed of the vehicle such that the vehicle is caused to stop at the stop position determined by the determiner.
2. The vehicle control apparatus according to claim 1, wherein seats arranged in at least two rows in a traveling direction and a cargo compartment are provided in the vehicle, and wherein the recognizer is configured to recognize a line of sight of the user as the motion of the face, and the determiner is configured to determine, as the stop position, any of a first position at which the user is closest to a seat in a first row, a second position at which the user is closest to a seat in a second row, and a third position at which the user is closest to the cargo compartment on the basis of the line of sight recognized by the recognizer.
3. The vehicle control apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the determiner is configured to change the stop position when the recognizer has recognized a first gesture after the vehicle has moved to the stop position, and is configured to redetermine the stop position when the recognizer has recognized a second gesture different from the first gesture after the vehicle has moved to the stop position.
4. The vehicle control apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the first gesture is an action that the user takes when the user agrees to the stop position and the second gesture is an action that the user takes when the user does not agree to the stop position.
5. The vehicle control apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the determiner is configured to redetermine the stop position on the basis of the line of sight recognized by the recognizer when the recognizer has recognized the second gesture.
6. The vehicle control apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the driving controller is configured to cause the vehicle to move to the redetermined stop position when the stop position is redetermined by the determiner.
7. A vehicle control method, using an in-vehicle computer, comprising: recognizing a motion of the face of a user present outside a vehicle; determining a stop position of the vehicle on the basis of the recognized motion of the face; and controlling at least a speed of the vehicle such that the vehicle is caused to stop at the stop position.
8. A computer-readable non-transitory storage medium storing a program for causing an in-vehicle computer to execute: recognition of a motion of the face of a user present outside a vehicle; determination of a stop position of the vehicle on the basis of the recognized motion of the face; and control of at least a speed of the vehicle such that the vehicle is caused to stop at the stop position.
