ULTRASOUND MARKER, ULTRASOUND MARKER SYSTEM AND METHOD OF OPERATING AN ULTRASOUND MARKER SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
The invention refers to an ultrasound marker that comprises an enclosure. The marker comprises an energy transducer for transducing impeding sound energy into electric energy. The marker also comprises an ultrasound emitter that is configured to generate an ultrasound signal when fed with electric energy. The marker further comprises a trigger that is operatively connected to the ultrasound emitter and that can be activated via a wireless signal. The trigger is configured to control the generation of ultrasound by the ultrasound emitter in dependence of the wireless signal.
