MOBILE TERMINAL
</title>

<abstract>
A mobile terminal includes a memory; a sensor configured to detect state information of the mobile terminal; and a controller configured to: collect the state information of the mobile terminal and an authentication item used for user authentication when an authentication situation is detected; learn at least one authentication item corresponding to the state information among a plurality of authentication items; and cause the memory to store a result of the learning.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A mobile terminal comprising: a communication unit configured to communicate with an external terminal; at least one sensor configured to detect a current state of the mobile terminal; a plurality of authentication modules configured to obtain information used for authenticating a user of the mobile terminal; and a controller configured to: for each of a plurality of authentication instances using the obtained information, transmit to the external terminal via the communication unit learning data comprising an authentication module of the plurality of authentication modules used for obtaining the information for authenticating the user and a state of the mobile terminal detected via the at least one sensor during the authentication instance; receive, from the external terminal, learned associations between different states of the mobile terminal and the corresponding authentication module used for each of the different states, wherein the learned associations are determined from the transmitted learning data; and activate one or more of the plurality of authentication modules to authenticate the user for a current authentication instance based on a current state of the mobile terminal according to the received learned associations.
2. The mobile terminal of claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to activate all of the plurality of authentication modules when the current state of the mobile terminal is not included in the learned associations.
3. The mobile terminal of claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to transmit to the external terminal via the communication unit the authentication module used for the current authentication instance and a state of the mobile terminal detected during the current authentication instance for updating the learning data.
4. The mobile terminal of claim 1, wherein the at least one sensor comprises at least a gyroscopic sensor, an accelerometer sensor, a proximity sensor, or an illumination sensor, and wherein the state information comprises at least a sensed value of the gyroscopic sensor, a sensed value of the accelerometer sensor, a sensed value of the proximity sensor, or a sensed value of the illumination sensor.
5. The mobile terminal of claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to initiate an authentication instance in response to: the gyroscopic sensor or the accelerometer sensor senses a movement value within a specific value range; a display of the mobile terminal is turned on; or an application requiring authentication is executed at the mobile terminal.
6. The mobile terminal of claim 1, wherein the obtained information used for authenticating a user of the mobile terminal comprises at least two from the list of facial information of a user; vein information of a user; iris information of a user; fingerprint information of a user; or voice information of a user.
7. The mobile terminal of claim 6, further comprising at least two from the list of a camera; an infrared camera; a fingerprint sensor; or a microphone.
8. An authentication method of a mobile terminal, the method comprising: for each of a plurality of authentication instances, transmitting to an external terminal learning data comprising an authentication module of a plurality of authentication modules of the mobile terminal used for obtaining information for authenticating a user and a state of the mobile terminal detected via at least one sensor of the mobile terminal during the authentication instance; receiving, from the external terminal, learned associations between different states of the mobile terminal and the corresponding authentication module used for each of the different states, wherein the learned associations are determined from the transmitted learning data; and activating one or more of the plurality of authentication modules to authenticate the user for a current authentication instance based on a current state of the mobile terminal according to the received learned associations.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising activating all of the plurality of authentication modules when the current state of the mobile terminal is not included in the learned associations.
10. The method of claim 8, further comprising transmitting to the external terminal the authentication module used for the current authentication instance and a state of the mobile terminal detected during the current authentication instance for updating the learning data.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein the at least one sensor comprises at least a gyroscopic sensor, an accelerometer sensor, a proximity sensor, or an illumination sensor, and wherein the state information comprises at least a sensed value of the gyroscopic sensor, a sensed value of the accelerometer sensor, a sensed value of the proximity sensor, or a sensed value of the illumination sensor.
12. The method of claim 8, further comprising initiating an authentication instance in response to: the gyroscopic sensor or the accelerometer sensor senses a movement value within a specific value range; a display of the mobile terminal is turned on; or an application requiring authentication is executed at the mobile terminal.
13. The method of claim 8, wherein the obtained information used for authenticating a user of the mobile terminal comprises at least two from the list of facial information of a user; vein information of a user; iris information of a user; fingerprint information of a user; and voice information of a user.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the mobile terminal comprises at least two from the list of a camera; an infrared camera; a fingerprint sensor; or a microphone.
