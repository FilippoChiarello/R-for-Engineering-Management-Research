METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR MANUFACTURING SMALL ADAPTIVE ENGINES
</title>

<abstract>
A method for manufacturing small adaptive engines uses a battlefield repository having cloud services that is configured to enable additive manufacturing (AM) of engine parts and assemblies. The method also uses a compilation of recipes/signatures for building the engine parts and the assemblies using additive manufacturing (AM) processes and machine learning programs An additive manufacturing system and an alloy powder suitable for performing the additive manufacturing (AM) processes can be provided. In addition, the engine parts can be built using the additive manufacturing (AM) system, the alloy powder, the battlefield repository and the compilation of recipes/signatures. A system for manufacturing small adaptive engines includes the battlefield repository, the compilation of recipes/signatures, a foundry system for providing the alloy powder and an additive manufacturing (AM) system configured to perform the additive manufacturing (AM) processes.
