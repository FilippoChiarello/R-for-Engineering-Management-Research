Scoring social media content
</title>

<abstract>
Among other things, a method includes accessing stored social media content, the social media content comprising elements of social media, the social media content associated with data indicating timing information associated with respective elements of social media content, at least some of the timing information expressed as an offset relative to a time associated with a media program associated with the social media content; and for at least one element of social media, determining, for at least some of terms of the element of social media, the frequency of the terms across elements of social media associated with the media program, each term comprising a portion of the element of social media, determining an importance value for at least some of the terms of the element of social media, the importance value indicating the importance of the respective term, based on the frequency of terms determined for the element of social media, and based on the received importance values, determining a frequency value for the element of social media, determining one or more weights for the element of social media, and based on the frequency value and the weights, determining a score for the element of social media.
