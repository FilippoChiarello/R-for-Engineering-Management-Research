<title>
MACHINE LEARNING-BASED GENERATIVE DESIGN FOR PROCESS PLANNING
</title>

<abstract>
For manufacturing design by a machine-learned network (46), a machine-learned model (44) is trained to generate (13) a bill of process (BOP) given information from a bill of materials (BOM). Rather than rely on manual processes and associated problems, the machine-learned model (44) provides a BOP given a new product design that is described in the BOM. The machine-learned model (44) may more likely generate an optimized BOP by using a structured input in the form of a knowledge graph. Other machine-learned models (44) may be used, such as for generating (31) the knowledge graph and/or application for selecting from various possible BOPs.
