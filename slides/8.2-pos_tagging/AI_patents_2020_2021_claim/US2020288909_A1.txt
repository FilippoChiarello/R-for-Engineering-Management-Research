COOKING DEVICE, SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING THE COOKING DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A method for controlling a cooking device includes the following steps: recording an image of food; implementing a recognition of the recorded image of the food to determine the likelihood that the food corresponds to known foods. If a probability value exceeds a default threshold value, a cooking program associated with the known food is selected and specified to the cooking device. The probability value for the recorded image and the associated food is increased in response to a user subsequently starting the selected cooking program, and reduced in response to the user discarding the selected cooking program. A cooking device includes a primary control unit for controlling the cooking functions; a network interface with a second control unit, and a camera for recording images of the cooking space. The second control unit processes recorded images independently of the primary control unit and transmits them over the network interface.

<claims>
1. A method to control a cooking device, comprising the following steps: recording an image of food to be cooked; implementing a recognition of the recorded image of the food to be cooked, based on machine learning, to determine probability values of a likelihood that the food to be cooked corresponds to known foods to be cooked; upon one of the probability values exceeding a default threshold value, selecting a cooking program associated with the corresponding one of the known foods to be cooked; specifying the selected cooking program to the cooking device; and at least one of the two following steps: increasing the probability value for the recorded image and the one of the known foods associated with the recorded image in response to a user subsequently starting the selected cooking program; and reducing the probability value for the recorded image and the one of the known foods associated with the recorded image in response to the user discarding the selected cooking program.
2. The method according to claim 1, when one the two following conditions is met: no probability value exceeds the default threshold value; and the user discards the selected cooking program, the method comprising the following steps: detecting at least one of the food to be cooked and a cooking program subsequently selected by the user of the cooking device; and at least one of the following two steps: creating an association between the recorded image and at least one of the food to be cooked and the cooking program; and increasing of the probability of an existing assignment.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the image is recorded by a camera of the cooking device or by a mobile terminal.
4. The method according to claim 1, when the probability values of a plurality of known foods to be cooked exceed the default probability value, further comprising the following steps selecting a respective cooking program for each of the known foods to be cooked whose probability value exceeds the default threshold value; giving input to the cooking device of the selected respective cooking programs in the sequence of descending probability values; wherein the probability value for the recorded image and the one of the known foods associated with the recorded image is increased for the one of the selected respective cooking programs that is subsequently started by the user.
5. The method according to claim 4, wherein the probability value for the recorded image and the associated food to be cooked is reduced for cooking programs which the user does not subsequently start.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein the selected cooking program is input to the cooking device in that a food to be cooked is specified for the associated cooking program.
7. A cooking device (2) for implementing the method according to claim 1, the cooking device comprising: a primary device control unit (18, 26) for controlling operating elements, display elements (14), and cooking functions of the cooking device; a network interface with a second control unit (16); and a camera (6) connected to the second control unit (16) and configured to record images of a cooking space of the cooking device; wherein the second control unit (16) is configured to process recorded images independently of the primary device control unit (18) and to transmit them over the network interface.
8. The cooking device according to claim 7, wherein the second control unit is a system-on-chip device (40) configured to perform image processing and network functionality.
9. A cooking system, comprising: a cooking device (2) according to claim 7, a server (4) with a database (10) storing image characteristics of known foods to be cooked, wherein, for each of the known foods to be cooked, the database stores a uniquely associated cooking program; and a network interface; wherein the server (4) is programmed to perform the following steps: implementing a recognition of a recorded image of food to be cooked received over the network interface, based on machine learning (12), to determine probability values of a likelihood that the food to be cooked corresponds to known foods to be cooked; upon one of the probability values exceeding a default threshold value, selecting a cooking program associated with the corresponding one of the known foods to be cooked; and specifying the selected cooking program to the cooking device (2).
