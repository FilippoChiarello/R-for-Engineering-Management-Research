Condition monitoring system
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a measurement device for a rotating system, the measurement device providing a first sensor arranged in the vicinity of a shaft of the rotating system, the first sensor being configured to generate a signal relating to a rotation of the shaft, and a control unit connected to the first sensor. The control unit is further configured to form a first parameter based on the signal from the first sensor, determine a current time reference, form a data package having the first parameter and a time stamp relating to the current time reference, and distribute the data package to at least one monitoring device over a network connected to the control unit. The present invention also relates to a monitoring system having the measurement device and a corresponding method for monitoring a condition of a rotating system.
