</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are Code Chain-based models, apparatuses, systems, methods, and applications. When implementing interaction based on Code Chain, each digital person has identity information, the identity information corresponding to a person represented by the digital person and/or the terminal device used by the person; the method comprising: identifying, by the terminal device, a coding medium generated according to a Code Chain access protocol so as to enable the digital person to access a Code Chain network on behalf of the person; and performing data transfer with another digital person and/or system according to entrustment of the person. Through identification of the coding medium, the access address of the code chain server is obtained, and then the address of the server which actually provides services is obtained from the Code Chain server, such that the service is obtained by providing a service parameter as required.
