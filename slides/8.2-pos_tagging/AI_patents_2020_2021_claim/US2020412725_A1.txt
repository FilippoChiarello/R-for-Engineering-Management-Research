<title>
CLOUD-BASED SHARED SECURITY CACHE
</title>

<abstract>
There is disclosed in one example a computing apparatus, including: a processor and a memory; a network interface; and a security agent including instructions encoded within the memory to instruct the processor to: identify an unknown software object; query, via the network interface, a global reputation store for a global reputation for the unknown software object; receive a response from the global reputation store and determine that the unknown software object does not have a reliable global reputation; compute a local reputation for the unknown software object; and share the local reputation for the unknown software object with the global security cache.

<claims>
1. A computing apparatus, comprising: a processor and a memory; a network interface; and a security agent comprising instructions encoded within the memory to instruct the processor to: identify an unknown software object; query, via the network interface, a global reputation store for a global reputation for the unknown software object; receive a response from the global reputation store and determine that the unknown software object does not have a reliable global reputation; compute a local reputation for the unknown software object; and share the local reputation for the unknown software object with the global security cache.
2. The computing apparatus of claim 1, wherein sharing the local reputation for the unknown software object comprises uploading a hash of the unknown software object.
3. The computing apparatus of claim 1, wherein sharing the local reputation for the unknown software object comprises uploading metadata about the unknown software object.
4. The computing apparatus of claim 3, wherein the metadata comprise multi-dimensional metadata.
5. The computing apparatus of claim 1, wherein computing a local reputation for the unknown software object comprises performing local sandbox analysis on the unknown software object.
6. The computing apparatus of claim 1, wherein computing a local reputation for the unknown software object comprises performing local deep static analysis on the unknown software object.
7. The computing apparatus of claim 1, wherein computing a local reputation for the unknown software object comprises performing local behavioral analysis on the unknown software object.
8. The computing apparatus of claim 1, wherein computing a local reputation for the unknown software object comprises performing local heuristic analysis of a user reaction to the unknown software object.
9. The computing apparatus of claim 1, wherein the security agent further comprises instructions to receive from the global reputation store a not-reliable reputation based at least in part on analysis by other endpoints.
10. The computing apparatus of claim 9, wherein the security agent further comprises instructions to assign a weight to the not-reliable reputation.
11. One or more tangible, non-transitory computer-readable storage mediums having stored thereon executable instructions to instruct a processor to: detect on a local host a security object, and determine that the security object does not have a locally-cached security reputation; query a non-local reputation store for a reliable reputation for the security object; receive from the non-local reputation store a response that the security object lacks a reliable reputation; analyze the security object to assign the security object a provisional local reputation; and upload the provisional local reputation to the non-local reputation store.
12. The one or more tangible, non-transitory computer-readable mediums of claim 11, wherein instructions are further to receive from the non-local reputation store a not-reliable reputation based at least in part on analysis by other endpoints.
13. The one or more tangible, non-transitory computer-readable mediums of claim 12, wherein the instructions are further to act on the not-reliable reputation.
14. The one or more tangible, non-transitory computer-readable mediums of claim 12, wherein the instructions are further to assign a weight to the not-reliable reputation.
15. The one or more tangible, non-transitory computer-readable mediums of claim 14, wherein assigning the weight comprises assessing a prevalence of the security object.
16. The one or more tangible, non-transitory computer-readable mediums of claim 14, wherein assigning the weight comprises assessing a type of analysis performed by one or more other endpoints to derive the not-reliable reputation.
17. The one or more tangible, non-transitory computer-readable mediums of claim 14, wherein assigning the weight comprises assessing a time since last encounter for the security object.
18. The one or more tangible, non-transitory computer-readable mediums of claim 14, wherein assigning the weight comprises comparing an operating environment of one or more endpoints that contributed to the not-reliable reputation to an operating environment of a local host.
19. A computer-implemented method of providing globally cached reputations for unknown security objects, comprising: performing a first identification of a security object; determining that the security object is not permitted to operate on a local host without a sufficiently-positive reputation; querying a non-local security repository for a global reputation for the security object; determining that the non-local security repository has not assigned the security object a global reputation; locally analyzing the security object to assign the security object a provisional reputation; and uploading the provisional reputation to the non-local security repository.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein uploading the provisional reputation comprises uploading a hash of the security object.
