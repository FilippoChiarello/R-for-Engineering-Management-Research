<title>
IMAGE SEGMENTATION USING REFERENCE GRAY SCALE VALUES
</title>

<abstract>
The invention provides for a medical imaging system (100, 300, 400) comprising a memory (110) containing machine executable instructions (120) and a processor (106). Execution of the machine executable instructions cause the processor to: receive (200) a magnetic resonance image (300), receive (202) meta data descriptive of the magnetic resonance image, wherein the metadata comprises reference gray scale value data (124) for two or more tissue types; and segment (204) the magnetic resonance image using an image segmentation algorithm (126) that uses the reference gray scale value data.

13. A computer program product comprising machine executable instructions stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium for execution by a processor controlling a medical imaging system, wherein execution of the machine executable instructions cause the processor to: receive a magnetic resonance image; receive meta data descriptive of the magnetic resonance image, wherein the metadata comprises reference gray scale value data as numerical values which are referenced respectively to two or more tissue types; and segment the magnetic resonance image using an image segmentation algorithm that is modified on the basis of the reference gray scale value data.
14. A method of operating a medical imaging system, wherein the method comprises: receiving a magnetic resonance image; receiving meta data descriptive of the magnetic resonance image, wherein the metadata comprises reference gray scale value data as numerical values which are referenced respectively to two or more tissue types; and segmenting the magnetic resonance image using an image segmentation algorithm that is modified on the basis of the reference gray scale value data.
