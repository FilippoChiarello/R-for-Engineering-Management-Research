USING ENVIRONMENT AND USER DATA TO DELIVER ADVERTISEMENTS TARGETED TO USER INTERESTS, E.G. BASED ON A SINGLE COMMAND
</title>

<abstract>
A system and an associated method for responding to a user's voice inquiry are disclosed. The system accepts the voice inquiry and obtains personal data regarding the user. The system then identifies potential subjects of interest in the voice inquiry from media content currently provided to the user through a device which has captured the voice inquiry, media content present in or capturing the user's surroundings, or media content previously provided to the user as responses to previous voice inquiries by the user. Next, the system determines at least one subject of interest based on at least one of the personal data and the user's previous voice inquiries. The system then presents a response related to the determined subject of interest to the user's voice inquiry.

<claims>
1. A method of processing audio information, comprising: receiving a user's voice inquiry from an electronic device; determining at least one interest element related to the voice inquiry from at least one of: media content currently provided to the user by the electronic device, media content from the user's environment, and media content previously provided to the user as responses to previous voice inquiries by the user; and generating a response related to the determined interest element to the user's voice inquiry.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the electronic device is selected from the group consisting of a television, a radio, a gaming console, a laptop, a tablet, a convertible laptop, a cellular phone, a wearable device, and a kiosk, and wherein presenting the response related to the determined interest element includes presenting the response via the electronic device.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the media content includes media content from a movie, a television program, a radio show, a song, a video, a game, and/or an advertisement.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining the media content representing the user's environment based on information related to the user's location.
5. The method of claim 16, wherein the personal data indicates the user's identity and/or preferences.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the media content representing the user's environment captures scenes or sounds present in the environment.
7. An audio processing system, comprising one or more processors configured to: receive a user's voice inquiry from an electronic device; determine at least one interest element related to the voice inquiry from at least one of: media content currently provided to the user by the electronic device, media content from the user's surroundings, and media content previously provided to the user as responses to previous voice inquiries by the user; and generate a response related to the determined interest element to the user's voice inquiry.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein: the at least one electronic device is selected from the group consisting of a television, a radio, a gaming console, a laptop, a tablet, a convertible laptop, a cellular phone, a wearable device, a dashboard, and a kiosk, and the one or more processors is configured to present the response on the device.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein the media content includes media content from a movie, a television program, a radio show, a song, a video, a game, and/or an advertisement.
10. The system of claim 7, wherein the one or more processors is further configured to determine the media content from the user's environment based on information on a current time or a current location of the user.
11. The system of claim 13, wherein the obtained personal data indicates the user's identity, habits, preferences, and/or moods.
12. The system of claim 13, wherein the one or more processors is configured to present the response based on the obtained personal data.
13. The system of claim 7, wherein the one or more processors is further configured to: obtain personal data related to the user; and determine the at least one interest element based, at least in part, on the personal data.
14. The system of claim 7, wherein the one or more processors is further configured to output the response via the electronic device.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein when the at least one interest element is determined from media content currently provided to the user on the electronic device, the one or more processors is configured to: output the response in association with the media content currently provided to the user on the electronic device.
16. The method of claim 1, further comprising: obtaining personal data related to the user; and determining the at least one interest element based, at least in part, on the obtained personal data.
17. The method of claim 1, further comprising outputting the response via the electronic device.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein when the at least one interest element is determined from media content currently provided to the user on the electronic device, the method includes: outputting the response in association with the media content currently provided to the user on the electronic device.
