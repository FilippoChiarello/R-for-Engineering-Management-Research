METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR MANAGING VOICE RESPONSE SYSTEMS TO OPTIMIZE RESPONSES
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments for managing a voice response system by one or more processors are described. A communication is received from an individual. A response to the received communication is determined based on at least one data source associated with the individual. The determined response is caused to be executed by a computing device.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method, by one or more processors, for managing a voice response system comprising: receiving a communication from an individual; determining a response to the received communication based on at least one data source associated with the individual; and causing the determined response to be executed by a computing device.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the determined response includes an auditory response, and the causing of the determined response to be executed by the computing device includes causing the auditory response to be rendered by a speaker.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the determined response includes an action performed by the computing device, and the causing of the determined response to be executed by the computing device causing the action to be performed by the computing device.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the determining of the response to the received communication is performed utilizing a cognitive analysis.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one data source associated with the individual includes at least one of electronic communications, social media activity, and a schedule.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one data source includes data collected by at least one sensor.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving feedback from the individual after the causing of the determined response to be executed by the computing device; receiving a second communication from the individual; and determining a second response to the second communication based on the at least one data source associated with the individual and the received feedback.
8. A system for managing a voice response system comprising: at least one processor that receives a communication from an individual; determines a response to the received communication based on at least one data source associated with the individual; and causes the determined response to be executed by a computing device.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the determined response includes an auditory response, and the causing of the determined response to be executed by the computing device includes causing the auditory response to be rendered by a speaker.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the determined response includes an action performed by the computing device, and the causing of the determined response to be executed by the computing device causing the action to be performed by the computing device.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the determining of the response to the received communication is performed utilizing a cognitive analysis.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the at least one data source associated with the individual includes at least one of electronic communications, social media activity, and a schedule.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the at least one data source includes data collected by at least one sensor.
14. The system of claim 8, wherein the at least one processor further: receives feedback from the individual after the causing of the determined response to be executed by the computing device; receives a second communication from the individual; and determines a second response to the second communication based on the at least one data source associated with the individual and the received feedback.
15. A computer program product for managing a voice response system by one or more processors, the computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable program code portions stored therein, the computer-readable program code portions comprising: an executable portion that receives a communication from an individual; an executable portion that determines a response to the received communication based on at least one data source associated with the individual; and an executable portion that causes the determined response to be executed by a computing device.
16. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the determined response includes an auditory response, and the causing of the determined response to be executed by the computing device includes causing the auditory response to be rendered by a speaker.
17. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the determined response includes an action performed by the computing device, and the causing of the determined response to be executed by the computing device causing the action to be performed by the computing device.
18. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the determining of the response to the received communication is performed utilizing a cognitive analysis.
19. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the at least one data source associated with the individual includes at least one of electronic communications, social media activity, and a schedule.
20. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the at least one data source includes data collected by at least one sensor.
21. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the computer-readable program code portions further include: an executable portion that receives feedback from the individual after the causing of the determined response to be executed by the computing device; an executable portion that receives a second communication from the individual; and an executable portion that determines a second response to the second communication based on the at least one data source associated with the individual and the received feedback.
