DETECTING AND RESPONDING TO ATTEMPTS TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO USER ACCOUNTS IN AN ONLINE SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
In response to detected attempts to gain unauthorized access to user accounts of an online system, a security module of an online system applies an attack response policy to take actions in response to the attempts. Possible responses of the policy include reordering credential types requested by the online system during multi-factor authentication-enabled login, switching to a mode in which login requests are accepted but login is not permitted for the requesting user, and logging information about the login requests. Logged information may be applied to enhance the ability to prevent future unauthorized accesses, such as adding credential values to a list of common credential values and prohibiting users from associating those values with their accounts, or training a model based on the logged information to predict a probability that a given login request is unauthorized.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method performed by an online system, comprising: determining, for an account of a user of the online system, that the user must provide a first credential type before a second credential type in order to obtain access to the account;
receiving from an accessing user a request to login to the account, the request including a value of the first credential type;
based at least in part on the value, determining that the request is likely unauthorized; and
responsive to determining that the request is likely unauthorized:
determining that the accessing user must provide the second credential type before the first credential type in order to obtain access to the account.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising:
determining that requests from a second accessing user to login to an account of a second user of the online system are likely unauthorized; and
responsive to determining that the requests are likely unauthorized:
continuing to accept requests to login from the second accessing user, such that login to the account of the second is denied regardless of whether values of credentials provided in the requests are correct.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising:
determining that requests from a second accessing user to login to an account of a second user of the online system are likely unauthorized; and
responsive to determining that the requests are likely unauthorized:
logging information about the requests to login.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 3, wherein the information comprises one or more of IP addresses of the requests, time of the requests, frequency of the requests, and whether the request was submitted via an API or a graphical user interface, the computer-implemented method further comprising:
training a model by providing the information as feature input to a supervised machine learning algorithm, the model when applied to feature input of login requests indicating whether the login requests are likely
unauthorized.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 3, wherein the information comprises credential values submitted along with the requests, the computer-implemented method further comprising:
identifying, as common credential values, ones of the credential values submitted with at least a threshold frequency;
receiving a request from a user to change a credential value of the user to one of the identified common credential values; and
rejecting the request of the user to change the credential value of the user to the one of the identified common credential values.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 3, further comprising:
identifying users to whose accounts login was requested using one of the
identified common credential values;
determining, based on the identified users, properties defining a user group being attacked; and
implementing a defensive policy measure to accounts of users of the user group.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 6, wherein the defensive policy measure comprises altering, for the accounts, at least one of: a number of failed login requests permitted before account locking, and a time of automatic unlocking after account locking.
8. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that when executed by a computer processor of an online system perform actions comprising:
determining, for an account of a user of the online system, that the user must provide a first credential type before a second credential type in order to obtain access to the account;
receiving from an accessing user a request to login to the account, the request including a value of the first credential type;
based at least in part on the value, determining that the request is likely unauthorized; and
responsive to determining that the request is likely unauthorized:
determining that the accessing user must provide the second credential type before the first credential type in order to obtain access to the account.
9. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 8, further comprising: determining that requests from a second accessing user to login to an account of a second user of the online system are likely unauthorized; and
responsive to determining that the requests are likely unauthorized:
continuing to accept requests to login from the second accessing user, such that login to the account of the second is denied regardless of whether values of credentials provided in the requests are correct.
10. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 8, further comprising:
determining that requests from a second accessing user to login to an account of a second user of the online system are likely unauthorized; and
responsive to determining that the requests are likely unauthorized:
logging information about the requests to login.
11. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 10, wherein the information comprises one or more of IP addresses of the requests, time of the requests, frequency of the requests, and whether the request was submitted via an API or a graphical user interface, the computer-implemented method further comprising:
training a model by providing the information as feature input to a supervised machine learning algorithm, the model when applied to feature input of login requests indicating whether the login requests are likely
unauthorized.
12. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 10, wherein the information comprises credential values submitted along with the requests, the computerimplemented method further comprising:
identifying, as common credential values, ones of the credential values submitted with at least a threshold frequency;
receiving a request from a user to change a credential value of the user to one of the identified common credential values; and
rejecting the request of the user to change the credential value of the user to the one of the identified common credential values.
13. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 10, further comprising:
identifying users to whose accounts login was requested using one of the identified common credential values; determining, based on the identified users, properties defining a user group being attacked; and
implementing a defensive policy measure to accounts of users of the user group.
14. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein the defensive policy measure comprises altering, for the accounts, at least one of: a number of failed login requests permitted before account locking, and a time of automatic unlocking after account locking.
15. An online system comprising:
a computer processor; and
a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that when executed by the computer processor perform actions comprising:
determining, for an account of a user of the online system, that the user must provide a first credential type before a second credential type in order to obtain access to the account;
receiving from an accessing user a request to login to the account, the request including a value of the first credential type;
based at least in part on the value, determining that the request is likely unauthorized; and
responsive to determining that the request is likely unauthorized:
determining that the accessing user must provide the second
credential type before the first credential type in order to obtain access to the account.
16. The online system of claim 15, further comprising:
determining that requests from a second accessing user to login to an account of a second user of the online system are likely unauthorized; and
responsive to determining that the requests are likely unauthorized:
