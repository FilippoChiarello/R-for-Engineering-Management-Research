<claims>
1. An image processing system comprising: a vehicle; and an information processing device, wherein the vehicle includes: an image pickup device; a first image acquiring unit configured to acquire a first image that shows a periphery of the vehicle, the first image picked up by the image pickup device; and a position data sending unit configured to send position data to the information processing device, the position data indicating a position of the vehicle when the first image is picked up, and the information processing device includes: a position data receiving unit configured to receive the position data from the position data sending unit; a second image acquiring unit configured to acquire a plurality of second images for machine learning, the plurality of second images being relevant to the position of the vehicle based on the position data; a grouping unit configured to divide the plurality of second images into a plurality of groups based on a parameter indicating a condition at time of image pickup; an analyzing unit configured to analyze a balance among the plurality of groups, the balance being a balance of the number of the second images that belong to the plurality of groups; an image requesting unit configured to request a third image to the vehicle based on an analysis result by the analyzing unit, the third image being an image that is selected from the first image and by which the balance is adjusted; an image receiving unit that receives the third image from the vehicle; and a learning unit that performs learning based on the second images and the third image, and generates a learning database.
2. An image processing system comprising: a vehicle; and an information processing device, wherein the vehicle includes: an image pickup device; a first image acquiring unit configured to acquire a first image that shows a periphery of the vehicle, the first image picked up by the image pickup device; and a position data sending unit configured to send position data to the information processing device, the position data indicating a position of the vehicle when the first image is picked up, and the information processing device includes: a position data receiving unit configured to receive the position data from the position data sending unit; a second image acquiring unit configured to acquire a plurality of second images for machine learning, the plurality of second images being relevant to the position of the vehicle based on the position data; a grouping unit configured to divide the plurality of second images into a plurality of groups based on a parameter indicating a condition at time of image pickup; and an analyzing unit configured to analyze a balance among the plurality of groups, the balance being a balance of the number of the second images that belong to the plurality of groups, wherein the vehicle further includes: an analysis result receiving unit configured to receive an analysis result by the analyzing unit; a selecting unit configured to select a third image from the first image based on the analysis result, the third image being an image by which the balance is adjusted; and an image sending unit configured to send the third image to the information processing device, and the information processing device further includes: an image receiving unit configured to receive the third image from the vehicle; and a learning unit configured to perform learning based on the second images and the third image, and to generate a learning database.
3. The image processing system according to claim 1, wherein the vehicle further includes: a map data acquiring unit configured to acquire map data indicating a current position of the vehicle, a destination and a way from the current position to the destination; and a guiding unit configured to perform a guide of a route on which the vehicle travels, based on the map data and the learning database, and the guiding unit is configured to perform a guide of an intersection using a landmark.
4. The image processing system according to claim 2, wherein the vehicle further includes: a map data acquiring unit configured to acquire map data indicating a current position of the vehicle, a destination and a way from the current position to the destination; and a guiding unit configured to perform a guide of a route on which the vehicle travels, based on the map data and the learning database, and the guiding unit is configured to perform a guide of an intersection using a landmark.
5. An image processing system comprising: a vehicle; and an information processing device, wherein the vehicle includes: an image pickup device; a first image acquiring unit configured to acquire a first image that shows a periphery of the vehicle, the first image picked up by the image pickup device; and a position data sending unit configured to send position data to the information processing device, the position data indicating a position of the vehicle when the first image is picked up, and the information processing device includes: a position data receiving unit configured to receive the position data from the position data sending unit; a second image acquiring unit configured to acquire a plurality of second images for machine learning, the plurality of second images being relevant to the position of the vehicle based on the position data; a grouping unit configured to divide the plurality of second images into a plurality of groups based on a parameter indicating a condition at time of image pickup; and an analyzing unit configured to analyze a balance among the plurality of groups, the balance being a balance of the number of the second images that belong to the plurality of groups, wherein the parameter is a position at which the second image is picked up, a road on which the second image is picked up, a time at which the second image is picked up, a weather, a vehicle type of a vehicle that picks up the second image, a model of the image pickup device, control information about the vehicle that picks up the second image, a congestion condition around the position at which the second image is picked up, a crowded condition around the position at which the second image is picked up, a space condition around the position at which the second image is picked up, a vehicle speed of the vehicle that picks up the second image, a lane on which the vehicle that picks up the second image is positioned, or a combination thereof.
6. The image processing system according to claim 5, wherein the vehicle further includes: a map data acquiring unit configured to acquire map data indicating a current position of the vehicle, a destination and a way from the current position to the destination; and a guiding unit configured to perform a guide of a route on which the vehicle travels, based on the map data and the learning database, and the guiding unit is configured to perform a guide of an intersection using a landmark.
