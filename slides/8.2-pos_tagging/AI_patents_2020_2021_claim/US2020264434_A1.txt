<claims>
1. An electronic device comprising: an optical system configured to generate light for implementing an image; and a display configured to emit the light generated from the optical system to an exit location set according to an incident location and an incident angle, wherein the optical system includes: a light source, and a reflector having a shape bent at a different angle with respect to the display while reflecting the light generated by the light source to the display.
2. The electronic device of claim 1, wherein the reflector includes: a first reflection part tilted at a first angle with respect to the display, and a second reflection part integrally coupled with the first reflection part and tilted at a second angle different from the first angle.
3. The electronic device of claim 2, wherein the display includes a photopolymer configured to selectively reflect the light according to the incident angle of the light for each location of the display, the photopolymer being recorded by a hologram recording.
4. The electronic device of claim 3, wherein the display is further configured to: emit first incident light reflected on the first reflection part to a first location, and emit second incident light reflected on the second reflection part to a second location spaced apart from the first location by a predetermined distance.
5. The electronic device of claim 1, wherein the light source generates laser light sprayed and propagated to a front surface of the reflector.
6. The electronic device of claim 1, further comprising: a frame including at least one opening, wherein the frame includes a front frame including the at least one opening and first and second side frames extended from of the front frame, and wherein the optical system is fastened to any one of the first and second side frames.
7. The electronic device of claim 6, wherein the display is positioned at the at least one opening in the frame.
8. An electronic device comprising: an optical system configured to generate light for implementing an image; and a display configured to emit the light generated from the optical system to an exit location set according to an incident location and an incident angle, wherein the optical system includes: a light source, a reflector configured to rotate around a horizontal or vertical axis while reflecting the light generated by the light source to the display, and a driving part configured to rotate the reflector.
9. The electronic device of claim 8, wherein the reflector is further configured to reflect the light to the display at different incident angles according to a tilting angle by being rotated by the driving part by rotating and driving.
10. The electronic device of claim 9, wherein the display is further configured to: emit first incident light reflected on the reflector tilted at a first angle with respect to the display to a first location, and emit second incident light reflected on the reflector tilted at a second angle different from the first angle to a second location spaced apart from the first location by a predetermined distance.
11. The electronic device of claim 8, wherein the reflector includes a stopper for limiting the reflector to be tilted within a predetermined angle range with respect to the display.
12. The electronic device of claim 8, wherein the display includes a photopolymer configured to selectively reflect the light according to the incident angle of the light for each location of the display, the photopolymer being recorded by a hologram recording.
13. The electronic device of claim 8, wherein the light source generates laser light sprayed and propagated to a front surface of the reflector.
14. The electronic device of claim 8, further comprising: a frame including at least one opening, wherein the frame includes a front frame including the at least one opening and first and second side frames extended from both ends of the front frame, and wherein the optical system is fastened to any one of the first and second side frames.
15. The electronic device of claim 14, wherein the display is positioned at the at least one opening.
16. The electronic device of claim 2, wherein the reflector further includes: a third reflection part integrally coupled with the second reflection part and tilted at a third angle different from the first and second angles, wherein the second reflection part is disposed between the first and third reflection parts.
17. The electronic device of claim 4, wherein the predetermined distance corresponds to a distance between two pupils of a user.
18. The electronic device of claim 10, wherein the predetermined distance corresponds to a distance between two pupils of a user.
