VEHICLE OCCUPANCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND METHODS
</title>

<abstract>
Example vehicle occupancy management systems and methods are described. In one implementation, a method receives a current vehicle image representing a current interior of a vehicle. An occupancy management system detects at least one passenger in the vehicle based on the current vehicle image and determines a seating location of the passenger. A seat map is generated that identifies the seating location of the passenger in the vehicle.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving a current vehicle image representing a current interior of a vehicle; detecting, by an occupancy management system, at least one passenger in the vehicle based on the current vehicle image; determining, by the occupancy management system, a seating location of the passenger; and generating, by the occupancy management system, a seat map identifying the seating location of the passenger in the vehicle.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining an identity of the passenger by performing facial recognition using the current vehicle image.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising adjusting at least one vehicle setting or operating parameter based on the identity of the passenger.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising identifying characteristics of the passenger based on the current vehicle image.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the characteristics of the passenger include at least one of passenger clothing, passenger facial characteristics, and passenger hair characteristics.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein the characteristics of the passenger are associated with the seat map.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising estimating at least one of an age, a weight, a height, a gender, and an emotion of the passenger.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: detecting a plurality of passengers in the vehicle based on the current vehicle image; determining, by the occupancy management system, a seating location of each of the plurality of passengers; and generating, by the occupancy management system, a seat map identifying the seating location of each of the plurality of passengers in the vehicle.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising accessing an empty vehicle image representing the vehicle interior without any passengers, wherein detecting at least one passenger in the vehicle includes comparing the empty vehicle image to the current vehicle image.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein comparing the empty vehicle image to the current vehicle image includes subtracting the empty vehicle image from the current vehicle image.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the vehicle is an autonomous vehicle.
12. A method comprising: receiving a current vehicle image representing a current interior of a vehicle; detecting, by an occupancy management system, a plurality of passengers in the vehicle based on the current vehicle image; determining, by the occupancy management system, a seating location of each of the plurality of passengers; determining, by the occupancy management system, an identity of each of the plurality of passengers by performing facial recognition using the current vehicle image; and generating, by the occupancy management system, a seat map that includes the identity and seating location of each of the plurality of passengers in the vehicle.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising adjusting at least one vehicle setting or operating parameter based on the identity of at least one of the plurality of passengers.
14. The method of claim 12, further comprising identifying characteristics of at least one of the plurality of passengers based on the current vehicle image.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the characteristics of the passenger include at least one of passenger clothing, passenger facial characteristics, and passenger hair characteristics.
16. The method of claim 12, further comprising accessing an empty vehicle image representing the vehicle interior without any passengers, wherein detecting a plurality of passengers in the vehicle includes comparing the empty vehicle image to the current vehicle image.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein comparing the empty vehicle image to the current vehicle image includes subtracting the empty vehicle image from the current vehicle image.
18. An apparatus comprising: a communication manager configured to receive a current vehicle image representing a current interior of a vehicle; an image processing module configured to detect a passenger in the vehicle based on the current vehicle image, wherein the image processing module is further configured to determine a seating location of the passenger; and a seat map generator configured to generate a seat map identifying the seating location of the passenger in the vehicle.
19. The apparatus of claim 18, further comprising a facial recognition module configured to determine an identity of the passenger.
20. The apparatus of claim 18, wherein the image processing module is further configured to access an empty vehicle image representing the vehicle interior without any passengers, wherein the image processing module detects the passenger in the vehicle by comparing the empty vehicle image to the current vehicle image.
