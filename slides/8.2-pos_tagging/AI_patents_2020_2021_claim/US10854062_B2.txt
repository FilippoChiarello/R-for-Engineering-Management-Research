<title>
Fire monitoring system
</title>

<abstract>
A monitor image in a monitor region captured by a monitor camera is divided into a plurality of block images, which are inputted to a fire detector constituted by a multi-layer-type neural network so as to detect a fire. A learning image generation device divides a learning image in which a fire in the monitor region is captured into a plurality of block images and classifies the images to fire learning block images, normal learning block images, or non-learning block images based upon the presence/absence of flames and smoke and the ratio at which the flames and smoke occupy in each block image so as to be stored, and a learning control part inputs the fire learning block images and the normal learning block images stored in the learning image generation device to the fire detector so as to subject a multi-layer-type neural network to learning by deep learning process.

<claims>
1. A fire monitoring system comprising: an image capturing part for capturing a monitor image in a monitor region; an image input part for dividing the monitor image into a plurality of block images as determining images by inputting the monitor image; a multi-layer-type neural network for determining a flame block in which a flame is detected or a smoke block in which smoke is detected or a normal block in which neither a flame nor smoke is detected by inputting each of the block images as determining images; a determination part for determining a fire in the monitor region based on the flame block and the smoke block; a learning image generation part for dividing the monitor image serving into a plurality of block images as learning images and classifying each of the block images as learning images to a flame learning block image in which flames due to a fire occupy a ratio that is a predetermined ratio or more, a smoke learning block image in which smoke due to a fire occupies a ratio that is a predetermined ratio or more, a normal learning block image without flames or smoke, and a non-learning block image in which the proportion of flames and smoke is less than the predetermined proportion so as to be stored in a learning image storage part; and a learning control part for learning the multi-layer-type neural network by inputting the flame learning block image, smoke learning block image and the normal learning block image excluding the non-learning block image stored in the learning image storage part.
2. The fire monitoring system according to claim 1, wherein the block images divided by the learning image generation part are inputted to the multi-layer-type neural network so as to determine a kind of the block images and by using results of determination, the block images are classified and stored in the learning image storage part.
3. The fire monitoring system according to claim 1, wherein the determination part determines the fire in the monitor region when a distribution of the flame block and/or the smoke block upward and/or expanded as time elapses.
4. The fire monitoring system according to claim 1, wherein the determination part determines the fire in the monitor region based upon a state of a set of flame blocks and/or smoke blocks.
5. The fire monitoring system according to claim 1, further comprising: a monitor part for displaying the monitor image on a screen, wherein the monitor part displays overlaid areas of the flame block and the smoke block on the monitor image so as to be able to recognize the area of the flame block and the smoke block respectively.
6. A fire monitoring system comprising: an image capturing part for capturing a monitor image in a monitor region; an image input part for dividing the monitor image into a plurality of block images as determining images by inputting the monitor image; a first multi-layer-type neural network for determining a flame block in which a flame is detected or a normal block in which no flame is detected by inputting each of the block images as determining images; a second multi-layer-type neutral network for determining a smoke block in which smoke is detected or a normal block in which no smoke is detected by inputting each of the block images as determining images; a determination part for determining a fire in the monitor region based on the flame block and the smoke block; a learning image generation part for dividing the monitor image serving into a plurality of block images as learning images and classifying each of the block images as learning images to a flame learning block image in which flames due to a fire occupy a ratio that is a predetermined ratio or more, a smoke learning block image in which smoke dues to a fire occupies a ratio that is a predetermined ratio or more, a normal learning block image without flames or smoke, and a non-learning block image in which the proportion of flames and smoke is less than the predetermined proportion so as to be stored in a learning image storage part; and a learning control part for learning the first multi-layer-type neural network by inputting the flame learning block image and the normal learning block image stored in the learning image storage part, and learning the second multi-layer-type neural network by for inputting the smoke learning block image and the normal learning block image stored in the learning image storage part.
7. The fire monitoring system according to claim 6, further comprising: a monitor part for displaying the monitor image on a screen, wherein the monitor part displays overlaid areas of the flame block and the smoke block on the monitor image so as to be able to recognize the area of the flame block and the smoke block respectively.
8. The fire monitoring system according to claim 6, wherein the determination part determines the fire in the monitor region when a distribution of the flame blocks and/or the smoke blocks upward and/or expands as time elapses.
