Servicing of autonomous vehicles
</title>

<abstract>
A method includes generating a plurality of training vectors relating to different respective historical service requests generated by respective autonomous vehicles, each of the training vectors including respective features associated with the historical request to which the training vector relates. The method further includes, using the training vectors, training a model configured to generate a prediction relating to one or more future service requests, generating the prediction using the model, and outputting the generated prediction. Other embodiments are also described.

<claims>
1. A system, comprising: a data storage; and a processor, configured to: retrieve data from the data storage; based on the data, generate a plurality of training vectors relating to different respective historical service requests generated by respective autonomous vehicles, each of the training vectors including respective features associated with the historical request to which the training vector relates; using the training vectors, train a model configured to generate a prediction relating to one or more future service requests; using the model, generate the prediction; and output the generated prediction.
2. The system according to claim 1, wherein the historical requests include historical requests for assistance issued to a remote support staff, and wherein the future requests include future requests for assistance.
3. The system according to claim 2, wherein the historical requests for assistance include historical requests for navigational assistance, and wherein the future requests for assistance include future requests for navigational assistance.
4. The system according to claim 2, wherein the prediction includes a predicted number of support-staff members required to service the future requests during a predefined interval of time.
5. The system according to claim 1, wherein the historical requests include historical requests for maintenance, and wherein the future requests include future requests for maintenance.
6. The system according to claim 1, wherein the prediction includes a start of an interval of time during which a particular one of the vehicles will next generate one of the future requests.
7. The system according to claim 1, wherein the prediction is for one of the future requests being generated during a predefined interval of time.
8. The system according to claim 1, wherein the prediction includes a predicted number of the future requests during a predefined interval of time.
9. The system according to claim 1, wherein the features include weather conditions at a time of the historical request.
10. The system according to claim 1, wherein the features include a health score of the autonomous vehicle that generated the historical request at a time of the historical request.
11. A method, comprising: generating a plurality of training vectors relating to different respective historical service requests generated by respective autonomous vehicles, each of the training vectors including respective features associated with the historical request to which the training vector relates; using the training vectors, training a model configured to generate a prediction relating to one or more future service requests; using the model, generating the prediction; and outputting the generated prediction.
12. The method according to claim 11, wherein the historical requests include historical requests for assistance issued to a remote support staff, and wherein the future requests include future requests for assistance.
13. The method according to claim 12, wherein the historical requests for assistance include historical requests for navigational assistance, and wherein the future requests for assistance include future requests for navigational assistance.
14. The method according to claim 12, wherein the prediction includes a predicted number of support-staff members required to service the future requests during a predefined interval of time.
15. The method according to claim 11, wherein the historical requests include historical requests for maintenance, and wherein the future requests include future requests for maintenance.
16. The method according to claim 11, wherein the prediction includes a start of an interval of time during which a particular one of the vehicles will next generate one of the future requests.
17. The method according to claim 11, wherein the prediction is for one of the future requests being generated during a predefined interval of time.
18. The method according to claim 11, wherein the prediction includes a predicted number of the future requests during a predefined interval of time.
19. The method according to claim 11, wherein the features include weather conditions at a time of the historical request.
20. The method according to claim 11, wherein the features include a health score of the autonomous vehicle that generated the historical request at a time of the historical request.
21. A computer software product comprising a tangible non-transitory computer-readable medium in which program instructions are stored, which instructions, when read by a processor, cause the processor to: generate a plurality of training vectors relating to different respective historical service requests generated by respective autonomous vehicles, each of the training vectors including respective features associated with the historical request to which the training vector relates; using the training vectors, train a model configured to generate a prediction relating to one or more future service requests; using the model, generate the prediction; and output the generated prediction.
