<title>
Personalized assessment of bone health
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method for personalized assessment of a subject's bone health includes extracting a plurality of features of interest from non-invasive subject data, medical images of the subject, and subject-specific bone turnover marker values. A surrogate model and the plurality of features of interest are used to predict one or more subject-specific measures of interest related to bone health. Then, a visualization of the one or more subject-specific measures of interest related to bone health is generated.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A computer-implemented method for personalized assessment of a subject's bone health, the method comprising: extracting a plurality of features of interest from non-invasive subject data, medical images of the subject, and subject-specific bone turnover marker values; using a surrogate model and the plurality of features of interest to predict one or more subject-specific measures of interest related to bone health; and generating a visualization of the one or more subject-specific measures of interest related to bone health; wherein the surrogate model is trained by a process comprising: retrieving training data comprising one or more of (i) a plurality of bone anatomical models and (ii) a plurality of in-vitro models from a database; performing FEM-based computations using the plurality of bone anatomical models or stress-experiments using the plurality of in-vitro models to yield FEM results; extracting one or more measures of interest from the FEM results; extracting a plurality of geometric features from the plurality of bone anatomical models; and training the surrogate model to predict the one or more measures of interest based on the plurality of geometric features using a machine learning algorithm.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the measures of interest comprise one or more of stress and stress strain.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein at least a portion of the training data comprises synthetic data.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the synthetic data is generated by: generating one or more baseline models; randomly or systematically perturbing the baseline models to obtain a plurality of synthetic models comprising one or more of (i) synthetic bone anatomical models and (ii) synthetic in-vitro models.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the baseline models are subject-specific anatomical models.
6. The method of claim 3, wherein the synthetic data comprises one or more of (i) synthetic bone anatomical models and (ii) synthetic in-vitro models generated according to a set of rules using one or more randomly or systematically perturbed parameter values.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: associating each of the one or more subject-specific measures of interest with a point on a subject image; and displaying the subject image; and in response to receive a user selection of a selected point on the subject image, displaying a particular subject-specific measures of interest corresponding to the selected point.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: associating each of the one or more subject-specific measures of interest with a point on a subject image; and displaying the subject image color coded based on values of the subject-specific measures of interest.
9. A parallel processing computing system comprising: a host computer configured to extract a plurality of features of interest from non-invasive subject data, medical images of a subject, and subject-specific bone turnover marker values; and a device computer configured to use a surrogate model and the plurality of features of interest to predict one or more subject-specific measures of interest related to bone health, wherein the surrogate model is trained by a process comprising: retrieving training data comprising one or more of (i) a plurality of bone anatomical models and (ii) a plurality of in-vitro models from a database; performing FEM-based computations using the plurality of bone anatomical models or stress-experiments using the plurality of in-vitro models to yield FEM results; extracting one or more measures of interest from the FEM results; extracting a plurality of geometric features from the plurality of bone anatomical models; and training the surrogate model to predict the one or more measures of interest based on the plurality of geometric features using a machine learning algorithm.
