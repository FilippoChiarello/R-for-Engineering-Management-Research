EXTENSION DEVICE FOR AN AUTOMATION DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to an extension device (MI) for one or more automation devices (DEV) in an industrial system (100). The invention particularly relates to industrial data processing units (PU) capable of performing data processing based on one or more artificial neural networks. To enable and/or accelerate one or more computations (C1,...,Cn) in an industrial system (100), thereby simplifying the integration of artificial intelligence into the industrial system (100), and to simplify data exchange between an extension device (MI) capable of processing data using artificial intelligence and an automation device (DEV) the invention proposes to obtain (S2) one or more results (R1,...,Rn) of the one or more computations (C1,...,Cn), wherein the results (R1,...,Rn) indicate one or more states (S1,...,Sn) of the industrial system (100) and to provide (S3) the one or more results (R1,...,Rn) via a process state model (PM) shared with the automation device (DEV) to monitor and/or control the industrial system (100) .
