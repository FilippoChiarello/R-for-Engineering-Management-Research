METHODS OF DIAGNOSING AND TREATING PARTICULAR CAUSAL COMPONENTS OF CHRONIC PAIN IN A PATIENT
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure teaches systems and methods of diagnosing and treating the distinct biologic components that contribute to chronic pain symptoms experienced by patients. A biologic sample is obtained from a patient. Levels of two or more biomarkers (e.g., methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, xanthurenic acid, 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid (3-HPMA), pyroglutamate, hydroxymethylglutarate (HMG), quinolinic acid, kynurenine acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetate (5-HIAA), vanilmandelate (VMA), and ethylmalonic acid) in the biologic sample are experimentally determined. Based on the existence of abnormal results in one or more biomarkers the patient is diagnosed as having the nerve health, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation pain, and/or neurotransmitter pain components to their chronic pain. Based on the resulting diagnoses administration of certain support compounds is directed. The patient may retest after a sufficient period of time to observe any longitudinal differences in the test results and adjust treatment accordingly. Further, the biomarker data gathered from pain-neutral and chronic pain patients (particularly those using opioid therapies) will be used to characterize biochemistries going forward.

<claims>
1. A method of diagnosing and treating distinct biologic components contributing to chronic pain experienced by a patient, the method comprising: a) obtaining a biologic sample on a sample date from the patient experiencing chronic pain; b) determining the levels of each of two or more biomarkers found in the biologic sample, wherein the two or more biomarkers are selected from the group: methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, xanthurenic acid, 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid (3-HPMA), pyroglutamate, hydroxymethylglutarate (HMG), quinolinic acid, kynurenine acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetate (5-HIAA), vanilmandelate (VMA), and ethylmalonic acid; c) diagnosing the patient as having a nerve health pain component to their chronic pain upon determining an abnormal level of one or all of methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, xanthurenic acid, and 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid (3-HPMA) and then directing the administration of an effective amount of one or more nerve health support compounds to the patient diagnosed as having the nerve health pain component to their chronic pain; d) diagnosing the patient as having an oxidative stress pain component to their chronic pain upon determining an abnormal level of one or all of pyroglutamate, ethylmalonic acid, and hydroxymethylglutarate (HMG) and then then directing the administration of an effective amount of one or more oxidative stress support compounds to the patient diagnosed as having the oxidative stress pain component to their chronic pain; e) diagnosing the patient as having a chronic inflammation pain component to their chronic pain upon determining an abnormal level of one or both of quinolinic acid and kynurenine acid and then directing the administration of an effective amount of one or more chronic inflammation support compounds to the patient diagnosed as having the chronic inflammation pain component to their chronic pain; and f) diagnosing the patient as having a neurotransmitter pain component to their chronic pain upon determining an abnormal level of one or both of 5-hydroxyindoleacetate (5-HIAA) and vanilmandelate (VMA) and then then directing the administration of an effective amount of one or more neurotransmitter support compounds to the patient diagnosed as having the neurotransmitter pain component to their chronic pain.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the biologic sample is urine, the method further comprising: a) determining the level of creatinine found in the biologic sample: and b) normalizing the determined levels of each of the two or more biomarkers found in the biologic sample based on the determined level of creatinine.
3. The method of claim 2 further comprising combining the normalized levels of each of the two or more biomarkers found in the biologic sample into a composite pain index.
4. The method of claim 3 further comprising categorizing the composite chronic pain index into a composite chronic pain range selected from the group comprising: a low likelihood that the patient's biochemistry is contributing to their chronic pain, a moderate likelihood that the patient's biochemistry is contributing to their chronic pain, a moderately high likelihood that the patient's biochemistry is contributing to their chronic pain, and a high likelihood that the patient's biochemistry is contributing to their chronic pain.
5. The method of claim 4 further comprising saving a set of patient pain data in electronic memory in association with the sample date and a unique patient ID, the set of patient pain data including one or more of the composite chronic pain index, the composite chronic pain range, and the normalized levels of each of the two or more biomarkers found in the biologic sample.
6. The method of claim 5 further comprising graphically displaying one or more sets of patient pain data associated with the unique patient ID in order of the sample date associated with each set.
7. The method of claim 3, wherein the composite biomarker score is determined through quantitative assessment of a biological markers of one or more of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, micronutrient status, neurotransmitter synthesis and turnover.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the composite biomarker score is determined using a statistical or chemometric technique, preferably multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).
9. The method of claim 8, wherein said composite biomarker score is determined by comparing said biomarker levels in pain patients to those of healthy control pain free subjects with no history of chronic pain or opioid use.
10. The method of claim 3, wherein said composite biomarker score is used as a predictive tool to identify patients who have a high probably of responding well to interventional pain therapies such as neuromodulation techniques selected from the group comprising: spinal cord stimulation, intrathecal pump therapy, and peripheral nerve stimulation.
11. The method of claim 3, wherein said composite biomarker score is used to provide a non-opioid pain management plan, comprising the step of administering a treatment that directly modulates and/or targets one or more abnormal biomarker findings.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein said composite biomarker score is provided before, during, or after the step of reducing opioid administration in an individual, preferably wherein said composite marker score is used with an opioid weaning or opioid reduction program.
13. The method of claim 3, wherein said composite biomarker score is used to determine a personalized, non-opioid therapy to increase the efficacy of current pain management techniques, wherein said individual is administered said personalized, non-opioid therapy in conjunction with a traditional pain therapy selected from analgesic medications, intervention pain therapies, physical therapy, NSAID therapy, opioids, or combinations thereof.
14.
