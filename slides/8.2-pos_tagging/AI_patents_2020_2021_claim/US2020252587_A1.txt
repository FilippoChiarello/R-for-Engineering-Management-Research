VIDEO CAMERA
</title>

<abstract>
A video camera, a computer-implemented method, and a computer-readable storage medium. The video camera including one or more microphones and a processor. The processor is configured to: acquire an output from the or each microphone; apply one or more pre-analysis filters to the or each acquired output, wherein the or each pre-analysis filter determines if the or each acquired output contains a corresponding predetermined feature of interest; and analyse the or each output, when it is determined by the or each pre-analysis filter that the corresponding output contains at least one predetermined feature of interest.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A video camera including one or more microphones and a processor, wherein the processor is configured to: acquire an output from the or each microphone; apply one or more pre-analysis filters to the or each acquired output, wherein the or each pre-analysis filter determines if the or each acquired output contains a corresponding predetermined feature of interest; and analyse the or each output, when it is determined by the or each pre-analysis filter that the corresponding output contains at least one predetermined feature of interest.
2. The video camera of claim 1, wherein the or each pre-analysis filter removes true-negative data from the or each acquired output.
3. The video camera of claim 2, wherein the analysis is performed when it is determined by the or each pre-analysis filter that the corresponding output contains at least one predetermined feature of interest and when a remaining amount of data in the or each acquired output, after the pre-analysis filter has removed the true-negative data, exceeds a threshold.
4. The video camera of claim 3, wherein the threshold is determined, in part, on an amount of queued data to be processed.
5. The video camera of claim 1, including plural microphones, and wherein the processor is configured, before applying the one or more pre-analysis filters, to combine the outputs from two or more of the plurality of microphones to form a virtual microphone.
6. The video camera of claim 5, wherein the combination is performed by beamforming and/or source separation.
7. The video camera of claim 1, wherein processor is configured to add the or each acquired output to a queue when it is determined that the or each output contains at least one predetermined feature of interest, and is configured to analyse the or each output asynchronously with the step of applying the one or more pre-analysis filters to subsequently acquired outputs.
8. The video camera of claim 1, wherein the at least one predetermined feature of interest is selected from the list of: a noise louder in volume than an average volume or threshold volume; a noise having a shorter duration than an average duration or threshold duration; a noise corresponding to glass breaking; a noise corresponding to a gunshot; and a noise corresponding to a voice.
9. The video camera of claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to apply the one or more pre-analysis filters to a first time window of the or each acquired output, and is configured to analyse a second time window of the corresponding output, wherein the second time window is larger than the first time window.
10. The video camera of claim 1, including plural microphones, and the processor is configured to combine the outputs of the microphones before analysis using a weighted sum.
11. The video camera of claim 10, wherein the weighted sum is derived using one or more weighting factors selected from the list including: a binary choice, based on whether the respective output meets a threshold; a value based on a probability derived by the corresponding filter; and a pre-set weighting value.
12. The video camera of claim 1, wherein the or each pre-analysis filter outputs either a binary value indicating whether the acquired output contains a predetermined feature of interest, or a confidence value indicating a probability of the acquired output containing a predetermined feature of interest.
13. A computer-implemented method of analysing one or more outputs acquired from one or more microphones of a video camera, the method including the steps, performed by a processor of the video camera, of: acquiring an output from the or each microphone; applying one or more pre-analysis filters to the or each acquired output, wherein the or each pre-analysis filter determines if the or each acquired output contains a corresponding predetermined feature of interest; and analyse the or each output, when it is determined by the or each pre-analysis filter that the corresponding output contains at least one predetermined feature of interest.
14. The computer-implemented method of claim 13, wherein the or each pre-analysis filter removes true negative data from the or each acquired output.
15. The computer-implemented method of claim 14, wherein the step of analysing is performed when it is determined by the or each pre-analysis filter that the corresponding output contains at least one predetermined feature of interest and when a remaining amount of data in the or each acquired output, after the pre-analysis filter has removed the true-negative data, exceeds a threshold.
16. The computer-implemented method of claim 15, wherein the threshold is determined, in part, on an amount of queued data to be processed.
17. The computer-implemented method of claim 13, wherein there are plural microphones, and, before applying the one or more pre-analysis filters, the processor combines the outputs from two or more of the plurality of microphones to form a virtual microphone.
18. The computer-implemented method of claim 17, wherein the combination is performed by beamforming and/or source separation.
19. The computer-implemented method of claim 13, wherein the processor adds the or each output to a queue when it is determined that the or each acquired output contains at least one predetermined feature of interest, and analyses the or each output asynchronously with the step of applying the one or more pre-analysis filters to subsequently acquired outputs.
20. The computer-implemented method of claim 13, wherein the processor applies the one or more pre-analysis filters to a first time window of the or each acquired output, and analyses a second time window of the corresponding output, wherein the second time window is larger than the first time window.
