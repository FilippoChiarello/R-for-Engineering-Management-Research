METHOD AND COMPUTER NETWORK FOR GATHERING EVALUATION INFORMATION FROM USERS
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a method for gathering evaluation information from a user with a computer network (10), the computer network (10) performing the following: - receiving an initial set of predetermined response tasks (RT.1, RT.2, RT.k), each response task (RT.1, RT.2, RT.k) including a number of predetermined response options (50, 52), wherein based on the response options (50, 52) selected by a user, evaluation information for evaluating at least one predetermined characteristic (C1, C2) can be determined; - outputting, via a computer device (20.1, 20.2, 20.K, 12, 21) of said computer network (10), at least one free-formulation response task (RTF) to at least one user by means of which an at least partially freely formulated response can be received from the user; - identifying, via a computer device (20.1, 20.2, 20.K, 12, 21) of said computer network (10), evaluation information based on the freely formulated response, said evaluation information being usable for evaluating the at least one predetermined characteristic (C1, C2); - generating, via a computer device (20.1, 20.2, 20.K, 12, 21) of said computer network (10), an adjusted set (60) of response tasks (RT.1, RT.2, RT.k) based on the identified evaluation information. Also, the invention relates to a computer network (10) for gathering evaluation information for at least one predetermined characteristic (C1, C2) from at least one user.

<claims>
1. Method for gathering evaluation information from a user with a computer network (10), the computer network (10) performing the following:
receiving an initial set of predetermined response tasks (RT.1 , RT.2, RT.k), each response task (RT.1 , RT.2, RT.k) including a number of predetermined response options (50, 52), wherein based on the response options (50, 52) selected by a user, evaluation information for evaluating at least one predetermined characteristic (C1 , C2) can be determined;
outputting, via a computer device (20.1 , 20.2, 20. K, 12, 21 ) of said computer network (10), at least one free-formulation response task (RTF) to at least one user by means of which an at least partially freely formulated response can be received from the user;
identifying, via a computer device (20.1 , 20.2, 20. K, 12, 21 ) of said computer network (10), evaluation information based on the freely formulated response, said evaluation information being usable for evaluating the at least one predetermined characteristic (C1 , C2);
generating, via a computer device (20.1 , 20.2, 20. K, 12, 21 ) of said computer network (10), an adjusted set (60) of response tasks (RT.1 , RT.2, RT.k) based on the identified evaluation information.
2. Method according to claim 1 ,
wherein the freely formulated response is at least partially based on one of:
a text response;
a speech response; or
a behavioural characteristics of the respondent.
3. Method according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein the free-formulation response task (RTF) asks the user to provide feedback on certain topic.
4. Method according to one of the proceeding claims,
wherein generating the adjusted set (60) of predetermined response tasks (RT.1 , RT.2, RT.k) includes:
- reducing the number of response tasks (RT.1 , RT.2, RT.k) and/or response options within the initial set of predetermined response tasks.
5. Method according to claim 4,
wherein those response tasks (RT.1 , RT.2, RT.k) and/or response options (50, 52) are removed which are provided to gather evaluation information which have already been identified based on the freely formulated response.
6. Method according to one of the proceeding claims,
wherein generating the adjusted set (60) of predetermined response tasks (RT.1 , RT.2, RT.k) includes:
- selecting certain of the response tasks (RT.1 , RT.2, RT.k) from said initial set of
predetermined response tasks (RT.1 , RT.2, RT.k), the selected response tasks making up the adjusted set (60) of predetermined response tasks.
7. Method according to one of the proceeding claims,
wherein the identification of evaluation information based on the freely formulated response is performed with a computer model (100) that has been generated based on machine learning.
8. Method according to claim 7,
wherein the computer model (100) determines and/or defines a relation between contents of the freely formulated response and evaluation information for the at least one characteristic (C1 , C2).
9. Method according to claim 7 or 8,
wherein by means of the computer model (100) an evaluation score (ES) is computed, indicating how the characteristic (C1 , C2) is evaluated.
10. Method according to according to claim 9,
wherein by means of the computer model (100) a confidence score (CS) is computed, indicating a confidence level of the computed evaluation score (ES).
11. Method according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein the computer model (100) comprises and/or is generated based on an artificial neural network.
12. Method according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein a completeness score is computed indicating a level of completeness of the gathered evaluation information based on responses received from a plurality of users.
13. Computer network (10) for gathering evaluation information for at least one predetermined characteristic (C1 , C2) from at least one user,
wherein the computer network (10) has an initial set of predetermined response tasks (RT.1 , RT.2, RT.k), each response task (RT.1 , RT.2, RT.k) comprising a number of predetermined response options (50, 52), wherein based on the response options (50, 52) selected by a user, evaluation information for evaluating at least one predetermined characteristic (C1 , C2) can be determined; and wherein the computer network (10) comprises at least one processing unit (23) that is configured to execute any of the following software modules, stored in a data storage unit (22, 26) of the computer network (10):
a free-formulation output software module (101 ) that is configured to provide at least one free-formulation response task (RTF) by means of which a freely formulated response can be received from at least one user;
a free-formulation analysis software module (102) that is configured to analyse the freely formulated response and to thereby identify evaluation information contained therein, said evaluation information being usable for evaluating the at least one predetermined characteristic;
a response set adjusting software module (103) that is configured generate an adjusted set (60) of response tasks (RT.1 , RT.2, RT.k) based on the evaluation information identified by the free-formulation analysis software module (102).
