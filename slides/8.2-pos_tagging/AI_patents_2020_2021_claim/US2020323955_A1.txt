COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR TREATING PULMONARY HYPERTENSION
</title>

<abstract>
In some aspects, the invention teaches pharmaceutical compositions that include a TGF-β ligand trap, and methods of using a TGF-β ligand trap to treat, prevent, or reduce the progression rate of pulmonary hypertension (PH). The invention also provides methods of using a TGF-β ligand trap to treat, prevent, or reduce the progression rate of a variety of conditions including, but not limited to, pulmonary vascular remodeling, pulmonary fibrosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, diseases associated with excessive TGF-β signaling, diseases associated with excessive GDF15 signaling, and diseases associated with excessive PAI-1 signaling. The invention further provides methods of using a TGF-β ligand trap to reduce right ventricular systolic pressure in a subject.

<claims>
1. 1.-35. (canceled)
36. A method of treating, preventing, or reducing the progression rate of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in a subject, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a polypeptide comprising a TGF-β ligand binding domain of a TGF-β type II receptor.
37. The method of claim 36, wherein the pulmonary hypertension is selected from the group consisting of venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, arterial, and miscellaneous.
38. The method of claim 36, wherein the PH is pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
39. The method of claim 36, wherein PH is mediated by excessive TGF-β signaling.
40. The method of claim 36, wherein the TGF-β ligand binding domain comprises an amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3.
41. The method of claim 36, wherein polypeptide further comprises an Fc domain of an immunoglobulin.
42. The method of claim 36, wherein the polypeptide further comprises a linker between the TGF-β ligand binding domain of the TGF-β type II receptor and the Fc domain.
43. The method of claim 36, wherein the polypeptide is a soluble recombinant TGF-β type II receptor Fc-fusion protein (TGFBRII-Fc).
44. The method of claim 42, wherein the TGFBRII-Fc comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least 80% identical to the sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1.
45. The method of claim 36, wherein the amount of polypeptide administered to the subject is between about 0.3 and about 3.0 mg/kg of body weight.
46. The method of claim 36, wherein the polypeptide is administered to the subject once per two weeks.
47. The method of claim 36, wherein the polypeptide is administered to the subject once per three weeks.
48. The method of claim 36, wherein the polypeptide is administered to the subject subcutaneously.
49. The method of claim 36, wherein the polypeptide is part of a pharmaceutical composition.
50. The method of claim 49, wherein the pharmaceutical composition is formulated for modified release, sustained release, controlled release, or a combination thereof.
51. The method of claim 36, wherein the polypeptide binds TGF-β1 or TGF-β3.
52. The method of claim 36, wherein the treatment improves one or more parameters of the subject selected from the group consisting of: distance walked in six minutes; blood brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels; arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure.
53. A method of treating, preventing, or reducing the progression rate of pulmonary vascular remodeling, pulmonary fibrosis, or right ventricular hypertrophy in a subject that has PH, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a polypeptide comprising a TGF-β ligand binding domain of a TGF-β type II receptor.
54. A method of treating, preventing, or reducing the progression rate of a pulmonary disease associated with excessive TGF-β signaling or excessive PAI-1 signaling in a subject, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a polypeptide comprising a TGF-β ligand binding domain of a TGF-β type II receptor.
55. A method of reducing right ventricular systolic pressure in a subject that has PH, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a polypeptide comprising a TGF-β ligand binding domain of a TGF-β type II receptor.
