WALKING ASSISTANCE METHOD AND APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
A method and apparatus for assisting walking of a user is provided. Information related to a motion of a user wearing a walking assistance apparatus is measured by an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a gait phase of the user corresponding to the measured information is predicted using data learned in advance through machine learning, an assistance torque to be provided to the user is determined based on the predicted gait phase, and a driver is controlled to output the assistance torque.
