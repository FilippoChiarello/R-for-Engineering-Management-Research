SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PROCESSING METADATA
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided herein for processing digital content. A registry includes a set of common registry identifiers used to classify metadata. Further, an interchange layer and registry classification service: receives metadata derived from digital content in a content file; and classifies the metadata, by associating the metadata with one of the common registry identifiers, based upon a classification from a set of classification rules that is associated with a metadata type of the metadata.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system for processing digital content comprising: a registry comprising a set of common registry identifiers used to classify metadata; and an interchange layer and registry classification service configured to: receive metadata derived from digital content in a content file; and classify the metadata, by associating the metadata with one of the common registry identifiers, based upon a classification from a set of classification rules that is associated with a metadata type of the metadata.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising: a database configured to store the metadata and an association with the one of the common registry identifiers.
3. The system of claim 2, further comprising an orchestration layer service configured to: perform one or more actions regarding the metadata, perform one or more actions regarding the digital content, or both.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the metadata type comprises a class type and an item type.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the common registry identifiers comprise a gross classification indication of a class of metadata and a specific classification associated with the class of metadata.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the registry identifiers comprise a string concatenating the gross classification indication and the specific indication with a separating symbol.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the separating symbol comprises a period.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the interchange layer and registry classification service comprises an application programming interface (API) configured to receive instructions regarding the metadata from a plurality of metadata sources.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the instructions result in automatic classification of the metadata to the one of the common registry identifiers.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the interchange layer and registry classification service comprises a data dictionary, the data dictionary comprising the set of classification rules for the metadata, and wherein the metadata is classified based on the data dictionary.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the interchange layer and registry classification service is configured to expand the set of classification rules to include additional classification rules using machine learning applied to unclassified metadata.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the machine learning uses known classification rules of a data dictionary as training data.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein when a gross classification of the unclassified metadata is known, the known classification rules comprise known classification rules associated with a subset of the metadata having a common gross classification as the unclassified metadata.
14. The system of claim 11, comprising a graphical user interface (GUI), configured to selectively enable a subset of the additional classification rules based upon a classification rule selection via the GUI.
15. The system of claim 1, wherein the interchange layer and registry classification service is configured to expand the set of common registry identifiers to include additional registry identifiers using machine learning applied to unclassified metadata.
16. The system of claim 15, comprising a graphical user interface (GUI), configured to selectively enable a subset of the additional registry identifiers based upon a registry identifier selection via the GUI.
17. A tangible, non-transitory, machine-readable medium, comprising computer-readable instructions that, when executed by one or more processors of a computer, cause the computer to: receive metadata derived from digital content in a content file; classify the metadata, by associating the metadata with one of a set of common registry identifiers, based upon a classification from a set of classification rules that is associated with a metadata type of the metadata; and store the metadata and an association with the one of the common registry identifiers.
18. The machine-readable medium of claim 17, wherein the computer-readable instructions, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the computer to: expand the set of classification rules to include additional classification rules using machine learning applied to unclassified metadata; expand the set of common registry identifiers to include additional registry identifiers using the machine learning applied to the unclassified metadata; or both.
19. A method, comprising: receiving, via one or more computers, metadata derived from digital content in a content file; classifying, via the one or more computers, the metadata, by associating the metadata with one of a plurality of common registry identifiers, based upon a classification from a set of classification rules that is associated with a metadata type of the metadata; and storing, in a data store, the metadata and an association with the one of the common registry identifiers, wherein the common registry identifiers comprise a concatenated string comprising a gross classification indication and a specific classification indication associated with the gross classification indication, separated by a symbol.
20. The method of claim 19, comprising classifying, via the one or more computers, at least a portion of the metadata with one or more production-specific registry identifiers of a production-specific registry that is independently associated with a content production.
