<title>
Ultrasound imaging apparatus with image selector
</title>

<abstract>
An ultrasound imaging system includes a cine buffer in which image frames produced during an examination are stored. A processor is programmed to select one or more image frames from the cine buffer for presentation to an operator for approval and inclusion in a patient record or other report. The operator can accept the proposed image frames or can select one or more other image frames from the cine buffer. The processor may select image frames at spaced intervals in the cine buffer for presentation. Alternatively, the processor compares image frames in the cine buffer with one or more target image frames. Image frames that are similar to the target image frames are presented to the operator to confirm. Alternatively, image frames can be selected by the processor that contain a specific feature or that are similar to image frames that were previously selected by the operator when performing a particular type of examination.

<claims>
We claim:
1. An ultrasound imaging system comprising: a transducer that is configured to transmit ultrasound signals to and receive ultrasound signals from a region of interest; receive circuitry that is configured to convert the received ultrasound signals into image frames of ultrasound data for display to an operator; a display for displaying the image frames of ultrasound data; a cine buffer in which a first plurality of image frames of ultrasound data produced during an examination time are stored; and a processor that is configured to determine a second plurality of the image frames from the first plurality that are stored at equally spaced time intervals within the cine buffer during the examination time, wherein the processor is configured select one or more image frames from the cine buffer for presentation to the operator based on the first plurality of the image frames, and to receive confirmation from the operator whether to mark one or more of the selected image frames for inclusion in a patient record or other report, the one or more image frames being selected as a result of the processor analyzing the one or more image frames without input from the operator.
2. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 1, further comprising a memory that stores one or more target image frames that are associated with particular examination types and wherein the processor is configured to compare the image frames that are stored in the cine buffer to one or more target images associated with a type of examination being performed by the operator.
3. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to receive a selection of an image frame by the operator and to display image frames that were recorded in the cine buffer before and/or after the selected image frame.
4. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to analyze image frames in the cine buffer and select for presentation one or more image frames that differ from an image frame that was stored before the selected image frame.
5. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to compare image frames in the cine buffer with one or more target image frames that the operator has previously selected when performing a type of examination and to select one or more image frames for presentation that match the target image frames.
6. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to analyze the image frames stored in the cine buffer for the presence of a defined feature and to present one or more image frames that contain the defined feature.
7. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 6, wherein the defined feature is an anatomical feature.
8. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 6, wherein the defined feature is a surgical instrument.
9. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 6, wherein the defined feature is a needle.
10. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 6, wherein the defined feature is a drug being delivered around a target location.
