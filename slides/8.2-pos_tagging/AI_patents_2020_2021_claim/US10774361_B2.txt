<title>
Microbe identification by mass spectrometry and infrared spectrometry
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a method for identifying unknown microbes in a sample, wherein a mass spectrometric determination down to the taxonomic level of the genus or species is supplemented by a detailed determination of a lower taxonomic level or variety by means of infrared spectrometry, using restricted reference libraries of infrared spectra. These libraries can be genus-specific, containing only infrared spectra of microbes of one genus, or species-specific, containing only infrared spectra of microbes of one species. In so doing, a robust mass spectrometric identification of the species of unknown microbes is advantageously supplemented with a detailed analysis of the subspecies and varieties by means of infrared spectrometry, primarily in order to identify medically important varieties such as pathovars like EHEC and EPEC, and antibiotic-resistant microbes like MRSA.

<claims>
1. A method for the identification of unknown microbes in a sample, wherein a mass spectrometric (MS) determination of an MS taxonomic level of the microbes, which reaches down to at least the genus of the microbes, is supplemented by a detailed determination of a resistance behavior of the microbes to one or more antibiotics by means of infrared (IR) spectrometry, where an IR spectral database specific to an IR taxonomic level is used for the detailed determination of the said antibiotic resistance behavior, the method comprising the steps of: (a) providing a library with reference mass spectra specific to an MS taxonomic level and IR spectral databases specific to an IR taxonomic level, (b) culturing a microbial isolate from the sample, (c) acquiring at least one mass spectrum, (d) performing said mass spectrometric determination of the MS taxonomic level of the microbial isolate, (e) selecting one of said IR spectral databases specific to the IR taxonomic level in accordance with the mass spectrometric determination, wherein the data in the IR spectral databases comprise culturing conditions for each identified microbe whose IR spectral data are part of the database, (f) culturing and preparing microbes of the isolate, (g) acquiring at least one infrared spectrum of the cultured and prepared microbes of the isolate, and (h) determining the said antibiotic resistance behavior with a mathematical-statistical classification method, using the said selected one of said IR spectral databases specific to the IR taxonomic level.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the MS taxonomic level determined mass spectrometrically is the species.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the preparation of the microbes comprises a selection and isolation of individual cell components, from which the at least one IR spectrum is then acquired.
4. The method according to claim 3, wherein the individual cell components are purified cell walls.
5. The method according to claim 3, further comprising using a fraction of the cell components which has been obtained by gradient centrifugation for the acquisition of the at least one IR spectrum.
6. The method according to claim 3, further comprising separating the individual cell components by one of centrifugation and filtration.
7. The method according to claim 1, further comprising using an IR sample support plate which comprises a substantially IR transparent material for acquiring the at least one infrared spectrum.
8. The method according to claim 7, wherein the IR sample support plate comprises zinc selenide or silicon.
9. The method according to claim 1, wherein the mass spectrometric determination of the MS taxonomic level is carried out by means of similarity comparisons between its mass spectra and reference mass spectra of microbes across substantially all taxonomic domains in the corresponding library.
10. The method according to claim 1, wherein the conditions conforming to the data in the said selected one of said IR spectral databases specific to the IR taxonomic level are used for the culturing and preparing of microbes of the isolate.
11. The method according to claim 10, wherein the culturing and preparing conditions include stipulations relating to at least one of nutrient medium, duration, temperature of the culture, oxygen and moisture content above the nutrient medium, type of sample preparation for an IR spectrometer, and a weighting scheme for individual sections of the IR spectra for the detailed determination.
12. The method according to claim 1, further comprising a three-stage method wherein a mass spectrometric determination of the genus of the microbial isolate is supplemented by detailed determinations of the species as well as the said antibiotic resistance behavior each using infrared spectrometry.
13. The method according to claim 12, wherein the antibiotic resistance behavior is a resistance to at least one of beta-lactam antibiotics, glycopeptide antibiotics, and methillicin.
14. The method according to claim 1, further comprising applying an individual set of culture and preparation conditions for each determined MS taxonomic level of microbe, each set of culture and preparation conditions being optimized for the detailed determination of the said antibiotic resistance behavior by infrared spectrometry.
