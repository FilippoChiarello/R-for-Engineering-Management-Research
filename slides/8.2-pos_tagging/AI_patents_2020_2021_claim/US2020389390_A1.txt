PER-FLOW CALL ADMISSION CONTROL USING A PREDICTIVE MODEL TO ESTIMATE TUNNEL QOS IN SD-WAN NETWORKS
</title>

<abstract>
In one embodiment, a device identifies a new traffic flow in a network. The device determines a service level agreement (SLA) associated with the new traffic flow. The device uses a machine learning model to predict whether a particular tunnel in the network can satisfy the determined SLA of the traffic were the traffic flow routed onto the tunnel. The device performs call admission control to route the new traffic flow onto the particular tunnel, based on a prediction that the tunnel can satisfy the determined SLA of the traffic.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: identifying, by a device, a new traffic flow in a network; identifying, by the device, a user identifier associated with the new traffic flow; determining, by the device, a service level agreement (SLA) associated with the new traffic flow based in part on calendar information associated with the user identifier; using, by the device, a machine learning model to predict whether a particular tunnel in the network can satisfy the determined SLA of the traffic were the traffic flow routed onto the tunnel; and performing, by the device, call admission control to route the new traffic flow onto the particular tunnel, based on a prediction that the tunnel can satisfy the determined SLA of the traffic.
2. The method as in claim 1, wherein the network is a software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN).
3. The method as in claim 1, wherein identifying the new traffic flow in the network comprises: receiving, at the device, a Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) message regarding the traffic flow.
4. The method as in claim 1, wherein determining the SLA associated with the new traffic flow comprises: obtaining traffic characteristics of the flow; and using a machine learning model on the traffic characteristics to predict the SLA associated with the traffic flow.
5. The method as in claim 1, wherein determining the SLA associated with the new traffic flow comprises: using a machine learning model to predict the SLA associated the traffic flow based on a history of traffic between endpoints of the traffic flow.
6. The method as in claim 1, further comprising: preempting another traffic flow on the particular tunnel with the new traffic flow, based on priorities associated with the flows.
7. The method as in claim 1, further comprising: computing a call admission control acceptance or failure rate for the particular tunnel; and using the computed acceptance or failure rate for service provider provisioning.
8. The method as in claim 1, wherein determining the SLA associated with the new traffic flow based in part on the calendar information associated with the user identifier comprises: retrieving the calendar information associated with the user identifier.
9. The method as in claim 1, wherein tunnels in the network are uncolored and eligible to carry any type of traffic.
10. An apparatus, comprising: one or more network interfaces to communicate with a network; a processor coupled to the network interfaces and configured to execute one or more processes; and a memory configured to store a process executable by the processor, the process when executed configured to: identify a new traffic flow in a network; identifying a user identifier associated with the new traffic flow; determine a service level agreement (SLA) associated with the new traffic flow based in part on calendar information associated with the user identifier; use a machine learning model to predict whether a particular tunnel in the network can satisfy the determined SLA of the traffic were the traffic flow routed onto the tunnel; and perform call admission control to route the new traffic flow onto the particular tunnel, based on a prediction that the tunnel can satisfy the determined SLA of the traffic.
11. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein the network is a software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN).
12. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein the apparatus identifies the new traffic flow in the network comprises: receiving, at the apparatus, a Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) message regarding the traffic flow.
13. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein the apparatus determines the SLA associated with the new traffic flow by: obtaining traffic characteristics of the flow; and using a machine learning model on the traffic characteristics to predict the SLA associated with the traffic flow.
14. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein the apparatus determines the SLA associated with the new traffic flow by: using a machine learning model to predict the SLA associated the traffic flow based on a history of traffic between endpoints of the traffic flow.
15. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein the process when executed is further configured to: preempt another traffic flow on the particular tunnel with the new traffic flow, based on priorities associated with the flows.
16. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein the process when executed is further configured to: computing a call admission control acceptance or failure rate for the particular tunnel; and using the computed acceptance or failure rate for service provider provisioning.
17. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein the apparatus determines the SLA associated with the new traffic flow based in part on the calendar information associated with the user identifier by: retrieving the calendar information associated with the user identifier.
18. The apparatus as in claim 10, wherein tunnels in the network are uncolored and eligible to carry any type of traffic.
19. A tangible, non-transitory, computer-readable medium storing program instructions that cause a device in a network to execute a process comprising: identifying, by the device, a new traffic flow in the network; identifying, by the device, a user identifier associated with the new traffic flow; determining, by the device, a service level agreement (SLA) associated with the new traffic flow based in part on calendar information associated with the user identifier; using, by the device, a machine learning model to predict whether a particular tunnel in the network can satisfy the determined SLA of the traffic were the traffic flow routed onto the tunnel; and performing, by the device, call admission control to route the new traffic flow onto the particular tunnel, based on a prediction that the tunnel can satisfy the determined SLA of the traffic.
20. The computer-readable medium as in claim 19, wherein the network is a software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN).
