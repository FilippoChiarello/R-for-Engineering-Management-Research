<title>
Ultrasound imaging system and method for displaying an acquisition quality level
</title>

<abstract>
A system and a method of ultrasound imaging includes acquiring ultrasound data, acquiring a quality parameter while acquiring the ultrasound data, determining an acquisition quality level based on the quality parameter, displaying an image generated based on the ultrasound data and displaying an ROI on the ultrasound image, where a color of the ROI represents the acquisition quality level.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method of ultrasound imaging comprising: acquiring ultrasound data; generating a first image in a first mode based on the ultrasound data; receiving a selection of an ROI with respect to the first image; generating a second image in a second mode based on the ultrasound data corresponding to the ROI; determining an acquisition quality level for the ultrasound data corresponding to the ROI; simultaneously displaying, on a display device, the first image, the second image, and a border to indicate a position of the ROI on the first image, wherein at least a portion of the border is colorized based on the acquisition quality level.
2. The method of ultrasound imaging of claim 1, where the ROI is an area and the border comprises an outline around the ROI.
3. The method of ultrasound imaging of claim 2, where the outline comprises a solid line.
4. The method of ultrasound imaging of claim 2, where the outline comprises a dashed line.
5. The method of ultrasound imaging of claim 1, where the ROI is an area and the border consists of a plurality of corner markers, where each corner marker comprises two straight lines disposed at an angle to each other, and where a point of intersection of the two straight lines of each corner marker is used to indicate a position of a corner of the ROI.
6. The method of ultrasound imaging of claim 1, where the ROI is a rectangle, and where the border consists of a first horizontal line positioned along a lower horizontal border of the ROI and a second horizontal line positioned along an upper horizontal border of the ROI.
7. The method of ultrasound imaging of claim 1, where the ROI is a rectangle, and where the border consists of a first vertical line positioned along a left vertical border of the ROI and a second vertical line positioned along an right vertical border of the ROI.
8. The method of ultrasound imaging of claim of claim 1, where the ROI comprises a one-dimensional region and the border consists of a line.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the first image is a B-mode image.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the ROI is a line.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the second image is an M-mode image.
12. The method of claim 9, wherein the ROI is an area.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the second image is a Doppler image.
14. An ultrasound imaging system comprising: a probe; a display device; and a processor in electronic communication with the probe and the display device, wherein the processor is configured to: control the probe to acquire ultrasound data; generate a first image in a first mode based on the ultrasound data; receive a selection of an ROI with respect to the first image; generate a second image in a second mode based on the ultrasound data corresponding to the ROI; determine an acquisition quality level for the ultrasound data corresponding to the ROI; simultaneously display, on the display device, the first image, the second image, and a border to indicate a position of the ROI on the first image, wherein at least a portion of the border is colorized based on the acquisition quality level.
15. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 14, wherein the ROI is an area and the border comprises an outline around the ROI.
16. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 15, where the border comprises a solid line.
17. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 15, where the border comprises a dashed line.
18. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 14, where the ROI comprises a rectangle, and where the border consists of a pair of horizontal lines that are spaced apart in a vertical direction.
19. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 14, where the ROI comprises a rectangle, and where the border comprises a pair of vertical lines that are spaced apart in a horizontal direction.
20. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 14, where the ROI is an area and the border comprises a plurality of corner markers, where each corner marker comprises two straight lines disposed at an angle to each other, and where a point of intersection of the two straight lines of each corner marker is used to indicate the position of a corner of the ROI.
21. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 14, where the ROI comprises a one-dimensional region and the border consists of a line.
22. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 14, wherein the first image is a B-mode image.
23. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 22, wherein the ROI is a line.
24. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 23, wherein the second image is an M-mode image.
25. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 22, wherein ROI is an area.
26. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 25, wherein the second image is a Doppler image.
27. A non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon, a computer program having at least one code section, said at least one code section being executable by a machine for causing said machine to perform one or more steps comprising: acquiring ultrasound data; generating a first image in a first mode based on the ultrasound data; receiving a selection of an ROI with respect to the first image; generating a second image in a second mode based on the ultrasound data corresponding to the ROI; determining an acquisition quality level for the ultrasound data corresponding to the ROI; simultaneously displaying, on a display device, the first image, the second image, and a border to indicate a position of the ROI on the first image, wherein at least a portion of the border is colorized based on the acquisition quality level.
