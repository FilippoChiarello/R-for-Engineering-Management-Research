</title>

<abstract>
To solve problems of frequent occurrence and great harm of membrane fouling during MBR wastewater treatment process, the invention proposes a membrane fouling intelligent early warning method to realize online and accurate early warning of membrane fouling. This early warning method achieves accurate prediction of water permeability by constructing soft-computing model based on recurrent fuzzy neural network. The intelligent early warning of membrane fouling is achieved by the comprehensive evaluation method, which solves the problem that membrane fouling is difficult to be early warning in the MBR wastewater treatment process, improves the pretreatment ability of membrane fouling, reduces the damage caused by membrane fouling, ensures the safe operation of MBR wastewater treatment process, and promotes efficient and stable operation of MBR wastewater treatment plant.
