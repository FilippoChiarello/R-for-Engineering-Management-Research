CONCEPT FOR DESIGNING AND USING AN UAV CONTROLLER MODEL FOR CONTROLLING AN UAV
</title>

<abstract>
Examples relate to a method for generating an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) controller model for controlling an UAV, a system including an UAV, a wind generator, a motion-tracking system and a control module, and to an UAV. The method for training the UAV controller model includes providing a wind generator control signal to a wind generator, to cause the wind generator to emit a wind current towards the UAV. The method includes operating the UAV using the UAV controller model. A flight of the UAV is influenced by the wind generated by the wind generator. The method includes monitoring the flight of the UAV using a motion-tracking system to determine motion-tracking data. The method includes training the UAV controller model using a machine-learning algorithm based on the motion-tracking data.
