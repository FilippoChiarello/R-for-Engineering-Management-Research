<title>
Methods and apparatus to profile geographic areas of interest
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and apparatus to generate data for geographic areas are disclosed. An example method includes identifying a first geographic area for which a database does not include a model, determining a first data element of the first geographic area, identifying a first trained model corresponding to a second geographic area with the first data element, identifying a second trained model corresponding to a third geographic area with the first data element, mixing the first trained model and the second trained model to generate a composite model, and using the composite model to represent the first geographic area in the database.
