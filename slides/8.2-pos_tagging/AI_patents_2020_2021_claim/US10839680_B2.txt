Vehicle control device, vehicle control method, and storage medium
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle control device (100) comprising: a recognizer (130) recognizing surrounding situations of a vehicle; a setting unit (154) setting a virtual lane in an area inside a crossing that is present in an advancement direction of the vehicle on the basis of a recognition result acquired by the recognizer; and a driving controller (150, 160) controlling one or both of steering and acceleration/deceleration of the vehicle and causing the vehicle to run within the virtual lane and pass through the crossing in a case in which an object recognized by the recognizer is not present on the virtual lane, wherein, in a case in which an area inside the crossing has a width for which only one virtual lane is settable, the driving controller handles an oncoming vehicle recognized by the recognizer as an object present on the virtual lane.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A vehicle control device comprising: a recognizer recognizing surrounding situations of a vehicle; a setting unit setting a virtual lane of a predetermined width in an area inside a railroad crossing that is present in an advancement direction of the vehicle on the basis of a recognition result acquired by the recognizer; and a driving controller controlling steering and acceleration/deceleration of the vehicle and causing the vehicle to run within the virtual lane and pass through the railroad crossing in a case in which an object recognized by the recognizer is not present on the virtual lane, wherein, in a case in which the area inside the railroad crossing has a width for which only one virtual lane is settable, the driving controller handles an oncoming vehicle recognized by the recognizer as an object present on the virtual lane regardless of whether the oncoming vehicle is actually present on the virtual lane or not.
2. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein, in a case in which a space corresponding to one vehicle is recognized by the recognizer as being present in an area after passing through the railroad crossing, the driving controller causes the vehicle to run inside of the virtual lane and pass through the railroad crossing.
3. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein, in a case in which an object entering an area inside the railroad crossing is recognized by the recognizer, the setting unit changes the virtual lane in range in a changeable range.
4. A vehicle control method executed by a recognizer, a setting unit, and a computer mounted in a vehicle, the vehicle control method comprising: recognizing surrounding situations of a vehicle using the recognizer; setting a virtual lane of a predetermined width in an area inside a railroad crossing that is present in an advancement direction of the vehicle on the basis of a recognition result acquired by the recognizer using the setting unit; controlling steering and acceleration/deceleration of the vehicle and causing the vehicle to run within the virtual lane and pass through the railroad crossing in a case in which an object recognized by the recognizer is not present on the virtual lane using the computer; and handling an oncoming vehicle recognized by the recognizer as an object present on the virtual lane regardless of whether the oncoming vehicle is actually present on the virtual lane or not using the computer in a case in which the area inside the railroad crossing has a width for which only one virtual lane is settable.
5. A computer-readable non-transitory storage medium having a program stored thereon, the program causing a computer to execute: recognizing surrounding situations of a vehicle; setting a virtual lane of a predetermined width in an area inside a railroad crossing that is present in an advancement direction of the vehicle on the basis of a result of the recognition; controlling steering and acceleration/deceleration of the vehicle; causing the vehicle to run within the virtual lane and pass through the railroad crossing in a case in which an object recognized in the process of the recognition is not present on the virtual lane; and handling an oncoming vehicle recognized in the process of the recognition as an object present on the virtual lane regardless of whether the oncoming vehicle is actually present on the virtual lane or not in a case in which the area inside the railroad crossing has a width for which only one virtual lane is settable.
