SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING AN IMAGE
</title>

<abstract>
A method of generating an image of a sample is provided. The method comprises providing a plurality of photon detectors, scanning the sample with an excitation beam over a predetermined time period, the detectors receiving photons emitted by the sample due to the excitation during the time period. A plurality of intensity images associated with each of the detectors are generated, each being proportional to the mean number of photons detected per unit time. A plurality of correlation images associated with each combination of two of the detectors are generated, each of the correlation images being proportional to the variance of the distribution of detected photons per unit time. The image of the sample is generated using joint sparse recovery from the plurality of intensity and correlation images, wherein the intensity and correlation images have common support.
