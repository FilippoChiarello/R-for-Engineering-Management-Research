POINT CLOUD CODING STANDARD CONFORMANCE DEFINITION IN COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS
</title>

<abstract>
A mechanism is described for facilitating defining of interoperability signaling and conformance points for the PCC standard in computing environments. A computing device of embodiments, as described herein, includes a decoder to decode a compressed bitstream of video data representing a point cloud, point cloud reconstructor circuitry to reconstruct a point cloud from the decoded patch video data, a syntax element parser to receive at least one syntax element representing interoperability signaling in the compressed bitstream to indicate the number of points in one or more pictures of the video data, and processing hardware to determine if the number of points in the one or more pictures of the compressed bitstream is within the conformance limits of the point cloud reconstructor circuitry.
</abstract>
