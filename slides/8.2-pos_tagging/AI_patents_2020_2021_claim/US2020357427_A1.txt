Voice Activity Detection Using A Soft Decision Mechanism
</title>

<abstract>
Voice activity detection (VAD) is an enabling technology for a variety of speech based applications. Herein disclosed is a robust VAD algorithm that is also language independent. Rather than classifying short segments of the audio as either "speech" or "silence", the VAD as disclosed herein employees a soft-decision mechanism. The VAD outputs a speech-presence probability, which is based on a variety of characteristics.
