COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR TREATMENT OF CANCER
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are methods and compositions for the treatment of a proliferative disorder characterized by increased expression of the FOXM1 gene. Exemplary disorders include adenocarcinoma, melanoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, colon carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma, pancreatic carcinoma, gastric cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, lung cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, a brain cancer. Kits and articles of manufacture comprising compositions for such treatment are also disclosed.

<claims>
1. A method of treating a proliferative disorder characterized by increased expression of the FOXM1 gene, comprising the step of administering a composition comprising or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein said proliferative disorder is selected from a RASopathy, a LAM disease, a fibrotic disorder, a chronic inflammatory disorder, or a cancer.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein said proliferative disorder is cancer selected from an adenocarcinoma, a melanoma, a rhabdomyosarcoma, a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a head and neck squamous carcinoma, a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a colon carcinoma, a basal cell carcinoma, an infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma, an anaplastic astrocytoma, a glioblastoma, a pancreatic carcinoma, a gastric cancer, an acute myeloid leukemia, a lung cancer, a liver cancer, a breast cancer, a prostate cancer, and a brain cancer.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein said proliferative disorder is selected from A549 lung adenocarcinoma and KPC-2 pancreatic carcinoma.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein said proliferative disorder or said cancer overexpresses FOXM1 and wherein said proliferative disorder or said cancer further contains a RAS mutation.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein said composition is administered in an amount sufficient to cause one or more of the following: a decrease in tumor growth, a decrease in tumor cell proliferation, increased tumor cell apoptosis, inhibition of metastatic dissemination of cancer, improvement in patient survival, reduced ability of tumor cells to form colonies, and reduced ability of tumor cells to migrate.
7. The composition of claim 1, wherein said composition is administered to said individual in an amount sufficient to inhibit FOXM1 expression in cells overexpressing FOXM1 in said individual following administration of said composition to said individual.
8. A method of reducing the amount of a chemotherapeutic agent administered to an individual in need thereof, comprising the step of administering a composition of claim 1 to said individual prior to, concurrently with, or following administration of said chemotherapeutic agent.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein said chemotherapeutic agent is selected from a taxane, a platinum-based agent, an anthracycline, an alkylating agent, a vinca alkaloid, an epothilone, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, a topoisomerase I and II inhibitor, a kinase inhibitor, a nucleotide analog, a precursor analog, a peptide antibiotic, and combinations thereof.
10. A composition comprising RCM-1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and one or more chemotherapeutic agents selected from a taxane, a platinum-based agent, an anthracycline, an alkylating agent, a vinca alkaloid, an epothilone, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, a topoisomerase I and II inhibitor, a kinase inhibitor, a nucleotide analog, a precursor analog, a peptide antibiotic, and combinations thereof.
11. A kit comprising a composition according to claim 1 and a means for delivery of the composition to a human.
12. An article of manufacture comprising: a. a container comprising a label; and b. a composition according to claim 1, wherein said label indicates that the composition is to be administered to a human having, suspected of having, or at risk for developing a proliferative disorder.
13. The article of claim 12, wherein said proliferative disorder is cancer.
14. The article of claim 13 wherein said cancer has increased expression of FOXM1.
15. The article of claim 12, further comprising one or more chemotherapeutic agents selected from a taxane, a platinum-based agent, an anthracycline, an alkylating agent, a vinca alkaloid, an epothilone, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, a topoisomerase I and II inhibitor, a kinase inhibitor, a nucleotide analog, a precursor analog, a peptide antibiotic, and combinations thereof.
