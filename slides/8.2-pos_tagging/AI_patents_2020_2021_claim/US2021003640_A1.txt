FAULT LOCATING METHOD AND SYSTEM BASED ON MULTI-LAYER EVALUATION MODEL
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosure discloses a fault locating method based on a multi-layer evaluation model. Firstly, determine a fault type to be inspected and a fault symptom which able to accurately and effectively reflect a power transformer operation status and determine a weight of each fault type by using an association rule and a set pair analysis. Then, establish a DBN model to perform feature extraction and classification on multi-dimensional data of a fault. Finally, perform a comprehensive evaluation on an existing diagnosis result by using the D-S evidence theory. Accordingly, the supporting strength of the common target is reinforced, while the influence of divergent targets is reduced. As a result, the uncertainty in the diagnosis result is significantly reduced. The disclosure is mainly used to monitor and diagnose a status variable of the power transformer in a real-time manner, and treats power transformer status evaluation as a multi-property decision issue.
