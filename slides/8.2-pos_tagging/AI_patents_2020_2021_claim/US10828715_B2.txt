System for welding
</title>

<abstract>
A welding system includes a welding station having a weld station computer and a weld system in communication with the weld station computer. The weld system includes a supply of weld material, a welding device, and a weld supply motor assembly that moves the weld material to the welder device. The system further includes a weighting device operatively connected with the weld station computer to measure a weight of the supply of weld material and to communicate the weight of the supply of weld material to the weld station computer; and a sensor operatively connected with the weld supply motor assembly and the weld station computer so as to communicate the speed of the weld supply motor assembly to the weld station computer. The weld station computer is operatively connected to the weld supply motor assembly to control the speed of the motor assembly based on the weight data.

<claims>
1. A welding system, comprising: a plurality of welding stations, each welding station including a weld station computer and weld system in communication with the weld station computer, each welding station including one or more sensors, the one or more sensors configured to measure weld data, wherein the weld data includes data related to one or more operating parameters of the weld system that are configured to control an ongoing weld operation of the weld system; a plurality of wireless devices in communication with the one or more of the welding station computers to receive the weld data; and a cloud server in communication with the wireless devices, the cloud server being configured to process the weld data, wherein the cloud server is configured to communicate the processed weld data to one or more of the wireless devices, wherein, if the weld data is outside a threshold, the weld station computer is configured to instruct the weld system to modify the ongoing weld operation of the weld system.
2. The welding system according to claim 1, wherein the weld data comprises voltage data, current data, speed data, or any proper combination thereof.
3. The welding system according to claim 2, wherein the voltage data includes a lead voltage applied to a weld wire.
4. The welding system according to claim 2, the current data includes a lead current applied to a weld wire.
5. The welding system according to claim 2, wherein, if the current data in the weld system is high, the weld station computer instructs the weld system to slow down a speed of the weld system or controls a position of a torch in the weld system.
6. The welding system according to claim 2, wherein the speed data includes a lead wire speed of a weld wire.
7. The welding system of claim 1, wherein the cloud server is configured to process the weld data in real-time.
8. The welding system according to claim 1, wherein the welding system is configured to provide real-time quality control of the weld operation of the weld system based on the weld data.
9. The welding system according to claim 1, wherein the welding system is configured to provide real-time monitoring the weld operation of the weld system.
10. The welding system according to claim 1, wherein the welding system is configured to process the weld data from one or more of the plurality of welding stations simultaneously.
