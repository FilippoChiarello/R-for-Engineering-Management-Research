SYSTEMS AND METHODS TO FACILITATE REVIEW OF LIVER TUMOR CASES
</title>

<abstract>
Apparatus (100, 500), systems, and methods (300) to process an interior region of interest in an anatomy image via a user interface are disclosed. An example apparatus is to at least: process an image to reduce noise in the image (310); identify at least one of an organ of interest or a region of interest in the image (320); analyze values in at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest (330); process the at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest based on the analyzed values to provide a processed object in the at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest (340, 350); and display the processed object for interaction via an interface, the display to include exposing at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest (360).

<claims>
1. An apparatus (100, 500) comprising: at least one processor (512); and at least one computer readable storage medium (513, 514, 516, 528) including instructions which, when executed, cause the at least one processor (512) to at least: process an image to reduce noise in the image (310); identify at least one of an organ of interest or a region of interest in the image (320); analyze values in at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest (330, 340); process the at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest based on the analyzed values to provide a processed object in the at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest (350); and display the processed object for interaction via an interface, the display to include exposing at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest (360).
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the object in the exposed region of interest is to be processed using a look up table of display values associated with image data values.
3. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the display values are to be determined using Displayed Value = K(HUValue - mean + O)/(K.STD), wherein K and O are prior values from previous display sessions, HUValue is a Hounsfield unit value, mean is a mean of prior values K and O, and K.STD is standard deviation in prior K value.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the object in the exposed region of interest is to be processed using a linear ramp function converting image data values to display values.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the image is to be processed to reduce noise in the image using adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is to expose the region of interest by at least: removing voxels from the image outside a soft tissue range to produce a modified image (410); applying a morphology closure filter to the modified image (420); selecting a largest connected component in the modified image (430); selecting a first slice in the largest connecting component having a largest number of pixels in the largest connected component (440); selecting a plurality of second slices within a thickness of the first slice to form an object (450); eroding the object to select internal voxels inside the object to expose the region of interest (460); computing deviation in the region of interest (470; and applying a look up table to display values of the region of interest (480).
7. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the organ is a liver and wherein the object is a liver tumor.
8. A computer-implemented method (300) comprising: processing, by executing an instruction using at least one processor, an image to reduce noise in the image (310); identifying, by executing an instruction using the at least one processor, at least one of an organ of interest or a region of interest in the image (320); analyzing, by executing an instruction using the at least one processor, values in at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest (330, 340); processing, by executing an instruction using the at least one processor, the at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest based on the analyzed values to provide a processed object in the at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest (350); and displaying, by executing an instruction using the at least one processor, the processed object for interaction via an interface, the display to include exposing at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest (360).
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the object in the exposed region of interest is to be processed using a look up table of display values associated with image data values.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the display values are to be determined using Displayed Value = K(HUValue - mean + O)/(K.STD), wherein K and O are prior values from previous display sessions, HUValue is a Hounsfield unit value, mean is a mean of prior values K and O, and K.STD is standard deviation in prior K value.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein the object in the exposed region of interest is to be processed using a linear ramp function converting image data values to display values.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the image is to be processed to reduce noise in the image using adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction.
13. The method of claim 8, wherein exposing the region of interest further includes: removing voxels from the image outside a soft tissue range to produce a modified image (410); applying a morphology closure filter to the modified image (420); selecting a largest connected component in the modified image (430); selecting a first slice in the largest connecting component having a largest number of pixels in the largest connected component (440); selecting a plurality of second slices within a thickness of the first slice to form an object (450); eroding the object to select internal voxels inside the object to expose the region of interest (460); computing deviation in the region of interest (470); and applying a look up table to display values of the region of interest (480).
14. At least one computer readable storage medium including instructions which, when executed, cause at least one processor to at least: process an image to reduce noise in the image (310); identify at least one of an organ of interest or a region of interest in the image (320); analyze values in at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest (330, 340); process the at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest based on the analyzed values to provide a processed object in the at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest (350); and display the processed object for interaction via an interface, the display to include exposing at least one of the organ of interest or the region of interest (360).
15. The at least one computer readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein the instructions, when executed, cause the at least one processor is to expose the region of interest by at least: removing voxels from the image outside a soft tissue range to produce a modified image (410); applying a morphology closure filter to the modified image (420); selecting a largest connected component in the modified image (430); selecting a first slice in the largest connecting component having a largest number of pixels in the largest connected component (440); selecting a plurality of second slices within a thickness of the first slice to form an object (450); eroding the object to select internal voxels inside the object to expose the region of interest (460); computing deviation in the region of interest (470); and applying a look up table to display values of the region of interest (480).
