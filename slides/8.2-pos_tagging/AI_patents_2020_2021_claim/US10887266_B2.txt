<title>
Personalization of delivery of notifications
</title>

<abstract>
Particular embodiments described herein provide for system that can be configured to deliver a notification to a user based on the user's preference for each device that receives the notification. The user's preference is based on how the user interacted with similar notifications in the past and the system can change how it will deliver similar notifications to the user in the future based on how the user interacts with the notification.

<claims>
1. At least one non-transitory machine readable medium comprising one or more instructions that when executed by at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to: intercept a notification for a user sent from a notification server; assign a relevance to the notification, wherein the relevance is based at least in part on how the user interacted with similar notifications in the past, on a stored user's preference, and on one or more of: a reputation of the application sending the notification, a relationship between a sender and the user, and semantics of the notification content; determine a device to which the notification will be communicated based at least in part on a type of the notification and the relevance assigned to the notification; determine a delivery mechanism for the notification, wherein the delivery mechanism is based on the determined device and the stored user's preference; communicate the notification to the determined device according to the determined delivery mechanism; determine how the user interacted with the notification; and update the stored user's preference based on how the user interacted with the notification.
2. The at least one machine readable medium of claim 1, further comprising one or more instructions that when executed by at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to: determine a second device to which the notification will be communicated; determine a second delivery mechanism for the notification, wherein the second delivery mechanism is based on the determined second device and the stored user's preference, wherein the second delivery mechanism is different than the delivery mechanism; and communicate the notification to the determined second device according to the determined second delivery mechanism.
3. The at least one machine readable medium of claim 2, wherein the delivery mechanism for the notification is a graphic to be displayed on the device and the second delivery mechanism for the notification is an audible sound to be played on the second device.
4. An apparatus comprising: a hardware-based processor; and a notification engine, executable by the hardware-based processor, wherein the notification engine is configured to: intercept a notification for a user sent from a notification server; assign a relevance to the notification, wherein the relevance is based at least in part on how the user interacted with similar notifications in the past, on a stored user's preference, and on one or more of: a reputation of the application sending the notification, a relationship between a sender and the user, and semantics of the notification content; determine a device to which the notification will be communicated based at least in part on a type of the notification and the relevance assigned to the notification; determine a delivery mechanism for the notification, wherein the delivery mechanism is based on the determined device and the stored user's preference; communicate the notification to the determined device according to the determined delivery mechanism; determine how the user interacted with the notification; and update the stored user's preference based at least in part on how the user interacted with the notification.
5. The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the notification engine is further configured to: determine a second device to which the notification will be communicated; determine a second delivery mechanism for the notification, wherein the second delivery mechanism is based on the determined second device and the stored user's preference, wherein the second delivery mechanism is different than the delivery mechanism; and communicate the notification to the determined second device according to the determined second delivery mechanism.
6. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein the delivery mechanism for the notification is a graphic to be displayed on the device and the second delivery mechanism for the notification is an audible sound to be played on the second device.
7. A method comprising: intercepting a notification for a user sent from a notification server; assigning a relevance to the notification, wherein the relevance is based at least in part on how the user interacted with similar notifications in the past, on a stored user's preference, and on one or more of: a reputation of the application sending the notification, a relationship between a sender and the user, and semantics of the notification content; determining a device to which the notification will be communicated based at least in part on a type of the notification and the relevance assigned to the notification; determining a delivery mechanism for the notification, wherein the delivery mechanism is based on the determined device and the stored user's preference; communicating the notification of the determined device according to the determined delivery mechanism; determining how the user interacted with the notification; and updating the stored user's preference based on how the user interacted with the notification.
8. The method of claim 6, further comprising: determining a second device to which notification will be communicated; determining a second delivery mechanism for the notification, wherein the second delivery mechanism is based on the determined second device and the stored user's preference, wherein the second delivery mechanism is different than the delivery mechanism; and communicating the notification to the determined second device according to the determined second delivery mechanism.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the delivery mechanism for the notification is a graphic to be displayed on the device and the second delivery mechanism for the notification is an audible sound to be played on the second device.
10. A system for personalization of delivery of notifications, the system comprising: a hardware-based processor; and a notification engine, executable by the hardware-based processor, wherein the notification engine is configured to: intercept a notification for a user sent from a notification server; assign a relevance to the notification, wherein the relevance is based at least in part on how the user interacted with similar notifications in the past, on a stored user's preference, and on one or more of: a reputation of the application sending the notification, a relationship between a sender and the user, and semantics of the notification content; determine a device to which the notification will be communicated based at least in part on a type of the notification and the relevance assigned to the notification; determine a delivery mechanism for the notification, wherein the delivery mechanism is based on the determined device and the stored user's preference; communicate the notification to the determined device according to the determined delivery mechanism; determine how the user interacted with the notification; and update the stored user's preference based on how the user interacted with the notification.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the authentication engine is further configured to: determine a second device to which notification will be communicated; determine a second delivery mechanism for the notification, wherein the second delivery mechanism is based on the determined second device and the stored user's preference, wherein the second delivery mechanism is different than the delivery mechanism; and communicate the notification to the determined second device according to the determined second delivery mechanism.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the delivery mechanism for the notification is a graphic to be displayed on the device and the second delivery mechanism for the notification is an audible sound to be played on the second device.
