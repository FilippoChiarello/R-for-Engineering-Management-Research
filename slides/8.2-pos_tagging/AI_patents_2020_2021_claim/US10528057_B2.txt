<title>
Systems and methods for radar localization in autonomous vehicles
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and method are provided for controlling a vehicle. In one embodiment, a localization method includes receiving sensor data relating to an environment of a vehicle, the sensor data including a plurality of sensor returns associated with objects in the environment, each of the sensor returns having a plurality of corresponding attributes, and constructing a first plurality of sensor data groups, each including a self-consistent subset of the plurality of sensor returns based on their corresponding attributes. The method further includes defining, for each of the first plurality of sensor data groups, a first set of features, wherein each feature is based on at least one of the corresponding attributes and each has an associated feature location, and determining, with a processor, a feature correlation between the first set of features and a second, previously determined set of features.

A localization method comprising: receiving sensor data relating to an environment of a vehicle, the sensor data including a plurality of sensor returns associated with objects in the environment, each of the sensor returns having a plurality of corresponding attributes; constructing a first plurality of sensor data groups, each including a self-consistent subset of the plurality of sensor returns based on a machine learning clustering method and their corresponding attributes; defining, for each of the first plurality of sensor data groups, a first set of features, wherein the first set of features includes a histogram associated with each of the corresponding attributes, and wherein each group has an associated feature location; determining, with a processor, a feature correlation between the first set of features and a second, previously determined set of features based on the histograms and the feature location; and estimating a position of the vehicle based on the feature correlation.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of corresponding attributes includes at least one of Doppler shift, return power, and neighborhood similarity.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the sensor data includes at least radar data.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the first set of features includes a convex hull of the histogram.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the first set of features includes a summary statistic of one of the corresponding attributes.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the feature correlation includes performing an outlier removal procedure with respect to the first and second sets of features.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the outlier removal procedure is a random sample consensus (RANSAC) procedure.
8. The method of claim 1, further including classifying each of the sensor data groups as being associated with one of a dynamic object, a static-moveable object, and a static-nonmoveable object, and determining the feature correlation based only on the sensor data groups associated with static-nonmoveable objects.
9. A system for controlling a vehicle, comprising: a feature determination module, including a processor, configured to: receive sensor data relating to an environment of a vehicle, the sensor data including a plurality of sensor returns associated with objects in the environment, each of the sensor returns having a plurality of corresponding attributes; construct a first plurality of sensor data groups, each including a self-consistent subset of the plurality of sensor returns based on a machine learning clustering method and their corresponding attributes; and define, for each of the first plurality of sensor data groups, a first set of features, the first set of features includes a histogram associated with each of the corresponding attributes, and wherein each group has an associated feature location; and a feature correlation module configured to determine, with a processor, a feature correlation between the first set of features and a second, previously determined set of features based on the histograms and the feature location.
