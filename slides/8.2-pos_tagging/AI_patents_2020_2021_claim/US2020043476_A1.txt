<title>
ELECTRONIC DEVICE, CONTROL METHOD THEREFOR, AND NON-TRANSITORY COMPUTER READABLE RECORDING MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosure relates to an artificial intelligence (AI) system utilizing a machine learning algorithm such as deep learning, and applications thereof. In particular, a method for controlling an electronic device of the disclosure includes the steps of: receiving a user's voice; acquiring text data from the user's voice; determining a goal component and a parameter component from the acquired text data; determining, on the basis of the goal component and the parameter component, a task corresponding to the user's voice; if it is determined that the determined task is not executable, determining an alternative task to replace the task that was determined on the basis of at least one of the goal component and the parameter component; and providing a message for guiding the alternative task.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A control method of an electronic device, the method comprising: receiving an input of a user's voice; acquiring text data from the user's voice and determining a goal component and a parameter component from the acquired text data; based on a basis of the goal component and the parameter component, determining a task corresponding to the user's voice; based on a determination that the determined task is not executable, determining the alternative task to replace the determined task on a basis of at least one of the goal component and the parameter component; and providing a message for guiding the alternative task.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the determining a task corresponding to the user's voice comprises determining a type of a task corresponding to the user's voice based on a basis of the determined goal component, and determining a content of a task corresponding to the user's voice on a basis of the parameter component.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: based on the type of the task being determined on a basis of the goal component, determining whether a content of the determined task is executable on a basis of the parameter component.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the determining the alternative task comprises, based on a determination that the content of the determined task is not executable, determining one of a plurality of alternative tasks which are capable of replacing the determined task as an alternative task, on a basis of the content of the determined task.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the determined task and the plurality of alternative tasks are matched to each other and prestored.
6. The method of claim 3, wherein the determining the alternative task comprises, based on a determination that the content of the determined task is not executable, determining an alternative task by inputting the content of the determined task to a learned alternative task determination model.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein a message for guiding the alternative task is processed in a natural language format.
8. An electronic device, comprising: an inputter configured to receive an input of a user's voice; and a processor configured to: acquire text data from the user's voice and determining a goal component and a parameter component from the acquired text data, based on a basis of the goal component and the parameter component, determine a task corresponding to the user's voice, based on a determination that the determined task is not executable, determine the alternative task to replace the determined task on a basis of at least one of the goal component and the parameter component, and provide a message for guiding the alternative task.
9. The electronic device of claim 1, wherein the processor determines a type of a task corresponding to the user's voice based on a basis of the determined goal component, and determines a content of a task corresponding to the user's voice on a basis of the parameter component.
10. The electronic device of claim 9, wherein the processor, based on the type of the task being determined on a basis of the goal component, determines whether a content of the determined task is executable on a basis of the parameter component.
11. The electronic device of claim 10, wherein the processor, based on a determination that the content of the determined task is not executable, determines one of a plurality of alternative tasks which are capable of replacing the determined task as an alternative task, on a basis of the content of the determined task.
12. The electronic device of claim 11, further comprising: a memory which matches and stores the determined task and the plurality of alternative tasks.
13. The electronic device of claim 10, wherein the processor, based on a determination that the content of the determined task is not executable, determines an alternative task by inputting the content of the determined task to a learned alternative task determination model.
14. The electronic device of claim 8, wherein the processor processes and provides a message for guiding the alternative task in a natural language format.
15. A non-transitory computer readable medium storing a computer program to execute a control method for an electronic device, wherein the control method for the electronic device comprises: receiving an input of a user's voice; acquiring text data from the user's voice and determining a goal component and a parameter component from the acquired text data; based on a basis of the goal component and the parameter component, determining a task corresponding to the user's voice; based on a determination that the determined task is not executable, determining the alternative task to replace the determined task on a basis of at least one of the goal component and the parameter component; and providing a message for guiding the alternative task.
