SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DOOR ERROR DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
The present inventive concept relates to a system and a method for monitoring an operation of a door of a public transportation vehicle. The system comprises at least one optical sensor unit arranged at a distance from the door, and the at least one optical sensor unit is configured to record a movement of the door during opening and/or closing of the door. The system also comprises a control unit, wherein said control unit is arranged to be connected to the at least one optical sensor unit, and is configured to determine a position of at least one reference point of the door based on the recorded movement of the door, determine a parameter of the movement of the door during opening and/or closing based on the determined position of the at least one reference point, determine a deviation of the parameter of the movement from a predetermined/allowed range of values of the parameter and determine an error in the operation of the door based on the determined deviation.

<claims>
1. A system for monitoring an operation of a door of a public transportation vehicle, the system comprising: at least one video camera arranged at a distance from the door, the at least one video camera being configured to record a movement of said door during opening and/or closing of the door; a controller arranged to receive video data from the video camera, and further being configured to: determine a position of at least one reference point of said door in said video data; determine a parameter, as a function over time, of the movement of said door during opening and/or closing from said video data, and based on the determined position of the at least one reference point; determine from the determined parameter whether the movement of the door is normal or anomalous.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein, the video camera is a surveillance camera connected to a surveillance system of the public transportation vehicle.
3. The system of claim 1 or 2, wherein the video camera is a closed-circuit television, CCTV, camera.
4. The system of any one of the preceding claims, wherein, the reference point of the door is at least one of a mark and a recognizable geometrical feature.
5. The system of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the reference point is determined with Canny edge detection.
6. The system of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the step of determining whether the movement is normal or anomalous comprises determining whether the determined parameter fall within a predetermined allowed range of values for said parameter.
7. The system of any one of the preceding claims, wherein said parameter is a position function of reference point as a function over time.
8. The system of any one of the claims 1-7, wherein said parameter is a velocity of said reference point as function over time.
9. The system of any one of the claims 1-7, wherein said parameter is an acceleration of said reference point as a function over time.
10. The system of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the determination of whether the movement is normal or anomalous comprises determining whether the determined parameter deviates from stored previously recorded data for the same parameter and related to the same door.
11. The system of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the determination of whether the movement is normal or anomalous comprises determining whether the parameter, as a function over time, deviates from normal operation of such doors, based on artificial intelligence with access to a database of recordings of the same parameter, as a function over time, for a plurality of previously recorded doors.
12. The system of any one of the preceding claims, wherein said controller is configured to generate an alarm signal upon determination that the movement of the door is anomalous.
13. The system of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the controller is at least partly arranged in a control unit on-board said public transportation vehicle.
14. The system of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the controller is at least partly arranged in a central control unit, arranged externally from said public transportation vehicle, and wherein the vehicle further comprises a communication unit, configured to wirelessly communicate with said central control unit.
15. The system according to any of preceding claims, wherein, said control unit is configured to determine a time window during which a door movement is expected, and to determine that the movement of the door is anomalous in door movement is not initiated during this time window.
16. A method for monitoring an operation of a door of a public transportation vehicle, the method comprising: recording video data of a movement of said door during opening and/or closing of said door; determine a position of at least one reference point of said door in said video data; determine a parameter, as a function over time, of the movement of said door during opening and/or closing from said video data, and based on the determined position of the at least one reference point; determine from the determined parameter whether the movement of the door is normal or anomalous.
