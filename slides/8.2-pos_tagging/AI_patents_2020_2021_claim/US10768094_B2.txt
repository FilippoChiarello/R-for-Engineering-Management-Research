<title>
Thermography image processing with neural networks to identify corrosion under insulation (CUI)
</title>

<abstract>
A method for identifying corrosion under insulation (CUI) in a structure comprises receiving thermographs from the structure using an infrared camera, applying filters to the thermograph using a first machine learning system, initially determining a CUI classification based on output from the filters, and validating the initial CUI classification by an inspection of the structure. The first machine learning system is trained using results of the validation. Outputs of the first machine learning system and additional structural and environmental data are fed into a second machine learning system that incorporates information from earlier states into current states. The second machine learning system is trained to identify CUI according to changes in the outputs of the first machine learning system and the additional data over time until a second threshold for CUI classification accuracy is reached. CUI is thereafter identified using the first and second machine learning systems in coordination.
