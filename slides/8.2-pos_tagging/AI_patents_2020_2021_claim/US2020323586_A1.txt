METHODS, APPARATUSES, AND SYSTEMS FOR THE TREATMENT OF PULMONARY DISORDERS
</title>

<abstract>
Apparatuses, systems and methods are provided for treating pulmonary tissues via delivery of energy, generally characterized by high voltage pulses, to target tissue using a pulmonary tissue modification system (e.g., an energy delivery catheter system). Example pulmonary tissues include, without limitation, the epithelium (the goblet cells, ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells, and basal cells), lamina propria, submucosa, submucosal glands, basement membrane, smooth muscle, cartilage, nerves, pathogens resident near or within the tissue, or a combination of any of these. The system may be used to treat a variety of pulmonary diseases or disorders such as or associated with COPD (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema), asthma, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), acute bronchitis and/or other pulmonary diseases or disorders.

<claims>
1. A system for treating mucus hypersecretion of a diseased portion of wall of a lung passageway of a patient comprising: a catheter comprising at least one electrode, wherein the at least one electrode is configured to be positioned within a lumen of the lung passageway so that the at least one electrode is able to transmit energy to the diseased portion of the wall of the lung passageway; and a generator in electrical communication with the at least one electrode, wherein the generator includes at least one energy delivery algorithm configured to provide an electric signal to the at least one electrode so that energy is transmitted to the diseased portion of the wall in a manner that induces reverse remodeling of the diseased portion of the wall so as to reduce mucus hypersecretion.
2. A system as in claim 1, wherein induces reverse remodeling comprises induces the removal of cells or death of cells within the diseased portion of the wall while maintaining a collagen matrix within the diseased portion of the wall configured to allow cellular infiltration for reverse remodeling.
3. A system as in claim 2, wherein the cells comprise cells associated with mucus hypersecretion.
4. A system as in claim 2, wherein the cells comprise endothelial cells or submucosal cells.
5. A system as in claim 2, wherein the cells include any cells up to but not including a cartilage layer in the diseased portion of the wall.
6. A system as in claim 1, wherein induces reverse remodeling comprises induces the modification of cells of the diseased portion of the wall.
7. A system as in claim 6, wherein the modification of cells alters mucus production by the cells.
8. A system as in claim 6, wherein the modification of cells reprograms the cells or conditions the cells for improved agent uptake.
9. A system as in claim 1, wherein the energy is transmitted to the diseased portion of the wall to a targeted cell depth set to avoid a cartilage layer.
10. A system as in claim 9, wherein the targeted cell depth is set to affect an epithelial layer without extending beyond a basement membrane.
11. A system as in claim 1, wherein the electric signal has a waveform comprising at least one energy packet, wherein each energy packet comprises a series of pulses.
12. A system as in claim 11, wherein each packet has a cycle count of up to 2,000 biphasic pulses.
13. A system as in claim 11, wherein each energy packet has a duration of up to 100 microseconds.
14. A system as in claim 11, wherein the at least one energy packet comprises five distinct energy packets and wherein each of the five distinct energy packets has a cycle count in the range of 1-100 cycles per packet.
15. A system as in claim 1, further comprising a return electrode wherein at least one electrode functions as a single electrode in a monopolar fashion with the return electrode disposed outside of the patient.
16. A system as in claim 15, wherein the electric signal has a waveform comprising at least one energy packet, wherein each energy packet comprises a series of pulses having a voltage between approximately 2000-3500 volts.
17. A system as in claim 1, wherein the at least one electrode comprises at least one bipolar electrode pair and wherein the generator is in electrical communication with the at least one bipolar electrode pair so as to provide the electric signal to the at least one bipolar electrode pair causing the energy to be transmitted to the diseased portion of the wall of the lung passageway in a bipolar fashion.
18. A system as in claim 17, wherein the electric signal has a waveform comprising at least one energy packet, wherein each energy packet comprises a series of pulses having a voltage between approximately 100-1900 volts.
19. A system as in claim 1, wherein at least one of the at least one electrode comprises a plurality of wires forming an expandable basket configured to expand within the lung passageway.
20. A system as in claim 1, wherein at least one of the at least one electrode comprises an energy delivery body having a plurality of separate active areas which are each insulated from each other.
21. A system as in claim 1, wherein the at least one of the at least one electrode comprises an energy delivery body having an active area isolated from a remainder of the energy delivery body.
22. A system as in claim 1, wherein the generator comprises a processor in communication with at least one sensor, wherein the processor modifies at least one of the at least one energy delivery algorithm based on data from the at least one sensor.
