SYSTEMS AND METHODS OF SECURITY FOR TRUSTED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HARDWARE PROCESSING
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the present disclosure are presented for an AI system featuring specially designed AI hardware that incorporates security features to provide iron clad trust and security to run AI applications/solution models. Presented herein are various security features for AI processing, including: a trust and integrity verifier of data during operation of an AI solution model; identity and trust establishment between an entity and the AI solution model; secure isolation for a virtual AI multilane system; a real-time attack detection and prevention mechanism; and built in detection mechanisms related to rogue security attack elements insertion during manufacturing. Aspects also include security to implement an AI network interconnecting multiple user devices in an AI environment.

<claims>
1. An artificial intelligence (AI) architecture configured to provide a trusted and secured environment for running AI applications/solutions models, the AI architecture comprising: a trust and integrity module configured to verify AI application/solution model data and parameters and related state machine parameters before and during running (training or performing inference) an AI solution model; an identity and trust module to establish identity and trust between an entity and the AI application/solution model configured to ensure that the rightful stake holder is running the AI application/solution model; a built-in module incorporated into the AI architecture configured to provide trust and security to run the AI applications/solution models; and at least one real-time attack detection and prevention module built into an AI architecture lane.
2. The AI architecture of claim 1, wherein the trust and integrity module is embedded in a state machine engine of the AI architecture hardware.
3. The AI architecture of claim 2, wherein the state machine engine engages a security processing logic unit (S-PLU) hashing instance and then hashes the model by chunks or hashes of the entire AI solution model.
4. The AI architecture of claim 3, wherein the state machine engine verifies the generated hashes with hashes provided by a user and determines that the integrity of the model is not compromised based on a match between both hashes.
5. The AI architecture of claim 3, wherein the state machine comprises a security component within a compute block of the AI architecture in conjunction with the S-PLU configured to enforce security.
6. The AI architecture of claim 5, wherein the security component of the state machine belonging to the compute block/engine is configured to: retrieve security parameters taken such as a decryption key or digest value; compose the S-PLU to process hashing; execute by invoking an S-PLU hash instance with digest value and necessary model data and ascertain the integrity of the AI solution model if the result matches; and invoke a decryption with the decryption key, if the AI solution model encryption is enabled.
7. The AI architecture of claim 1, further comprising: an isolation module configured to provide secure isolation between lanes of a virtual AI architecture multilane and to prevent leakage and theft.
8. The AI architecture of claim 1, further comprising: a built in detection mechanism configured to detect related rogue security attack elements inserted during a manufacturing process of AI architecture hardware.
9. The AI architecture of claim 1, further comprising: an interconnection mechanism configured to communicatively connect to one or more other AI solution models in a coordinated and secure fashion.
10. The AI architecture of claim 9, wherein the interconnection mechanism comprises block chain technology.
11. A trusted artificial intelligence (AI) architecture model network, wherein the network is configured to: ascertain identity of a member belonging to a trusted AI network model membership through credentials; verify that the model belongs to the trusted AI solution model network; allow storage and retrieval of AI solution models to/from the AI solution model network in a distributed fashion; provide provision to monitor and detect bad member for accountability having trusted arbitration authority; and acquire credentials from a trusted network and enforce AI applications/solutions with a hardware security enabled state machine in conjunction with a security processing logic unit (S-PLU) in cloud and edge environments while running a model for a given user member.
12. The trusted AI architecture model network of claim 11, comprising: a trust and integrity module configured to verify that the model belongs to the trusted AI solution model network; an identity and trust module to establish identity and trust between an entity and the AI application/solution model configured to ensure that the rightful stake holder is running the AI application/solution model; a built-in module incorporated into the AI architecture configured to provide trust and security to run the AI applications/solution models; and at least one real-time attack detection and prevention module built into an AI architecture lane.
13. The trusted AI architecture model network of claim 12, wherein the trust and integrity module, the identity and trust module, built-in module incorporated into the AI architecture, and the at least one real-time attack detection and prevention module are each embedded in hardware and configured to operate without a software operating system.
14. The trusted AI architecture model network of claim 11, wherein the trust and integrity module is embedded in a hardware based state machine engine.
15. The trusted AI architecture model network of claim 14, wherein the state machine engine engages a security processing logic unit (S-PLU) hashing instance and then hashes the model by chunks or hashes of the entire AI solution model.
16. The trusted AI architecture model network of claim 15, wherein the state machine engine verifies the generated hashes with hashes provided by a user and determines that the integrity of the model is not compromised based on a match between both hashes.
