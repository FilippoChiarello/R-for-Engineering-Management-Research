<title>
Apparatus and method for DC-component-based fault classification of three-phase distribution power cables with magnetic sensing
</title>

<abstract>
A DC-component-based fault classification apparatus and method for a three-phase power distribution cable utilizes the reconstructed three-phase currents by measuring the magnetic field around the cable with an array of magnetic sensors arranged around the cable surface. A magnetic shield houses the magnetic sensors and blocks background magnetic fields. A data acquisition system acquires analog signals from the sensors and a processing system extracts DC components in the analog signals for the phases during the transient period after a fault. The potential DC components are extracted by mathematical morphology. These DC components arise in the faulted phases when a fault occurs since there is a large current change in the inductive power network.
