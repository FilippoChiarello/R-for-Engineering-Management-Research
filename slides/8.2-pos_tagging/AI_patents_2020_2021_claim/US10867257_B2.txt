Automatic online activity abuse report accuracy prediction method and apparatus
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are systems and methods for improving interactions with and between computers in content generating, searching, hosting and/or providing systems supported by or configured with personal computing devices, servers and/or platforms. The systems interact to identify and retrieve data within or across platforms, which can be used to improve the quality of data used in processing interactions between or among processors in such systems. The disclosed systems and methods provide systems and methods for automatically predicting the accuracy of an abuse report and determining, in accordance with the automatically-determined accuracy of the abuse report, an appropriate action(s) to be taken in response to the abuse report.

12. The method of claim 1, the n-dimensional feature vector comprising raw count features, beta distribution parameter features for a number of probabilities, beta distribution mean and variance features for the number of probabilities, logarithmic raw count features, binned raw count features, binned beta parameter features, and cross-product features.
13. The method of claim 12, the number of probabilities comprising a probability that a post is reported, a probability that a post by the posting user is reported, a probability that a post by the posting user that is reported is confirmed as accurate, a probability that a post is reported by the reporting user, a probability that any abuse report by the reporting user is confirmed as accurate, a probability that any post by the posting user is reported by the reporting user, and a probability that any post by the posting user is reported by the reporting user and is confirmed as accurate.
