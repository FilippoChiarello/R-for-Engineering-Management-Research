METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR CHARACTERIZING A SPECIMEN USING PATTERN ILLUMINATION
</title>

<abstract>
A characterization apparatus including pattern generation. The characterization apparatus is configured to characterize a specimen and or a specimen container in some embodiments. The characterization apparatus includes an imaging location configured to receive a specimen container containing a specimen, one or more image capture devices located at one or more viewpoints adjacent to the imaging location, and one or more light panel assemblies including pattern generation capability located adjacent to the imaging location and configured to provide back lighting. Methods of imaging a specimen and/or specimen container using the pattern generation are described herein, as are other aspects.

<claims>
1. A characterization apparatus, comprising: an imaging location configured to receive a specimen container containing a specimen; an image capture device located adjacent to the imaging location; and a light panel assembly located adjacent to the imaging location configured to provide back lighting of the imaging location, the light panel assembly further configured to display a pattern.
2. The characterization apparatus of claim 1, wherein the light panel assembly comprises: a light source; and a pattern generator configured to produce the pattern.
3. The characterization apparatus of claim 1, wherein the light panel assembly comprises a pattern generator configured to produce the pattern, and wherein the pattern generator is selected from a group including: a liquid crystal display, a thin film transistor screen, a light-emitting diode screen, an organic light-emitting diode screen, electroluminescent display, electronic paper, E ink, and plasma display panel,
4. The characterization apparatus of claim 1, wherein the light panel assembly further comprises a spectrally-switchable light source.
5. The characterization apparatus of claim 4, comprising a spectrally-switchable light source includes a light source switchable between two or more of: white light, red light, green light, blue light, ultraviolet light, near infrared light, and infrared light.
6. The characterization apparatus of claim 1, wherein the light panel assembly comprises: a frame including a first side and a second side; a light source comprising a plurality of individual light sources arranged along the first side and the second side; a light guide positioned adjacent to the plurality of plurality of individual light sources; and a pattern generator positioned in front of the light guide and configured to produce the pattern.
7. The characterization apparatus of claim 6, further comprising: a mask positioned in front of the pattern generator; and a diffuser element.
8. The characterization apparatus of claim 1, wherein the pattern is selected from a group of patterns, including: a variable width pattern; a restricted illumination area pattern; a variable position pattern; a variable height pattern; a variable line number pattern; a dot illumination pattern; a dot array pattern; a modulation transfer function estimation pattern; a Gray-code pattern; and combinations thereof.
9. The characterization apparatus of claim 1, wherein the pattern is switchable.
10. A characterization apparatus, comprising: a specimen carrier locating a specimen container containing a specimen at an imaging location; a light panel assembly located adjacent the imaging location and configured to provide back lighting of the imaging location, the light panel assembly further configured to display a pattern; and an image capture device configured to capture an image of the pattern at the imaging location as imaged through the specimen container and specimen.
11. The characterization apparatus of claim 10, wherein the pattern is selected from a group of patterns, including: a variable width pattern; a restricted illumination area pattern; a variable position pattern; a variable height pattern; a variable line number pattern; a dot illumination pattern; a dot array pattern; a modulation transfer function estimation pattern; a Gray-code pattern; and combinations thereof.
12. The characterization apparatus of claim 10, wherein the light panel assembly further comprises a spectrally-switchable light source.
13. The characterization apparatus of claim 10, comprising a spectrally-switchable light source includes a light source switchable between two or more of: white light, red light, green light, blue light, ultraviolet light, near infrared light, and infrared light.
14. The characterization apparatus of claim 10, comprising an enclosure, the specimen container containing a specimen and at least a front face of the light panel assembly is included in the enclosure, and wherein the pattern is a restricted illumination area pattern operating to reduce an amount of stray light within the enclosure.
15. A method of characterizing a specimen container and/or a specimen, comprising: providing an imaging location configured to receive a specimen container containing a specimen thereat; providing one or more image capture devices adjacent to the imaging location; providing a light panel assembly configured to provide backlighting of the imaging location; displaying a pattern on a front face of the light panel assembly; and capturing an image of the pattern with the one or more image capture devices.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the pattern is selected from the group of patterns including: a variable width pattern; a restricted illumination area pattern; a variable position pattern; a variable height pattern; a variable line number pattern; a dot illumination pattern; a dot array pattern; a modulation transfer function estimation pattern; a Gray-code pattern; and combinations thereof.
17. The method of claim 15, comprising switching the pattern displayed to another pattern.
18. The method of claim 15, comprising determining one or more of: a scattering property of the specimen; a transmittance property of the specimen; an absorption property of the specimen; a refractive index of the specimen; and a fluid turbidity of the specimen.
19. The method of claim 15, comprising determining a presence of an interferent, wherein the interferent is one or more of hemolysis, icterus, and/or lipemia contained in a specimen.
20. The method of claim 15, comprising determining a presence of an artifact in the specimen, wherein the artifact comprises one or more of a clot, a bubble, or foam.
21. The method of claim 15, wherein the capturing of the image of the pattern is through the specimen container and/or specimen.
22. The method of claim 15, comprising capturing one or more reference images of the pattern.
