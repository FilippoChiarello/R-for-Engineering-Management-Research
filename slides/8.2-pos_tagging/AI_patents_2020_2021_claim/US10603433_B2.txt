Operating an infusion pump system
</title>

<abstract>
Some embodiments an infusion pump system can be configured to control dispensation of medicine according to a closed-loop delivery mode that is responsive to feedback information provided from a monitoring device, and the infusion pump system permits a user to interrupt the closed-loop delivery mode for purposes of dispensing a user-selected manual bolus dosage.

<claims>
1. A method of operating a portable insulin infusion pump system, comprising: while operating an infusion pump system to automatically dispense insulin according to a closed-loop delivery mode, detecting a trigger event from a user to initiate a user-selected manual bolus dosage; temporarily interrupting the closed-loop delivery mode; receiving a user input for the user-selected manual bolus dosage; calculating, by the infusion pump system, a calculated dosage amount of the user-selected manual bolus dosage based upon both the user input and an amount of insulin dispensed during the closed-loop delivery mode over a time period immediately prior to said interrupting; dispensing from the infusion pump system the calculated dosage amount; determining that the user-selected manual bolus dosage is administered; and automatically returning to the closed-loop delivery mode in response to determining that the user-selected manual bolus dosage is administered.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the closed-loop delivery mode causes the infusion pump system to dispense insulin in response to feedback information of a user's blood glucose level, and wherein the trigger event comprises actuation of a user interface button indicating a user's request to manually initiate a bolus dispensation that is independent from said feedback information of the user's blood glucose characteristic.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the trigger event comprises actuation of a user interface button indicating a user's request to initiate calculation of a suggested bolus dosage by the infusion pump system.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the infusion pump system comprises a controller including: a user interface display device, control circuitry arranged in a controller housing and being programmed to perform said calculation of the calculated dosage amount of the user-selected manual bolus dosage.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the infusion pump system comprises a pump device including: a pump housing that houses a drive system and an insulin reservoir, the controller housing being removably mountable to the pump housing so that the controller is electrically connected to the drive system.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein said amount of insulin dispensed during the closed-loop delivery mode over the time period comprises an effective-insulin-on-board amount calculated as follows:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?Effective Insulin-on-Board=[Σ(Dosagen*Duration Factor(t)n)]−Estimated Basal Rate,description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"? where n is any positive whole number, and where Duration Factor(t)n, represents a factor discounting the dosage based on an amount of time (t) since its delivery.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising outputting an alert from the infusion pump system in response to a calculated stacking value exceeding a predetermined stacking threshold, wherein the calculated stacking value comprises the calculated dosage amount of the user-selected manual bolus dosage plus the Effective Insulin-on-board.
8. The method of claim 6, wherein the calculated dosage amount of the user-selected manual bolus dosage comprises a calculation of a suggested bolus dosage according to the following function:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?Suggested Bolus Dosage=(Food Offsetting Component)+(Blood Glucose Correction Component)−(Effective Insulin-on-board Component).description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?
9. The method of claim 6, wherein the Estimated Basal Rate is calculated according to the following function:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?Estimated Basal Rate=Total Dose/(T*Scale Down Factor),description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"? where T is a unit of time.
10. A medical infusion pump system, comprising: a portable pump housing configured to receive medicine for dispensation to a user, the pump housing at least partially containing a pump drive system to dispense the medicine through a flow path to the user; and a controller that controls the pump drive system to: dispense the medicine from the portable pump housing according to a closed-loop delivery mode in which the controller autonomously provides insulin dosages to the user in response to feedback information of a user's blood glucose level; receive user input to initiate a user-prompted bolus dosage; in response to receiving the user input to initiate the user-prompted bolus dosage, temporarily interrupt the closed-loop delivery mode; receive a user input for the user-prompted bolus dosage; calculate, by the infusion pump system, a calculated dosage amount of the user-prompted bolus dosage based upon both the user input for the user-prompted bolus dosage and an amount of insulin dispensed during the closed-loop delivery mode over a time period immediately prior to said interrupting; dispense from the infusion pump system the user-prompted bolus dosage; determine that the user-selected manual bolus dosage is administered; and automatically return to the closed-loop delivery mode in response to determining that the user-selected manual bolus dosage is administered.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the input to initiate the user-prompted bolus dosage comprises actuation of a user interface button indicating a user request to manually enter a bolus dosage amount.
12. The system of claim 10, wherein the input to initiate the user-prompted bolus dosage comprises actuation of a user interface button indicating a user request to initiate a calculation, by the infusion pump system, of a suggested bolus dosage.
13. The system of claim 10, wherein the controller comprises a user interface including a display device and a plurality of buttons.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the controller comprises a controller housing that removably attaches to the pump housing.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the controller is electrically connected to the pump drive system when the controller housing is removably attached to the pump housing.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the controller is a reusable device and the pump housing and pump drive system are disposable and nonreusable.
17. The system of claim 10, further comprising a monitoring device that communicates glucose information to the controller, the glucose information being indicative of a blood glucose level of the user.
18. A portable infusion pump system, comprising: a portable pump housing configured to receive medicine for dispensation to a user, the pump housing at least partially containing a pump drive system to dispense the medicine through a flow path to the user; control circuitry that controls the pump drive system to dispense the medicine from the portable pump housing according to a closed-loop delivery mode in which insulin is dispensed in response to feedback information of a user's blood glucose characteristic; and a user interface in communication with the control circuitry and being configured to receive user input to interrupt said closed-loop delivery mode, wherein the control circuitry is configured to: temporarily interrupt the closed-loop delivery mode in response to the user input to interrupt said closed-loop delivery mode; receive manual bolus dosage information indicative of user input received by the user interface, the manual bolus dosage information indicating a numeric value associated with a manual bolus dosage; calculate a calculated dosage amount for the manual bolus dosage based upon the manual bolus dosage information; dispense from the infusion pump system the manual bolus dosage; determine that the manual bolus dosage is administered; and restart the closed-loop delivery mode in response to determining that the manual bolus dosage is administered.
