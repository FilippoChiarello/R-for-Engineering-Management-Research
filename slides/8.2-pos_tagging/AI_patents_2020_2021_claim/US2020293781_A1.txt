FOOD DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION METHOD BASED ON DEEP LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention discloses a food detection and identification method based on deep learning, which realizes food positioning and identification by a deep convolutional network. The method comprises: firstly, training a general multi target positioning network and a classification network by using food pictures; secondly, inputting the results of the positioning network into the classification network; finally, providing a classification result by the classification network. The method uses two deep convolutional networks with different functions to respectively detect and identify the, food, which can effectively reduce the labeling cost of the food and improve the accuracy of positioning and identification.
