METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATICALLY PROTECTING RADIO NETWORK EQUIPMENT IN EXTREME ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems automatically protect radio network equipment in extreme weather conditions such as sand-storms or snow-storms. A pair of phase-shift material grids having different orientations is installed at an air intake of the radio network equipment. One of the grids is powered to open or close the air intake according to a current amount of air-carried particles entering the radio network equipment and a temperature inside the radio network equipment. The current amount of air-carried particles entering the radio network equipment may be detected by a piezoelectric sensor.

1. A method (100) for automatically protecting radio network equipment,
RNE (200), in extreme weather conditions, the method comprising:
installing (S1 10), at an air intake of the RNE, a sensor (210) configured to detect a current amount of air-carried particles entering the RNE, and a pair of phase-shift material grids (220) having different orientations and configured to open or close the air intake; and
automatically powering (120) one grid of the phase-shift material grids (220) to open or close the air intake according to the current amount of air-carried particles and a temperature inside the RNE.
2. The method of claim 1 , wherein the sensor is a piezoelectric sensor.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein, when power is applied to a first grid of the pair no power is injected into a second grid of the pair, and, when power is applied to the second grid no power is injected into the first grid.
4. The method of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein one grid of the pair is perpendicular to the second grid and isolated from the second grid so as to prevent power and heat transfer there-between.
5. The method of any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the powering one of the pair of phase-shift material grids causes a 20-50K temperature increase thereof.
6. The method of any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the powering one of the phase-shift material grids causes the air intake to open or to close with 2-5 mm.
7. The method of any of claims 1 to 6, wherein the RIME includes a radio base station, RBS, and the method further comprises:
reducing data traffic in the RBS when the current amount of air-carried particles detected by the sensor triggers closing of the air intake.
