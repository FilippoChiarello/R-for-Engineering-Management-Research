<title>
Adaptive Pixel Sampling Order for Temporally Dense Rendering
</title>

<abstract>
A method dynamically selects one of a first sampling order and a second sampling order for a ray trace of pixels in a tile where the selection is based on a motion vector for the tile. The sampling order may be a bowtie pattern or an hourglass pattern.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: selecting a per-tile sampling order from among a plurality of different sampling orders for each tile of a plurality of tiles of a video frame; the selection of the per-tile sampling order based on one or both of a motion vector and neighboring pixels for the tile; generating a subframe for each pixel position in the tile, resulting in a plurality of subframes; and combining the subframes into a rendering of the video frame.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the selection of the per-tile sampling order is based on both of the motion vector and the neighboring pixels for the tile.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the selection of the per-tile sampling order is based on the motion vector and not on the neighboring pixels for the tile.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the selection of the per-tile sampling order is based on the neighboring pixels for the tile and not on the motion vector.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: selecting the per-tile sampling order from among a bowtie sampling order and an hourglass sampling order.
6. The method of claim 1 further comprising: selecting the per-tile sampling order based on an angle of the motion vector.
7. The method of claim 1 further comprising: selecting the per-tile sampling order based on a length of the motion vector.
8. The method of claim 7 further comprising: selecting the per-tile sampling order based on a fractional portion of the length of the motion vector.
9. The method of claim 1 further comprising: selecting the per-tile sampling order based on an angle of the motion vector and a fractional portion of a length of the motion vector.
10. The method of claim 1 wherein each tile is a 2×2 block of pixels.
11. The method of claim 1 further comprising: selecting a supersampling pattern for pixels in the tile based on the motion vector.
12. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, the computer-readable storage medium including instructions that configure a computer to: select a ray tracing pixel sampling order for each tile of a plurality of tiles in a video frame; and varying the pixel sampling order between a first sampling order and a second sampling order for different tiles of the video frame based on an angle of at least one motion vector for the different tiles.
13. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein the first sampling order is a bowtie sampling order and the second sampling order is an hourglass sampling order.
14. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 12 wherein the instructions further configure the computer to render a different subframe for each position in a selected pixel sampling order.
15. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 14 wherein there are four pixel positions in the selected sampling order.
16. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 14 wherein the different subframes combine to generate a rendered frame.
17. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 12 wherein the instructions further configure the computer to select the sampling order based a length of the motion vector.
18. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 17 wherein: selection of the pixel sampling order is based on an angle of the motion vector for one or more first ranges of the angle; and selection of the pixel sampling order is random for one or more second ranges of the angle.
19. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 12 wherein the instructions further configure the computer to select a supersampling jitter pattern for static pixels in the tiles and a centric-based supersampling pattern for dynamic pixels in the tiles.
20. A computing apparatus, the computing apparatus comprising: a processor; and a memory storing instructions that, when executed by the processor, configure the apparatus to: select a sampling order comprising one of a bowtie sampling order and an hourglass sampling order for a ray trace of pixels in a tile having a width W and a height H; and for each of W*H pixels in the tile, generate a subframe comprising only pixels from position j from each of the tiles.
21. The computing apparatus of claim 20 wherein selection of the sampling order is based on an angle of a motion vector derived for the tile for at least one range of the angle.
22. The computing apparatus of claim 21 wherein selection of the sampling order is further based on a fractional portion of a length of the motion vector.
23. The computing apparatus of claim 21 where selection of the sampling order is random for at least one other range of the angle.
24. A computing apparatus, the computing apparatus comprising: a processor; and a memory storing instructions that, when executed by the processor, configure the apparatus to: select a sampling order comprising one of a first ray trace sampling order and a second ray trace sampling order on a per-tile basis for each of a plurality of tiles of a video frame; each of the first sampling order and the second sampling order comprising N pixel sample positions; generate N subframes each comprising only pixels from a same pixel sample position in each of the tiles; and update the sampling order selection once per the generation of N subframes.
