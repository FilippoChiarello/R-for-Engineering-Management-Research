SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR HIERARCHICAL PROCESS MINING
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for hierarchical process mining are disclosed. In one embodiment, in an information processing apparatus comprising at least one compute processor, a method for hierarchical process mining may include: (1) collecting, from a data source, data comprising a plurality of attributes; (2) correlating the data; (3) creating a hierarchy of the correlated data by clustering the correlated data; (4) validating the hierarchy by verifying that each sub-value in the hierarchy fits into a higher level of the hierarchy; (5) processing the corelated data with a process mining algorithm to identify a process model; (6) combining the validated hierarchy with the identified process model; and (7) graphically presenting the hierarchy in an interactive manner, wherein the hierarchy may be interacted with by moving up or down in the hierarchy.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method for hierarchical process mining comprising:
in an information processing apparatus comprising at least one computer processor:
collecting, from a data source, data comprising a plurality of attributes;
correlating the data;
creating a hierarchy of the correlated data by clustering the correlated data;
validating the hierarchy by verifying that each subvalue in the hierarchy fits into a higher level of the hierarchy;
processing the corelated data with a process mining algorithm to identify a process model;
combining the validated hierarchy with the identified process model; and
graphically presenting the hierarchy in an interactive manner, wherein the hierarchy may be interacted with by moving up or down in the hierarchy.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the data comprises a data log, and each column in the data log is an attribute.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein each attribute is a level in the hierarchy.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the data is received as a plurality of data structures that are linked by a correlation indicator or foreign key.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the data is received from an event log merge.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the data is correlated using a data correlation algorithm.
7 The method of claim 1, wherein the data is correlated based on a timestamp.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the data is correlated based on a process or event identifier.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the data is correlated based on a human or system resource.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the data is correlated based on an application.
11. A system for hierarchical process mining comprising:
a plurality of data sources;
a user electronic device comprising a display; and
a server comprising at least one computer processor;
wherein a computer program or application executed by the server performs the following:
collects data comprising a plurality of attributes from the plurality of data sources;
correlates the data;
creates a hierarchy of the correlated data by clustering the correlated data; validates the hierarchy by verifying that each subvalue in the hierarchy fits into a higher level of the hierarchy;
processes the corelated data with a process mining algorithm to identify a process model;
combines the validated hierarchy with the identified process model; and
graphically presents the hierarchy on the display in an interactive manner, wherein the hierarchy may be interacted with by moving up or down in the hierarchy.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the data comprises a data log, and each column in the data log is an attribute.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein each attribute is a level in the hierarchy.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the data is received as a plurality of data structures that are linked by a correlation indicator or foreign key.
15. The system of claim 11, wherein the data is received from an event log merge.
16. The system of claim 11, wherein the data is correlated using a data correlation algorithm.
17. The system of claim 11, wherein the data is correlated based on a timestamp.
18. The system of claim 11, wherein the data is correlated based on a process or event identifier.
19. The system of claim 11, wherein the data is correlated based on a human or system resource.
20. The system of claim 11, wherein the data is correlated based on an application.
