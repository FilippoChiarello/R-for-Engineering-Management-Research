OBJECT ORIENTATION AND/OR POSITION FOR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING
</title>

<abstract>
A non-transitory machine-readable storage medium storing instructions executable by a processor described. In some examples, the instructions cause the processor to receive object data representing an object to be manufactured by an additive manufacturing process. A derivation process on the object data to derive a data set representing the object, the data set having a predetermined number of data fields. The data set is provided to data processing system comprising data based on previously determined manufacturing orientations and/or position. An output is received from the data processing system representing a manufacturing orientation and/or manufacturing position of the object.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A non-transitory machine-readable storage medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to:
receive object data representing an object to be manufactured by an additive manufacturing process;
perform a derivation process on the object data to derive a data set representing the object, the data set having a predetermined number of data fields;
provide the data set to a data processing system comprising data based on previously determined manufacturing orientations and/or positions; and
receive an output from the data processing system representing a manufacturing orientation and/or manufacturing position of the object.
2. A non-transitory machine-readable storage medium according to claim 1 , wherein the object data comprises planar surface data representing a plurality of planar surfaces, and the derivation process comprises:
determining a plurality of normal vectors, each of the plurality of normal vectors corresponding to a respective planar surface of the plurality of planar surfaces;
determining a plurality of direction characteristics, each of the plurality of direction characteristics corresponding to a respective normal vector of the plurality of normal vectors;
assigning values to the data fields based on the plurality of direction characteristics.
3. A non-transitory machine-readable storage medium according to claim 2, wherein the derivation process comprises assigning values to the data fields based on a distribution of the plurality of direction characteristics.
4. A non-transitory machine-readable storage medium according to claim 3, wherein the distribution is weighted according to an area of the planar surface to which a respective normal vector corresponds.
5. A non-transitory machine-readable storage medium according to claim 2, wherein:
each of the plurality of normal vectors comprises a vector normalized to a predetermined length;
the plurality of direction characteristics each comprises a set of components of a corresponding normal vector, and determining a direction characteristic comprises determining values of the components of the corresponding normal vector;
the data fields each represent a respective combination of vector coordinates; and
values are assigned to the data fields according to a number of normal vectors having a combination of vector coordinates corresponding to a respective data field, weighted according to an area of the planar surface(s) to which the normal vector(s) corresponds.
6. A non-transitory machine-readable storage medium according to claim 1 , wherein the object data is included in a stereolithography (.STL) file or a 3mf file.
7. Apparatus comprising:
a storage medium to store a data processing system comprising data based on previously determined manufacturing orientations; and
a processor to:
receive object data representing an object to be manufactured by an additive manufacturing process;
perform a derivation process to derive a data set representing the object from the object data, the data set having a predetermined number of data fields; provide the data set to the data processing system; and
receive an output from the data processing system representing a manufacturing orientation and/or manufacturing position of the object.
8. The apparatus according to claim 7, wherein:
the data processing system comprises a plurality of data processing components, each of the data processing components being to prioritize a respective object characteristic;
the apparatus comprises an interface to receive a user input to indicate a selected object characteristic;
the processor is to select a first data processing component from the plurality of data processing components based on the user input; and
the data set is provided to the first data processing component.
9. The apparatus according to claim 8, wherein the selected object characteristic comprises an appearance characteristic of the object, an accuracy characteristic of the object or a mechanical characteristic of the object.
10. The apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the data processing system comprises a neural network system.
1 1 . A method of selecting a manufacturing position and/or manufacturing orientation of an object to be formed by an additive manufacturing process, the method comprising: receiving object data, the object data representing an object to be manufactured by an additive manufacturing process; receiving a user input indicating a selected object characteristic of the object; providing the object data to a data processing system to determine a manufacturing orientation and/or manufacturing position of the object on the basis of the selected object characteristic.
12. A method according to claim 1 1 , comprising receiving an output from the data processing system representing a manufacturing orientation and/or position of the object.
13. A method according to claim 12, comprising manufacturing the object at the manufacturing position or in the manufacturing orientation represented by the output.
14. A method according to claim 12, wherein:
the data processing system comprises a machine learning system; and the method comprises:
comparing the output from the data processing system to a manufacturing orientation and/or manufacturing position selected by a human user; and
training the machine learning system on basis of the comparison.
15. A method according to claim 1 1 , comprising receiving an indication that a manufacturing orientation and/or manufacturing position of the object is to be determined automatically and providing the object data to the data processing system in response to the indication.
