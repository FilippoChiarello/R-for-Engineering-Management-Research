DYNAMIC ENDPOINT COMMUNICATION CHANNELS
</title>

<abstract>
Automated concierge assistant service to handle a wide variety of topics and user intents via a common interface. The concierge service can be part of a connection management system that can dynamically manage and facilitate conversations between a user making a request and one or or more social network endpoints including a social network member and an agent. The user intent is determined by natural language interaction between the user and the automated assistant using artificial intelligence.

<claims>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A non-transitory computer-readable medium comprising instructions stored thereon, the instructions effective to cause a connection management system to: receive, from a user device, a natural language communication;
interpret, an intent of the natural language communication;
automatically determine, based on the intent, a social network member endpoint to receive the natural language communication, the social network member endpoint being selected from a collection of endpoints including at least one agent and at least one social network member; and
facilitate a first conversation between the user device and the social network member endpoint to handle the intent of the natural language communication; and
send the natural language communication to the social network member endpoint.
2. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 1 , wherein the instructions further cause the connection management system to:
monitor the first conversation for subsequent communications between the user device and the social network member endpoint;
detect an action trigger in the first conversation, wherein an action trigger requires an action to be taken by the connection management system.
3. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 2, wherein the instructions further cause the connection management system to:
after detection of the action trigger, provide a message in first conversation.
4. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 3 , wherein the instructions further cause the connection management system to:
after detection of the action trigger, send a private message to the user device, or to send a private message to the social network member endpoint.
5. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 2, wherein the instructions further cause the connection management system to:
after detection of the action trigger, add a second endpoint to the first conversation; and send a communication that is part of the first conversation to the second endpoint.
6. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 5, wherein the instructions further cause the connection management system to:
after detection of the action trigger, drop the social network member endpoint or the second endpoint from the first conversation, and discontinue sending communications that are part of the first conversation to the dropped endpoint.
7. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 1 , wherein the instructions further cause the connection management system to:
monitor the first conversation for subsequent communications between the user device and the social network member endpoint;
determine that the first conversation should be closed; and
close the first conversation.
8. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 1 , wherein the instructions further cause the connection management system to:
monitor the first conversation for subsequent communications between the user device and the social network member endpoint;
determine that the first conversation has gone dormant;
send a communication as part of the first conversation to the user device to resume the first conversation.
9. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 1 , wherein the instructions further cause the connection management system to:
monitor communications from the user device for a subsequent natural language communication;
interpret the intent of the subsequent natural language communication; determine that the subsequent natural language communication is not part of the first conversation;
determine, based on the intent, a second endpoint to receive the natural language communication;
open a second conversation between the user device and the second endpoint to handle the intent of the subsequent natural language communication; and
send the subsequent natural language communication to the second endpoint.
10. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 9, wherein the instructions further cause the connection management system to:
continue to monitor communications from the user device for additional
communications;
determine whether the additional communications pertain to the first conversation or the second conversation;
forward the additional communications to the social network member endpoint when the additional communications pertain to the first conversation and forward the additional communications to the second endpoint when the additional communications pertain to the second conversation; thereby maintain the first conversation and the second conversation concurrently.
