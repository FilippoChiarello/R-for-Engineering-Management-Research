METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HIGH DEFINITION MAP BASED VEHICLE CONTROL FOR ASSISTED DRIVING
</title>

<abstract>
The present application generally relates to a method and apparatus for generating an action policy for controlling an autonomous vehicle. In particular, the method and apparatus are operative for determining a following distance between a host vehicle and a lead vehicle and a lead vehicle speed, generating a lane change request in response to the following distance, a host vehicle speed and the lead vehicle speed, determining an available lane in response to an image and the lane change request, generating a lane change command in response to the available lane, generating a control signal in response to the lane change request and a map data and controlling the vehicle to execute a lane change action in response to the control signal.

<claims>
1. An apparatus comprising: a first processor for calculating a following distance in response to a radar data file and for generating a change lane request in response to the following distance being less than a threshold value; a second processor for receiving the change lane request and for determining a lane availability in response to an image and the change lane request and for generating a lane change control signal in response to the lane availability; a third processor for calculating a lane change route in response to a map data, and the lane change control signal; a memory for storing an episode generated in response to the radar data, the lane change request, the lane change control signal and the lane change route; and a vehicle controller executing a lane change in response to the episode.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the first processor is a longitudinal processor for maintaining the following distance in an adaptive cruise control system.
3. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the second processor is a latitudinal processor for performing a lane centering operation in an adaptive cruise control system.
4. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the third processor is a lane change processor for performing the lane change in an adaptive cruise control system.
5. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the radar data file is generated in response to a vehicular adaptive cruise control data log.
6. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the lane change is executed before the following distance reaches a minimum value.
7. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the episode is generated in response to multiple lane change actions.
8. A vehicular control system comprising: a memory for storing a lane change episode and a map data; a radar sensor for detecting a distance to a lead vehicle; a first processor for generating a lane change request in response to the distance; a camera for generating an image of an adjacent lane; a second processor for determining a lane availability in response to the image and for generating a lane change command in response to the lane availability; a third processor for determining a lane change route in response to the lane change command, the episode, the map data and for generating a lane change control signal in response to the lane change route; and a vehicle controller for executing the lane change in response to the lane change control signal.
9. The vehicular control system of claim 8 wherein the first processor is a longitudinal processor for maintaining the following distance in an adaptive cruise control system.
10. The vehicular control system of claim 8 wherein the second processor is a latitudinal processor for performing a lane centering operation in an adaptive cruise control system.
11. The vehicular control system of claim 8 wherein the third processor is a lane change processor for controlling the lane change in an adaptive cruise control system.
12. The vehicular control system of claim 8 wherein the vehicular control system is operative to perform an adaptive cruise control function in an assisted driving equipped vehicle.
13. The vehicular control system of claim 8 wherein the third processor is further operative to update the episode according to a reinforced learning algorithm.
14. A method for controlling a vehicle comprising: determining a following distance between a host vehicle and a lead vehicle and a lead vehicle speed; generating a lane change request in response to the following distance, a host vehicle speed and the lead vehicle speed; determining an available lane in response to an image and the lane change request; generating a lane change command in response to the available lane; generating a control signal in response to the lane change request and a map data; and controlling the vehicle to execute a lane change action in response to the control signal.
15. The method of claim 14 further comprising wherein the control signal is further generated in response to a global positioning system data.
16. The method of claim 14 wherein the host vehicle speed is reduced in response to the available lane indicating that a lane is not available.
17. The method of claim 14 wherein the following distance is determined in response to a radar signal.
18. The method of claim 14 wherein the image is generated by a side view camera mounted on the host vehicle.
19. The method of claim 14 wherein the control signal is generated in response to a lane change action episode and the map data.
20. The method of claim 14 further comprising updating a lane change episode in response to the control.
