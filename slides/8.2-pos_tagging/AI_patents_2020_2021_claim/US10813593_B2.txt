<title>
Using visual context to timely trigger measuring physiological parameters
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for automatically performing one or more physiological measurements. In various embodiments, image and audio data of a setting in which a patient is present may be acquired via one or more recording devices (102). A determination may be made based on the acquired image and audio data of a state of activity associated with the patient. Based on the determined state of activity associated with the patient, a corresponding one or more physiological measurements of the patient to be obtained may be identified. One or more health sensors (122) may then be caused to be operated to obtain the corresponding one or more physiological measurements.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for automatically performing one or more physiological measurements, comprising: acquiring, by one or more processors via one or more recording devices, image and audio data of a setting in which a patient is present; acquiring, by the one or more processors from one or more motion sensors, one or more signals indicative of motion undertaken by the patient; determining, by the one or more processors based on the acquired image and audio data, a state of activity associated with the patient; identifying, by the one or more processors based on the determined state of activity associated with the patient, a corresponding one or more physiological measurements of the patient to be obtained; causing, by the one or more processors, one or more health sensors to be operated to obtain the corresponding one or more physiological measurements; and executing, by the one or more processors, a measurement adjustment algorithm to filter and normalize the one or more obtained physiological measurements to reduce or eliminate one or more motion artifacts detected by the one or more motion sensors.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the causing comprises providing, by the one or more processors at an output device, output to prompt medical personnel to operate the one or more health sensors to obtain the corresponding one or more physiological measurements.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the causing comprises transmitting, by the one or more processors via a communication module, to a notification device, a command configured to cause the notification device to prompt medical personnel to operate the one or more health sensors to obtain the corresponding one or more physiological measurements.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the causing comprises automatically operating the one or more health sensors to obtain the corresponding one or more physiological measurements.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the automatically operating comprises transmitting, by the one or more processors through a communication module, one or more commands configured to cause the one or more health sensors to obtain the one or more physiological measurements.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the state of activity comprises performing image processing on the acquired image data to identify motion undertaken by the patient.
7. A system for obtaining one or more physiological measurements comprising: an input for receiving image data acquired by one or more recording devices of a setting in which a patient is present; a sensor input for receiving one or more physiological measurements obtained by one or more health sensors from the patient; one or more motion sensors for generating one or more signals indicative of motion by the patient; and a patient monitoring device operably coupled with the one or more recording devices, the one or more motion sensors, and the one or more health sensors, the patient monitoring device configured to: perform image processing on the acquired image data; determine, based on the image processing, a state of activity associated with the patient; select one or more physiological measurements to be obtained from the patient based on the determined activity state; cause the one or more health sensors to be operated to obtain the corresponding one or more physiological measurements; and execute a measurement adjustment algorithm to filter and normalize the one or more obtained physiological measurements to reduce or eliminate one or more motion artifacts detected by the one or more motion sensors.
8. The system of claim 7, further comprising an output device, wherein the patient monitoring device is further configured to provide, at the output device, output to prompt medical personnel to operate the one or more health sensors to obtain the corresponding one or more physiological measurements.
9. The system of claim 7, further comprising a notification device, wherein the patient monitoring device is further configured to transmit, to the notification device, a command configured to cause the notification device to prompt medical personnel to operate the one or more health sensors to obtain the corresponding one or more physiological measurements.
10. The system of claim 7, wherein the patient monitoring device is further configured to automatically operate the one or more health sensors to obtain the corresponding one or more physiological measurements.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the patient monitoring device is further configured to transmit one or more commands configured to cause the one or more health sensors to obtain the one or more physiological measurements.
12. The system of claim 7, wherein the patient monitoring device is further configured to determine perform image processing on the acquired image data to identify motion undertaken the patient.
