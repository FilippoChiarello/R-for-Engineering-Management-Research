PREDICTIVE ANOMALY HANDLING IN A SERVICE PROVIDER SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
There is a need for solutions that perform predictive natural language processing with improved efficiency and/or accuracy. This need can be addressed by, for example, by detecting an anomaly condition in the service provider system based on affected user activity data items associated with the service provider system; determining affected user profiles, wherein each affected user profile is predicted to experience the anomaly condition; determining, for each group of affected user profiles, affected user intentions based user activity data items associated with the group of affected user profiles; generating a support communication for each affected user profile in the group of affected user profiles based on the affected user intentions for the group; and causing a transmission of each support communication to each affected user profile in the group of affected user profiles.
