<title>
UNIVERSAL ACOUSTIC MODELING USING NEURAL MIXTURE MODELS
</title>

<abstract>
According to some embodiments, a universal modeling system may include a plurality of domain expert models to each receive raw input data (e.g., a stream of audio frames containing speech utterances) and provide a domain expert output based on the raw input data. A neural mixture component may then generate a weight corresponding to each domain expert model based on information created by the plurality of domain expert models (e.g., hidden features and/or row convolution). The weights might be associated with, for example, constrained scalar numbers, unconstrained scaler numbers, vectors, matrices, etc. An output layer may provide a universal modeling system output (e.g., an automatic speech recognition result) based on each domain expert output after being multiplied by the corresponding weight for that domain expert model.
