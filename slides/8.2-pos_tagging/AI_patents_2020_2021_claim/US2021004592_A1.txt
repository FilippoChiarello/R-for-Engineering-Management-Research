SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR IMPROVED LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed here are systems, methods, apparatus, and/or non-transitory computer-readable storage comprising machine-readable code for the development and application of high-resolution crop yield models. The disclosed yield models may be captured yield data and corresponding remote sensing data covering relatively limited areas. Embodiments of the disclosed yield models may be capable of estimating spatial yield characteristics in areas for which accurate yield data are not available (and/or not practical to acquire), thereby enabling more widespread application of integrated land management techniques.
