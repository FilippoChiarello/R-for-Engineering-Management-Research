USER INTERFACE
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments are directed to a user interface for superimposingly displaying, on a map, a plurality of travel route patterns reflecting tendencies of movements of a moving object and a new travel route predicted using the plurality of travel route patterns. The plurality of travel route patterns being extracted in advance by analyzing traveling history data of the moving object and being displayed in different manners, according to a prediction probability between each of the plurality of travel route patterns and the new travel route.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for providing a user interface, the method comprising: providing the user interface, on a computer display, for superimposingly displaying on a map: a plurality of travel route patterns reflecting tendencies of movements of a single moving object, and a new travel route predicted using the plurality of travel route patterns; the plurality of travel route patterns being determined in advance of the displaying by analyzing traveling history data of the single moving object; and wherein the plurality of travel route patterns are displayed in different manners according to a prediction probability between each of the plurality of travel route patterns and the new travel route.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein, the plurality of travel route patterns extracted in advance of the displaying by analyzing traveling history data of the single moving object further comprises: analyzing traveling history data of two or more moving objects.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein the user-interface is implemented in a navigation system
4. The method according to claim 2, wherein the superimposing displaying further comprises displaying at least one route on the basis of the traveling history data of the plural moving objects.
5. The method according to claim 1, the method further comprising: determining, using a threshold value of variation of the prediction probability, a feature point reflecting a changing point of the variation.
6. The method according to claim 5, the method further comprising: generating playback data of the new travel route using the feature point.
7. The method according to claim 6, wherein the superimposing displaying further comprises displaying the playback using the playback data along a time axis.
8. The method according to claim 3, the method further comprising: receiving an input from a user to change or select a parameter for extracting a feature point.
9. The method according to claim 8, the method further comprising: determining a feature point using the changed or selected parameter.
10. The method according to claim 1, wherein the superimposing displaying further comprises displaying at least one route on the basis of traveling history data of the moving object.
11. The method according to claim 1, the method further comprising: allowing a user to change or select a parameter associated with a plurality of travel route patterns, a parameter associated with the new travel route, or a parameter associated with current traveling data.
12. The method according to claim 8, the method further comprising: recalculating a prediction probability between each of the plurality of travel route patterns and the new travel route using the changed or selected parameter.
13. The method according to claim 12, further comprising replacing the displayed travel route patterns with a display of a plurality of recalculated travel route patterns rendered in different manners according to the recalculated prediction probability.
14. The method according to claim 1, wherein the plurality of travel route patterns were obtained as an output of a machine learning model.
15. The method according to claim 1, further comprising displaying variation of the prediction probability in a format of a comparative manner.
16. The method according to claim 1, wherein each of the plurality of travel route patterns is associated with one of: a prediction probability between each of the plurality of travel route patterns and the new travel route, or a prediction probability associated with a time stamp.
17. The method according to claim 1, wherein the user-interface is implemented in one of: a debug system for a navigation system or a navigation system.
18. The method according to claim 1, wherein the traveling history data of the moving object is used when carrying out a Most Probable Path and Destination Prediction algorithm.
19. A computer system, comprising: one or more processors; and a memory storing a program which, when executed on the processor, performs operations of providing a user interface, the operations comprising: providing the user interface, on a computer display, for superimposingly displaying on a map: a plurality of travel route patterns reflecting tendencies of movements of a single moving object, and a new travel route predicted using the plurality of travel route patterns; the plurality of travel route patterns being determined in advance of the displaying by analyzing traveling history data of the single moving object; and wherein the plurality of travel route patterns are displayed in different manners according to a prediction probability between each of the plurality of travel route patterns and the new travel route.
20. A computer program product for providing a user interface, the computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by a computer to cause the computer to perform a method comprising: providing the user interface, on a computer display, for superimposingly displaying on a map: a plurality of travel route patterns reflecting tendencies of movements of a single moving object, and a new travel route predicted using the plurality of travel route patterns; the plurality of travel route patterns being determined in advance of the displaying by analyzing traveling history data of the single moving object; and wherein the plurality of travel route patterns are displayed in different manners according to a prediction probability between each of the plurality of travel route patterns and the new travel route.
