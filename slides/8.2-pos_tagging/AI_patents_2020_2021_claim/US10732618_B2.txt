<title>
Machine health monitoring, failure detection and prediction using non-parametric data
</title>

<abstract>
According to some embodiments, system and methods are provided, comprising receiving, at a machine health module, non-parametric data associated with operation of an installed product; generating, via the machine health module, a health status for at least one of a failure type and a remaining useful life of the installed product, based on the received non-parametric data; and generating an operating response of the installed product based on the generated health status. Numerous other aspects are provided.

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method comprising: receiving, at a machine health module, non-parametric data associated with operation of an installed product; generating, via the machine health module, at least one of a diagnosis for a failure type and a prognosis of a remaining useful life of the installed product, based on the received non-parametric data; and operating the installed product based on the generated at least one of the diagnosis and the prognosis.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the non-parametric data is at least one of an operator log, a machine calibration log, a machine software log, an event history data log, and a maintenance and repair log.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one of the diagnosis and the prognosis for the installed product is generated based on non-parametric data associated with two or more installed products.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the non-parametric data is any data beyond machine sensor data which cannot be stored in relational databases.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: comparing the generated at least one diagnosis and prognosis to a second at least one diagnosis and prognosis based on parametric data; and generating a confidence level for the generated at least one diagnosis and prognosis and the second at least one diagnosis and prognosis based on the comparison.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the generated at least one diagnosis and prognosis and the second at least one diagnosis and prognosis are in a same format prior to the comparison.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the at least one diagnosis and prognosis further comprises: generating, via the machine health module, the diagnosis for the installed product based on the received non-parametric data.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the diagnosis is generated based on: detecting at least one anomaly in the non-parametric data.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the at least one diagnosis and prognosis further comprises: generating the prognosis for the installed product based on the received non-parametric data.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the at least one diagnosis and prognosis further comprises: pre-processing the received non-parametric data.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising: applying feature engineering to the pre-processing data.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein feature engineering further comprises: extracting one or more features from the pre-processed data; and determining one or more patterns to associate with each extracted feature.
13. A system comprising: a machine health module; a memory storing processor-executable process steps; and a non-parametric data processor coupled to the memory, and in communication with the machine health module and operative to execute the processor-executable steps to cause the system to: receive, at a machine health module, non-parametric data associated with operation of an installed product; generate, via the machine health module, at least one of a diagnosis for a failure type and a prognosis of a remaining useful life of the installed product, based on the received non-parametric data; and operate the installed product based on the generated at least one of the diagnosis and the prognosis.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the non-parametric data is at least one of an operator log, a machine calibration log, a machine software log, an event history data log, and a maintenance and repair log.
15. The system of claim 13, wherein the at least one of the diagnosis and the prognosis for the installed product is generated based on non-parametric data associated with two or more installed products.
16. The system of claim 13, wherein the non-parametric data is any data beyond machine sensor data which cannot be stored in relational databases.
17. The system of claim 13, wherein generating the at least one of the diagnosis and the prognosis further comprises processor-executable steps to cause the system to: pre-process the received non-parametric data.
18. The system of claim 17, further comprising processor-executable steps to cause the system to: apply feature engineering to the pre-processed data.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein the application of feature engineering further comprises processor-executable steps to cause the system to: extract one or more features from the pre-processed data; and determine one or more patterns to associate with each extracted feature.
20. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing program code, the program code executable by a computer system to cause the computer system to: receive, at a machine health module, non-parametric data associated with operation of an installed product; generate, via the machine health module, at least one of a diagnosis for a failure type and a prognosis of a remaining useful life of the installed product, based on the received non-parametric data; and operating the installed product based on the generated at least one of the diagnosis and the prognosis.
21. The medium claim 20, wherein the non-parametric data is at least one of an operator log, a machine calibration log, a machine software log, an event history data log, and a maintenance and repair log.
22. The medium of claim 21, wherein the non-parametric data is any data beyond machine sensor data which cannot be stored in relational databases.
