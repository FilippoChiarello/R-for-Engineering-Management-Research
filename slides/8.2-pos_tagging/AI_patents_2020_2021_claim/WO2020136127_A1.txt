SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ENHANCING REM SLEEP WITH SENSORY STIMULATION
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure pertains to a system and method for automatically detecting rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and delivering sensory stimulation to prolong REM duration, without disturbing sleep. The sensory stimulation maybe auditory or other stimulation. The system and method ensure timely delivery of the stimulation and automatically adjust the amount, intensity, and/or timing of stimulation as necessary. REM sleep is detected based brain activity, cardiac activity and/or other information. REM sleep may be detected and/or predicted by a trained neural network. The amount, timing, and/or intensity of the sensory stimulation may be determined and/or modulated to enhance REM sleep in a subject based on one or more values of one or more intermediate layers of the neural network and one or more brain activity and/or cardiac activity parameters.
