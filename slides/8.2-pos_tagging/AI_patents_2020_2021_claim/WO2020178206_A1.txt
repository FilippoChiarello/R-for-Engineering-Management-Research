ACCESS CONTROL
</title>

<abstract>
A computer implemented method of access control for a user device having at least one component for determining behaviours of the user, the method comprising: accessing a machine learning classifier trained based on at least one prior behaviour of the user using the device, the classifier classifying user behaviour as compliant or non-compliant such that compliant behaviour is determined by the classifier to be consistent with prior behaviour for permitting access to the device; and responsive to a determination that a subsequent behaviour is classified as non-compliant, requesting a credential-based authentication of the user and permitting access to the device in response to the credential-based authentication, wherein permitting access to the device further includes constructively training the classifier based on the subsequent behaviour as a compliant behaviour by providing the subsequent behaviour as an additional training example.

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method of access control for a user device having at least one component for determining behaviours of the user, the method comprising:
accessing a machine learning classifier trained based on at least one prior behaviour of the user using the device, the classifier classifying user behaviour as compliant or noncompliant such that compliant behaviour is determined by the classifier to be consistent with prior behaviour for permitting access to the device; and
responsive to a determination that a subsequent behaviour is classified as noncompliant, requesting a credential-based authentication of the user and permitting access to the device in response to the credential-based authentication,
wherein permitting access to the device further includes constructively training the classifier based on the subsequent behaviour as a compliant behaviour by providing the subsequent behaviour as an additional training example. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein preventing access to the device further includes constructively training the classifier based on the subsequent behaviour as a non-compliant behaviour by providing the subsequent behaviour as an additional training example.
3. The method of any preceding claim wherein the component is one or more of: a location sensor; a position sensor; an orientation sensor; an accelerometer; an input device; a touch-screen; a temperature sensor; a time determiner; a pressure sensor; an olfactory sensor; a chemical sensor; a biometric sensor; a heart rate sensor; a cardiogram generator; a sound sensor; a voice recognition component; a handwriting recognition component; a global positioning system; and a gyroscope.
4. The method of any preceding claim wherein the credential-based authentication includes one or more of: an authentication scheme using a user identifier and password; a key-based user authentication scheme; a token-based user authentication scheme; and a multi-factor authentication scheme in which authentication is requested via a different device.
5. A computer system including a processor and memory storing computer program code for performing the steps of the method of any preceding claim.
6. A computer program element comprising computer program code to, when loaded into a computer system and executed thereon, cause the computer to perform the steps of a method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4.
