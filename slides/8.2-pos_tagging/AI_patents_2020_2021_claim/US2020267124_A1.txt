METHOD FOR DETERRING MALICIOUS NETWORK TRAFFIC
</title>

<abstract>
A method for deterring malicious network traffic heading for a data center from an external user via a cloud includes the step of receiving at least one packet of inline network traffic before the data center. Then, the packet of the inline network traffic is converted into at least one network traffic-related graphic. Then, the network traffic-related graphic is compared with model-related graphics. Then, it is determined whether the network traffic-related graphic matches any of the model-related graphics. A warning is provided or the packet of the inline network traffic is blocked if the network traffic-related graphic matches any of the model-related graphics. The packet of the inline network traffic is transferred to the data center if the network traffic-related graphic does not match any of the model-related graphics.

<claims>
1. A method for deterring malicious network traffic heading for a data center from an external user via a cloud, the method comprising the steps of: providing a deterring apparatus; using the deterring apparatus to receive at least one packet of inline network traffic before the data center; using the deterring apparatus to convert the packet of the inline network traffic into at least one network traffic-related graphic; using the deterring apparatus to compare the network traffic-related graphic with model-related graphics; using the deterring apparatus to determine whether the network traffic-related graphic matches any of the model-related graphics; using the deterring apparatus to provide a warning or block the packet of the inline network traffic if the network traffic-related graphic matches any of the model-related graphics; and using the deterring apparatus to transfer the packet of the inline network traffic to the data center if the network traffic-related graphic does not match any of the model-related graphics.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the step of providing a warning or blocking the packet of the inline network traffic comprises the step of writing data about the packet of the inline network traffic in a log file.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the step of comparing the network traffic-related graphic with the model-related graphic comprises the step of training to derive optimized model-related graphics from the model-related graphics and the network traffic-related graphic, and the optimized model-related graphics are to be used as model-related graphics with which a next network traffic-related graphic is to be compared.
4. A method for deterring malicious network traffic heading for a data center from an external user via a cloud, the method comprising the steps of: providing a deterring apparatus; using the deterring apparatus to receive at least one packet of inline network traffic before the data center; using the deterring apparatus to convert the packet of the inline network traffic into at least one network traffic-related graphic; using the deterring apparatus to compare the network traffic-related graphic with model-related graphics; using the deterring apparatus to determine whether the network traffic-related graphic matches any of the model-related graphics; using the deterring apparatus to provide a warning or block the packet of the inline network traffic if the network traffic-related graphic does not match any of the model-related graphics; and using the deterring apparatus to transfer the packet of the inline network traffic to the data center if the network traffic-related graphic matches any of the model-related graphics.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the step of providing a warning or blocking the packet of the inline network traffic comprises the step of writing data about the packet of the inline network traffic in a log file.
6. The method according to claim 4, wherein the step of comparing the network traffic-related graphic with the model-related graphic comprises the step of training to derive optimized model-related graphics from the model-related graphics and the network traffic-related graphic, and the optimized model-related graphics are to be used as model-related graphics with which a next network traffic-related graphic is to be compared.
7. An apparatus for deterring malicious network traffic heading for a data center from an external user via a cloud, the apparatus comprising at least one analyzer server connected to routers of the data center via a tap switch, wherein the analyzer server comprises: at least one bitmap converter for converting at least one packet of inline network traffic into a network traffic-related graphic; at least one model-storing unit for storing model-related graphics; and at least one graphics processing unit for comparing the network traffic-related graphic with the model-related graphic the graphic, providing a warning or blocking the packet of the inline network traffic at a first result of the comparison, and transferring the packet of the inline network traffic to the data center at a second result of the comparison.
8. The apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the model-related graphics stored in the model-storing unit are derived from malicious packets.
9. The apparatus according to claim 8, wherein the model-related graphics derived from the malicious packets are extracted from malicious patterns of the malicious packets.
10. The apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the model-related graphics stored in the model-storing unit are derived from normal packets.
11. The apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the analyzer server further comprises an artificial intelligence training unit connected to the graphics processing unit, and operable for deep training based on the model-related graphics to derive at least one model-related graphic from the model-related graphic.
