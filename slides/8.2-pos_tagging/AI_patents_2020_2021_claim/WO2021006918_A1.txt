DATA ANALYTICS SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROCESSING HEALTH INSURANCE CLAIMS AND TARGETED ADVERTISEMENT -BASED HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT
</title>

<abstract>
A blockchain-based program is provided to transform personal medical records, history and documentation of a participant to: seek appointments with medical practitioners; streamline flow of medical diagnostics; provide checks and balances to counteract improper medical exams, tests, over-prescription medication; and reward users with providing credit towards their healthcare bills and premiums for living a healthy and active life styles. Advertising content, paid for by a private-party advertiser, is provided to the participant to provide additional credit for consumption of the advertising content. Organ donation is coordinated immediately at least partially based on the transformed medical records of the blockchain-based program, as is facilitation of the participant to purchase medication. Organized and/or tracked shipment and a recycling program for the medication are also available. Ability to process and expedite with absolute transparency every single health insurance claim made by a citizen.

CLAIMS
1. A method comprising the steps of:
providing a blockchain-based program, stored in a non-transitory digital medium and at least partially executed by one or more processors of a computer-based system that transforms personal medical records, history and documentation of a participant of the blockchain-based program, wherein the blockchain-based program uses the transformed personal medical records to:
seek appointments with medical practitioners;
streamline flow of medical diagnostics;
provide checks and balances to counteract improper medical exams, tests, over prescription medication; and
reward users with providing credit towards their healthcare bills and premiums for living a healthy and active life styles;
providing advertising content, paid for by a private-party advertiser, to the participant to provide credit at least partially based on successful consumption of the advertising content as indicated by completion of a survey by the participant and return of same to the privateparty advertiser;
coordinating where an organ will be donated immediately at least partially based on the transformed medical records of the blockchain-based program;
facilitating the participant to purchase medication at least partially based on the blockchain-based program;
offering organized and/or tracked shipment of the medication at least partially based on the blockchain-based program; and
creating a recycling program for the medication that is unused at least partially based on the blockchain-based program to accordingly provide credit to the participant.
2. The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the transformation of the personal medical records includes any one or more selected from a group consisting of: tracking, analyzing, storing, and expediting.
3. The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the advertising content includes a digital platform for advertisements where the private party advertiser pays to advertise their products to specific target audiences with the survey at an end of each advertisement.
4. The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the blockchain-based program further uses the transformed personal medical records to"
provide a virtual personal health assistant ("VPHA")to combine voice automation and artificial intelligence to follow voice and/or text commands to provide information and assistance.
5. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium with an executable program stored thereon, wherein the program instructs one or more processors to perform the following steps: providing a blockchain-based program, stored in a non-transitory digital medium and at least partially executed by one or more processors of a computer-based system that transforms personal medical records, history and documentation of a participant of the blockchain-based program, wherein the blockchain-based program uses the transformed personal medical records to:
seek appointments with medical practitioners;
streamline flow of medical diagnostics;
provide checks and balances to counteract improper medical exams, tests, over prescription medication; and
reward users with providing credit towards their healthcare bills and premiums for living a healthy and active life styles;
providing advertising content, paid for by a private-party advertiser, to the participant to provide credit at least partially based on successful consumption of the advertising content as indicated by completion of a survey by the participant and return of same to the privateparty advertiser;
coordinating where an organ will be donated immediately at least partially based on the transformed medical records of the blockchain-based program;
facilitating the participant to purchase medication at least partially based on the blockchain-based program;
offering organized and/or tracked shipment of the medication at least partially based on the blockchain-based program; and creating a recycling program for the medication that is unused at least partially based on the blockchain-based program to accordingly provide credit to the participant.
6. The program instructing the one or more processors as recited in claim 1, further comprising a step of:
making medical diagnostics more accurate and accessible by using machine learning to predict what will happen within based on symptoms and genetics of the participant at least partially based on the transformed medical records of the blockchain-based program.
7. The program instructing the one or more processors as recited in claim 1, further comprising a step of:
making healthcare related cost information public to create competition within a healthcare industry.
8. A computing system, comprising:
at least one processor; and
at least one memory device including instructions embodied thereon, wherein the instructions, which when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform operations for processing of data in a medical evaluation workflow, the operations comprising:
providing a blockchain-based program, stored in a non-transitory digital medium and at least partially executed by one or more processors of a computer-based system that transforms personal medical records, history and documentation of a participant of the blockchain-based program, wherein the blockchain-based program uses the transformed personal medical records to:
seek appointments with medical practitioners;
streamline flow of medical diagnostics;
provide checks and balances to counteract improper medical exams, tests, over-prescription medication; and
reward users with providing credit towards their healthcare bills and premiums for living a healthy and active life styles;
providing advertising content, paid for by a private-party advertiser, to the participant to provide credit at least partially based on successful consumption of the advertising content as indicated by completion of a survey by the participant and return of same to the private-party advertiser; coordinating where an organ will be donated immediately at least partially based on the transformed medical records of the blockchain-based program; facilitating the participant to purchase medication at least partially based on the blockchain-based program;
offering organized and/or tracked shipment of the medication at least partially based on the blockchain-based program; and
creating a recycling program for the medication that is unused at least partially based on the blockchain-based program to accordingly provide credit to the participant.
9. The computing system of claim 8 wherein the processing of data in a medical evaluation workflow further comprises an operation of:
applying credit earned from the recycling program to medical needs.
10. The computing system of claim 8 wherein the processing of data in a medical evaluation workflow further comprises an operation of:
sharing medical records transformed by the blockchain-based program with government.
11. The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the blockchain-based program has the ability to process and expedite with absolute transparency every single health insurance claim made by a citizen into any doctor's office, specialist, hospital or medical facility (public or private) nationwide.
