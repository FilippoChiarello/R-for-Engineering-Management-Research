METHOD, SYSTEM AND NON-TRANSITORY COMPUTER-READABLE RECORDING MEDIUM FOR SUPPORTING LISTENING
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a method, system and non-transitory computer-readable recording medium for assisting listening study. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for assisting listening study, comprising the steps of: determining a plurality of weak study sentences that a user who is provided with assessment study sentences by speech fails to understand, with reference to feedback from the user; determining at least some of pronunciations or pronunciation combinations commonly included in the plurality of weak study sentences as weak pronunciations or pronunciation combinations that the user fails to understand; and determining a compensatory study course to be provided to the user, with reference to the determined weak pronunciations or pronunciation combinations.

<claims>
1. A method for assisting listening study, comprising the steps of: determining a plurality of weak study sentences that a user who is provided with assessment study sentences by speech fails to understand, with reference to feedback from the user; determining at least some of pronunciations or pronunciation combinations commonly included in the plurality of weak study sentences as weak pronunciations or pronunciation combinations that the user fails to understand; and determining a compensatory study course to be provided to the user, with reference to the determined weak pronunciations or pronunciation combinations.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein in the step of determining a plurality of weak study sentences, the plurality of weak study sentences are determined with further reference to feedback from the user who is provided with the assessment study sentences by speech and then by text again.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein in the step of determining a plurality of weak study sentences, each of the plurality of weak study sentences is structured by predetermined codes representing pronunciations or pronunciation combinations included in each of the plurality of weak study sentences.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein in the step of determining weak pronunciations or pronunciation combinations, pronunciations or pronunciation combinations that are commonly included in the plurality of weak study sentences at frequencies equal to or greater than a predetermined level are determined as the weak pronunciations or pronunciation combinations.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein in the step of determining a compensatory study course, a compensatory study material associated with the determined weak pronunciations or pronunciation combinations is determined.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the compensatory study material includes at least one of a single study material, an analogous study material, and a weakness prediction study material.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein in the step of determining a compensatory study course, the compensatory study course is specified by at least one compensatory study material associated with the weak pronunciations or pronunciation combinations, and a sequence in which the at least one compensatory study material is provided.
8. A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium having stored thereon a computer program for executing the method of claim 1.
9. A system for assisting listening study, comprising: a weak study sentence determination unit for determining a plurality of weak study sentences that a user who is provided with assessment study sentences by speech fails to understand, with reference to feedback from the user; a weak pronunciation determination unit for determining at least some of pronunciations or pronunciation combinations commonly included in the plurality of weak study sentences as weak pronunciations or pronunciation combinations that the user fails to understand; and a compensatory study course determination unit for determining a compensatory study course to be provided to the user, with reference to the determined weak pronunciations or pronunciation combinations.
