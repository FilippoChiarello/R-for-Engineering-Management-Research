AUTOMATED HEALTH STATE CLASSIFIER FOR ROTATING MACHINES BASED ON EXPERT KNOWLEDGE
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a computer-implemented method of, a data processing system for and a computer program product for indicating machine failures as well as to a corresponding machine and a computer-implemented method of training a neural network for indicating machine failures. At least one input signal based on at least one physical quantity of at least one machine part is transformed into at least one feature. A neural network predicts a class and/or a severity of at least one machine failure based on the at least one feature.
