MACHINE LEARNING DEVICE, CONTROL SYSTEM, AND MACHINE LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
Vibration of a machine end and an error of a moving trajectory are suppressed. A machine learning device performs machine learning of optimizing first coefficients of a filter provided in a motor controller that controls a motor and second coefficients of a velocity feedforward unit of a servo control unit provided in the motor controller on the basis of an evaluation function which is a function of measurement information after acceleration and deceleration by an external measuring instrument provided outside the motor controller, a position command input to the motor controller, and a position error which is a difference between the position command value and feedback position detection value from a detector of the servo control unit.
