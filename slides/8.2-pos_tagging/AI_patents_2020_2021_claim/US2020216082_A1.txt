SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MONITORING AND MANAGING COGNITIVE LOAD OF AN OCCUPANT OF A VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for monitoring and managing a cognitive load of an occupant of a vehicle, including: determining, based on analysis of a first set of sensory inputs received from a first set of sensors from a cabin of the vehicle, a current cognitive load score of an occupant of the vehicle; determining, based on an analysis of a second set of sensory inputs, a current state of the vehicle; analyzing the current cognitive load score of the occupant with respect to the current state of the vehicle; and, selecting at least one predetermined plan for execution based on a determination that a reduction of the current cognitive load score of the occupant is desirable, wherein the determination is based on a result of the analysis of the current cognitive load score of the occupant and the current state of the vehicle.

<claims>
1. A method for monitoring and managing a cognitive load of an occupant of a vehicle, comprising: determining, based on analysis of a first set of sensory inputs received from a first set of sensors from within a cabin of the vehicle, a current cognitive load score of at least one occupant of the vehicle; determining, based on an analysis of a second set of sensory inputs, a current state of the vehicle; analyzing the current cognitive load score of the at least one occupant of the vehicle with respect to the current state of the vehicle; and selecting at least one predetermined plan for execution when a reduction of the current cognitive load score of the at least one occupant is desirable, wherein the determination is based on a result of the analysis of the current cognitive load score of the at least one occupant and the current state of the vehicle.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the current state of the vehicle includes at least one of: a current state of an external environment of the vehicle and a current state of an internal environment of the vehicle.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the current state of the external environment of the vehicle is determined using at least one machine learning technique.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the analysis of the first set of sensory inputs further comprises at least one computer vision technique.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the determination of the current cognitive load score of the at least one occupant is achieved using at least one machine learning technique.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the at least one machine learning technique includes at least one of: one or more neural networks, recurrent neural networks, decision tree learning, Bayesian networks, and clustering.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the determination of the current cognitive load score of the at least one occupant further comprises: analyzing an interaction data between an agent of the vehicle and the at least one occupant.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the interaction data includes data relating to an upcoming interaction between the least one occupant of the vehicle and the agent.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the analysis of the second set of sensory inputs further comprises at least one computer vision technique.
10. A non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon instructions for causing a processing circuitry to perform a process, the process comprising: determining, based on analysis of a first set of sensory inputs received from a first set of sensors from within a cabin of a vehicle, a current cognitive load score of at least one occupant of the vehicle; determining, based on an analysis of a second set of sensory inputs, a current state of the vehicle; analyzing the current cognitive load score of the at least one occupant of the vehicle with respect to the current state of the vehicle; and, selecting at least one predetermined plan for execution when a reduction of the current cognitive load score of the at least one occupant is desirable, wherein the determination is based on a result of the analysis of the current cognitive load score of the at least one occupant and the current state of the vehicle.
11. A system for monitoring and managing a cognitive load of an occupant of a vehicle, comprising: a processing circuitry; and a memory, the memory containing instructions that, when executed by the processing circuitry, configure the system to: determine, based on analysis of a first set of sensory inputs received from a first set of sensors from within a cabin of the vehicle, a current cognitive load score of at least one occupant of the vehicle; determine, based on an analysis of a second set of sensory inputs, a current state of the vehicle; analyze the current cognitive load score of the at least one occupant of the vehicle with respect to the current state of the vehicle; and, select at least one predetermined plan for execution when a reduction of the current cognitive load score of the at least one occupant is desirable, wherein the determination is based on a result of the analysis of the current cognitive load score of the at least one occupant and the current state of the vehicle.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the current state of the vehicle includes at least one of: a current state of an external environment of the vehicle and a current state of an internal environment of the vehicle.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the current state of the external environment of the vehicle is determined using at least one machine learning technique.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the analysis of the first set of sensory inputs further comprises at least one computer vision technique.
15. The system of claim 11, wherein the determination of the current cognitive load score of the at least one occupant is achieved using at least one machine learning technique.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the at least one machine learning technique includes at least one of: one or more neural networks, recurrent neural networks, decision tree learning, Bayesian networks, and clustering.
17. The system of claim 11, wherein the system if further configured to: analyze an interaction data between an agent of the vehicle and the at least one occupant.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the interaction data includes data relating to an upcoming interaction between the least one occupant of the vehicle and the agent.
19. The system of claim 11, wherein the analysis of the second set of sensory inputs further comprises at least one computer vision technique.
