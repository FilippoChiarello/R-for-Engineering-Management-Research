SALIENCY-BASED VIDEO COMPRESSION SYSTEMS AND METHODS
</title>

<abstract>
Examples of systems and methods described herein may provide saliency-based video compression. A saliency map associated with a video may be generated and/or provided. A tile configuration may be selected for the video and quality settings assigned to each tile in accordance with the saliency map. The video may then be compressed (e.g., encoded) in tiles in accordance with the quality settings. Compressed videos may be stored together with saliency metadata, facilitating storage management and/or re-compression.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method comprising:
dividing a video segment spatially into tiles;
mapping each of the tiles to respective quality settings based on a saliency map associated with the video segment; and
encoding the tiles in accordance with the quality settings.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising generating the saliency map associated with the video segment by combining a plurality of intermediate saliency maps for each frame of the video segment.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein combining the plurality of intermediate saliency maps comprises collecting a maximum saliency for each pixel in the frame across the plurality of intermediate saliency maps.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising selecting a tiling configuration for the tiles, including:
compressing the tiles in accordance with multiple candidate tiling
configurations and the saliency map; and
evaluating metrics for the candidate tiling configurations.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the metrics comprise bitrate, video quality, or combinations thereof.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein said mapping comprises assigning a target bitrate or constant rate factor to selected tiles associated with a highest subset of saliency values in the saliency map.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein said mapping comprises assigning a minimum bitrate to a lowest subset of saliency values in the saliency map. 8. A method comprising:
chunking a video file into video segments;
compressing the video segments to provide video containers; and
including saliency metadata in each of the video containers.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein said saliency metadata comprises a tile
configuration for a video segment and a saliency weight for each tile in the tile configuration.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the tile configuration comprises a number of rows and columns in each of a plurality of tiles in the tile configuration.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein compressing the video segments comprises compressing the video segments in accordance with respective saliency maps and an association between quality settings and the saliency metadata.
12. The method of claim 11 , further comprising re-compressing the video segments using a different association between the quality settings and the saliency metadata.
13. The method of claim 8, further comprising updating the saliency map based on received perceptual information.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein said updating comprises calculating a weighted average of the saliency map and a new saliency map based on the received perceptual information.
15. A system comprising:
at least one processor;
at least one computer readable media encoded with instructions, which, when executed, cause the at least one processor to perform operations comprising:
generate a saliency map based on an input video segment; and associate quality settings with tiles of a video frame in accordance with the saliency map; and
a transcoder configured to transcode the input video segment in the tiles in accordance with the quality settings to provide a compressed video segment.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the operations further comprise select a tiling configuration from a set of candidate tiling configurations based on performance metrics associated with the set of candidate tiling configurations.
17. The system of claim 15, wherein the operations further comprise store the compressed video segment in a video container including saliency metadata comprising a saliency weight for each of the tiles.
18. The system of claim 15, wherein the saliency map comprises a combination of intermediate saliency maps for each frame in the video segment.
19. The system of claim 15, wherein the operations further comprise:
receive a request to reduce a size of the compressed video segment; and alter the quality settings responsive to the request to provide updated quality settings; and
wherein the transcoder is further configured to re-transcode the video segment in accordance with the updated quality settings.
20. The system of claim 15, wherein the operations further comprise:
receive additional perceptual information; and
update the saliency map based on the additional perceptual information to provide an updated saliency map.
21. The system of claim 15, wherein the system comprises a cloud-based service configured to receive the input video from an external source.
