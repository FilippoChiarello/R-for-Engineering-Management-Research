<title>
CONSENT-BASED DATA MANAGEMENT
</title>

<abstract>
An example operation may include one or more of generating, by a data management node, a profile token based on a data profile of a data provider (DP) node, receiving, by the data management node, a transaction request from a service provider (SP) node to access data from the DP node over a blockchain, acquiring, by the data management node, consent of the SP node based on the profile token, generating, by the data management node, a consent token based the consent of the SP node, and allowing access to data of the DP node by the SP node based on a verification of the consent token.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system, comprising: a processor of a data management node; a memory on which are stored machine readable instructions that when executed by the processor, cause the processor to: generate a profile token based on a data profile of a data provider (DP) node; receive a transaction request from a service provider (SP) node to access data from the DP node over a blockchain; acquire consent of the SP node based on the profile token; generate a consent token based the consent of the SP node; and allow access to data of the DP node by the SP node based on a verification of the consent token.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to maintain a verifiable record of consent for the SP node to access the data from the DP node.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to execute the requested transaction if the verifiable record of the consent exists on the blockchain.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the verifiable record of the consent is based on a zero-knowledge proof.
5. The system of claim 2, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to revoke the verifiable record of the consent on the blockchain, wherein identities of consented parties are not discoverable from the verifiable record of the consent.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to allow access to the data of the DP node by the SP node, wherein an identity of the DP node is not discoverable.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to verify the consent token in a distributed manner based on consensus protocols.
8. A method, comprising: generating, by a data management node, a profile token based on a data profile of a data provider (DP) node; receiving, by the data management node, a transaction request from a service provider (SP) node to access data from the DP node over a blockchain; acquiring, by the data management node, consent of the SP node based on the profile token; generating, by the data management node, a consent token based the consent of the SP node; and allowing access to data of the DP node by the SP node based on a verification of the consent token.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising maintaining a verifiable record of consent for the SP node to access the data from the DP node.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising executing the requested transaction if the verifiable record of the consent exists on the blockchain.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the verifiable record of the consent is based on a zero-knowledge proof.
12. The method of claim 9, further comprising revoking the verifiable record of the consent on the blockchain, wherein identities of consented parties are not discoverable from the verifiable record of the consent.
13. The method of claim 8, further comprising allowing access to the data from the DP node by the SP node, wherein an identity of the DP node is not discoverable.
14. The method of claim 8, further comprising verifying the consent token in a distributed manner based on consensus protocols.
15. A non-transitory computer readable medium comprising instructions, that when read by a processor, cause the processor to perform: generating a profile token based on a data profile of a data provider (DP) node; receiving a transaction request from a service provider (SP) node to access data from the DP node over a blockchain; acquiring consent of the SP node based on the profile token; generating a consent token based the consent of the SP node; and allowing access to data of the DP node by the SP node based on a verification of the consent token.
16. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, further comprising instructions, that when read by the processor, cause the processor to maintain a verifiable record of consent for the SP node to access the data from the DP node.
17. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, further comprising instructions, that when read by the processor, cause the processor to execute the requested transaction if the verifiable record of the consent exists on the blockchain.
18. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 17, wherein the verifiable record of the consent is based on a zero-knowledge proof.
19. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, further comprising instructions, that when read by the processor, cause the processor to revoke the verifiable record of the consent on the blockchain, wherein identities of consented parties are not discoverable from the verifiable record of the consent.
20. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, further comprising instructions, that when read by the processor, cause the processor to allow access to the data from the DP node by the SP node, wherein an identity of the DP node is not discoverable.
