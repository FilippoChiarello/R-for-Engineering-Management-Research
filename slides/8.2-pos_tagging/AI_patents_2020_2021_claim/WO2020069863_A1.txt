SYSTEM FOR DATA COMMUNICATION IN A NETWORK OF LOCAL DEVICES
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a system (100) for data communication in a network between two or more local devices (110, 120, 130) and a cloud computing platform (150), in which data collected and/or stored on at least one local device (110) are transmitted to a cloud computing platform (150) using at least one communication protocol (a1, a2,..., an) and processed by a translation algorithm (A) executed in a translator module (170) of the cloud computing platform (150), wherein the data are transferred to at least one another communication protocol (b1, b2,..., bn) which is processable or executable by at least one second local device (120) and submitted to the at least one second device (120).

Patent Claims
1. A system (100) for data communication in a network between two or more local devices (110, 120, 130) and a cloud computing platform (150), in which data collected and/or stored on at least one local device (110) are transmitted to the cloud computing platform (150) using at least one
communication protocol (ai, a2,..., an) and processed in a translator module (170) of the cloud computing platform
(150), wherein the data are transformed to at least one other communication protocol (bi, b2, ..., bn) which is processable by at least one second local device (120) and submitted to the at least one second local device (120) .
2. The system (100) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the local devices (110, 120, 130) and the cloud computing
platform (120) are connected by a gateway (140) which is configured to transmit the data from the at least first local device (110) with the first communication protocol (ai, a2,..., an) to the cloud computing platform (120) and to submit the data with the second communication protocol (bi, b2, ..., bn) from the cloud computing platform (150) to the at least one second local device (120).
3. The system (100) as claimed in claims 1 or 2, wherein a translation algorithm (A) used by the translator module (170) to process the data comprises sub-algorithms (SA1, SA2, ...
SAn) which are executable in a serial and/or parallel
sequence .
4. The system (100) as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein a workflow regarding the sequence and the location of the execution of the sub-algorithms (SA1, SA2, ... SAn) is controlled by a software application.
5. The system (100) as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the translation algorithm (A) is configured as a clustering and/or an artificial neural network and/or a Support Vector Machine and/or is subdivided into sub
algorithms (SA1, SA2,... San) .
6. The system (100) as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the processed data are collected from vibration sensors and/or acoustical sensors and/or optical sensors and/or temperature sensors and/or pressure sensors and/or chemical and/or piezoelectric sensors.
7. The system (100) as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein a plurality of local devices (110, 120, 130) is connected in the network.
8. The system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the two or more local devices (110, 120,130) are configured as an industrial pump, a medical device, an image device, mobile device, an automotive device and/or an
analytical scientific instrument.
9. A method for data communication in a network between two or more local devices (110, 120, 130) and a cloud computing platform (150), comprising the steps of: collecting and/or storing data (S10) on at least one local device (110) ,
transmitting (S20) the data to a cloud computing platform (150) using at least one communication protocol (ai, a2,...,
9n ) r
processing (S30) the data by a translator module (170) of the cloud computing platform (150), wherein the data are transformed to at least one another communication protocol (bi, b2, .路路, bn) which is processable by at least one second local device (120), and
submitting (S40) the data with the other communication protocol (bi, b2, ..., bn) to the at least one second device (120) .
10. The method as claimed in claim 9, comprising the steps of :
- connecting the local devices (110, 120, 130) and the cloud computing platform (120) by a gateway (170),
- transmitting the data from the at least one first local device (110) with the first communication protocol (ai, a2,..., an) to the cloud computing platform (120) by the gateway ( 170 ) ;
- submitting the data with the second communication protocol (bi, b2, .路路, bn) from the cloud computing platform (150) to the at least one second local device (120) by the gateway (170.
11. A local device (110, 120, 130) configured for a system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the two or more local devices (110, 120, 130) is configured as an industrial pump, a medical device, an image device, mobile device, an automotive device and/or an analytical scientific instrument .
12. A cloud computing platform (150) configured for use in the system (100) as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8.
13. A non-transient computer-readable data storage medium (300) comprising executable program code (350) configured to, when executed, perform the method according to claim 8 or 9.
