<title>
Vehicle classification system
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle bears labels describing handling characteristics of the vehicle for the benefit of autonomous vehicles in proximity to the vehicle. The labels may be nonvisible, such as through use of UV or IR inks. The labels may be present such that they are visible regardless of view direction and may be affixed using a vehicle wrap applied to panels of the vehicle. Autonomous vehicles detect the labels and retrieve handling characteristics from a local database or a remote server. The autonomous vehicles are therefore relieved from the processing required to predict or infer the handling characteristics of the vehicle.

<claims>
1. A vehicle comprising: a vehicle body; a power source, wheels, and a drive train; and a covering on the outside of the vehicle body having a plurality of encoded labels distributed over front, rear, left, and right sides of the vehicle body, the encoded labels encoding data describing a handling characteristic of the vehicle.
2. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the covering is a wrap covering a plurality of panels of the body.
3. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the handling characteristic of the vehicle is a classification of the vehicle.
4. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the handling characteristic of the vehicle is a usage of the vehicle.
5. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the encoded labels are non-visible to a human eye.
6. The vehicle of claim 5, wherein the encoded labels are only visible at wavelengths larger than 700 nanometers.
7. The vehicle of claim 5, wherein the encoded labels are only visible at wavelengths smaller than 400 nanometers.
8. A method comprising: receiving, by a vehicle controller of a first vehicle, sensor data from exterior sensors mounted to the first vehicle, the exterior sensors including a camera; evaluating, by the vehicle controller, an image included in the sensor data; identifying, by the vehicle controller, a second vehicle having an encoded label in the image; decoding, by the vehicle controller, the encoded label to obtain a handling characteristic of the second vehicle; and performing obstacle avoidance with respect to the second vehicle based on the sensor data and the handling characteristic.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the sensor data includes outputs from at least one of a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor and a radio detection and ranging (RADAR) sensor.
10. The method of claim 8, further comprising capturing the image by the camera by detecting light with wavelengths not visible to a human eye.
11. The method of claim 8, further comprising capturing the image by the camera by detecting wavelengths larger than 700 nanometers.
12. The method of claim 8, further capturing the image by the camera by detecting wavelengths smaller than 400 nanometers.
13. The method of claim 8, wherein decoding the encoded label comprises: extracting, by the vehicle controller, an identifier from the encoded label; transmitting, by the vehicle controller, the identifier to a remote server; and receiving, by the vehicle controller, the handling characteristic from the remote server.
14. The method of claim 8, wherein decoding the encoded label comprises: extracting, by the vehicle controller, an identifier from the encoded label; retrieving, by the vehicle controller, the handling characteristic from an entry in a database stored in the vehicle, the entry corresponding to the identifier.
15. The method of claim 8, wherein the handling characteristic of the vehicle is a classification of the vehicle.
16. The method of claim 8, wherein the handling characteristic of the vehicle is a usage of the vehicle.
17. A method comprising: providing a vehicle including a plurality of body panels, a power source, wheels, and a drive train; encoding a handling characteristic of the vehicle in a label; and applying a wrap to the plurality of body panels such that the wrap completely covers the plurality of body panels, the wrap having copies of the label distributed throughout the wrap such that copies of the label are located on front, rear, left, and right sides of the vehicle body, the encoded labels encoding data describing a handling characteristic of the vehicle.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the handling characteristic includes at least one of a classification and usage of the vehicle.
19. The method of claim 17, wherein the copies of the label are only visible at wavelengths larger than 700 nanometers.
20. The method of claim 17, wherein the copies of the label are only visible at wavelengths smaller than 400 nanometers.
