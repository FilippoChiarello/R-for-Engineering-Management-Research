<title>
Evaluating system behaviour
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides a method, system and non-transient computer readable medium for evaluating system behaviour by deriving a statistical distance between each entity in a multi-entity system, and summing the statistical distance to each other entity to create a ranked abnormality score for each entity in the system.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of evaluating system behaviour, comprising: for each entity in a multi-entity system, deriving an empirical probability distribution for a feature, calculating a pair-wise statistical distance between each entity in the system for the feature, for each entity, summing the statistical distances to each other entity to create a ranked abnormality score for each entity in the system, and applying an upper bound to the statistical distance for the feature between any two entities in the system, such that the upper bound is equal to log((1/{tilde over (∈)})+N), wherein {tilde over (∈)} is equal to 1/SMAX, wherein SMAX is the maximum number of events in any probability distribution for that feature across all entities, and N is the cardinality of the probability distribution for the feature.
2. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: deriving an empirical probability distribution for multiple features for each entity in the multi-entry system, calculating a pair-wise statistical distance between each entity in the system for each feature of the multiple features, for each feature of the multiple feature, summing the statistical distances to each other entity to create a ranked abnormality score for each entity in the system, and for each entity, summing the cumulative statistical distance to each other entity across each of the multiple features to create a ranked abnormality score for each entity in the system across the multiple features.
3. The method according to claim 2, further comprising: weighting the pair-wise statistical distance values for a chosen feature in order to provide a weighted sum across all features for each entity.
4. The method according to claim 2, wherein the features are weighted automatically to increase contribution of probability distributions from rarer features.
5. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: weighting individual event results within the empirical probability distribution for the feature.
6. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: normalizing each probability distribution for the feature to be non-zero.
7. The method according to claim 6, further comprising: achieving the normalization by adding a non-zero constant {tilde over (∈)} to each original empirical probability value, wherein the non-zero constant {tilde over (∈)} is 1/SMAX, and SMAX is the maximum number of events in any probability distribution for the feature across all entities, and further normalizing the probability distribution over N so that all probabilities sum to 1, wherein N is the cardinality of the probability distribution for the feature.
8. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: utilizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure to calculate the statistical distance.
9. The method of claim 1, comprising: after carrying out an initial round of statistical distance calculations from a single entity to all other entities, clustering the entities according to the initial statistical distance calculated between one entity to each other entity for the feature, calculating further feature statistical distances between entity members of the same cluster only, and calculating inter-cluster statistical distances between cluster representatives only.
10. The method according to claim 9, further comprising: pre-clustering the probability distributions into delta and non-delta clusters.
11. An anomaly detection system comprising: a probability engine to derive the empirical event probability distribution for each individual electronic device on a network comprising multiple electronic devices for a plurality of features; a distance calculator to calculate, for each feature of the plurality of features, pair-wise statistical distances between each derived probability distribution; and an abnormality rank generator to combine, for each electronic device across each feature of the plurality of features, the statistical distances to each other electronic devices on the network, and output a ranking value based upon the measure of dissimilarity between the empirical event probability distribution data for each device on the network, wherein the ranking value is across all features.
12. The system according to claim 11, wherein: the distance calculator is limited to a maximum value Dmax for any statistical distance calculated.
13. A non-transitory machine readable storage medium comprising instructions which, when loaded into memory and executed by at least one processor of an anomaly detection system, cause the processor to: for each computer device in a multi-device system, obtain event data comprising time-stamped data records, said data records comprising at least one data field value relating to a measurement of the computer device; compute an empirical probability distribution for the at least one data field for each computer device, normalize each empirical probability distribution to be non-zero, wherein the normalization comprises: adding a non-zero constant {tilde over (∈)} to each empirical probability distribution value, wherein the non-zero constant {tilde over (∈)} is 1/SMAX, and SMAX is the maximum number of events in any probability distribution for the data field value across all entities, and normalizing the probability distribution over N so that all probabilities sum to 1, wherein N is the cardinality of the probability distribution for the data field, calculate a pair-wise statistical distance between each computer device in the multi-device system for that data field, and for each computer device, sum a one-way statistical distance from that computer device to each other computer device, to create a ranked abnormality score for each computer device in the multi-device system, whereby the summed statistical distance to each other computer device from a particular computer device indicates any abnormal functioning of that computer device within the multi-device system.
