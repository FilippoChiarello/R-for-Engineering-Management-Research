SYSTEMS, METHODS AND APPARATUSES FOR IDENTITY ACCESS MANAGEMENT AND WEB SERVICES ACCESS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods, and apparatus for identity access management for web services are disclosed. The method includes: creating on a user device, a session's access token and an identity token to be sent along with a request for accessing web services, wherein: the accessing of web services includes at least one of: retrieving and pushing information from an instance storage which is client specific and protected from unauthorized access by another instance storage; the session's access token indicates a location where the session's access token was created, an expiration time, and a hash identity for verifying a validity of the session's access token; the identity token identifies a user who sends the request; and authenticating the user on the user device according to the session's access token and the identity token to authorize the accessing of web services in a session.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of identity access management for web services, comprising: creating on a user device, a session's access token and an identity token to be sent along with a request for accessing web services, wherein: the accessing of web services comprising at least one of: retrieving and pushing information from an instance storage which is client specific and protected from unauthorized access by another instance storage; the session's access token indicates a location where the session's access token was created, an expiration time, and a hash identity for verifying a validity of the session's access token; the identity token identifies a user who sends the request; and authenticating the user on the user device according to the session's access token and the identity token to authorize the accessing of web services in a session.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the accessing of web services comprising: enabling the user to retrieve or push the information from the instance storage utilizing a blockchain into a distributed and immutable format.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the authenticating comprising validating, authenticating and/or revoking multi-factor credentials and the multi-factor credentials comprises one or more inputs of: password, fingerprint, facial biometrics, voice, geolocation and tokens.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the request to access web services further comprising: carrying out tasks and routing traffics through a service layer; retrieving and pushing information from the instance storage through a data layer; and analyzing performance of the user and evaluating ease of deployment of a service application in the user device within an existing application in a system remote from the user device through an analysis layer.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the traffic routing in the service layer comprising performing at least two of: training a chatbot to learn unique jargon to interact with the user to assist in document search from the instance storage; tracking certification service routes between distributed ledger and application database for validity of user's credentials certification; providing a pointer location to route a content service to a file indexed application database; routing the user to access a most recent event-driven data and activity-driven data generated by the user as a file entry point according to a service log; attaching geolocations data to information being pushed or retrieved from the instance storage; capturing and analyzing image and vides files through an object classification pipeline of a media service; managing notes taken on the user device and attaching images, videos and geolocations to the notes; routing traffics through respective hosted elasticsearch instance services; managing user' specific configurations for consistent experience across multiple devices through a settings service.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein the data layer further comprising: a data warehouse to aggregate user level data from the user device into a data warehouse; an application database to store user accessible data; a distributed ledger to distribute the retrieved or pushed information through the blockchain that is external to the instance storage; the instance storage to update and store the information into one or both of public files and user's files; and a connected storage to access files from one or more third-party file storage providers.
7. The method of claim 4, wherein the analysis layer comprises: a certification pipeline to automate provisioning of certification and credentials of the user in a progress pipeline for the analysis of the user's performance and the evaluation of ease of deployment of the service application in the user device within the existing application in the system; a document analysis pipeline to analyze new and update documents introduced to the ecosystem through the instance storage and/or connected storage. an object classification pipeline to create instance customized machine learning models to train viewers; and a user profile pipeline to analyze user event data written to a data warehouse through events service.
8. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing program codes, when executed by a processor of a user device, configures the user device to perform operations of identity access management for web services, the operations comprising: creating on a user device, a session's access token and an identity token to be sent along with a request for accessing web services, wherein: the accessing of web services comprising at least one of: retrieving and pushing information from an instance storage which is client specific and protected from unauthorized access by another instance storage; the session's access token indicates a location where the session's access token was created, an expiration time, and a hash identity for verifying a validity of the session's access token; the identity token identifies a user who sends the request; and authenticating the user on the user device according to the session's access token and the identity token to authorize the accessing of web services in a session.
9. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein the accessing of web services comprising: enabling the user to retrieve or push the information from the instance storage utilizing a blockchain into a distributed and immutable format.
10. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein the authenticating comprising validating, authenticating and/or revoking multi-factor credentials and the multi-factor credentials comprises one or more inputs of: password, fingerprint, facial biometrics, voice, geolocation and tokens.
11. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 9, wherein the request to access web services further comprising: carrying out tasks and routing traffics through a service layer; retrieving and pushing information from the instance storage through a data layer; and analyzing performance of the user and evaluating ease of deployment of a service application in the user device within an existing application in a system remote from the user device through an analysis layer.
12. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 11, wherein the traffic routing in the service layer comprising performing at least two of: training a chatbot to learn unique jargon to interact with the user to assist in document search from the instance storage; tracking certification service routes between distributed ledger and application database for validity of user's credentials certification; providing a pointer location to route a content service to a file indexed application database; routing the user to access a most recent event-driven data and activity-driven data generated by the user as a file entry point according to a service log; attaching geolocations data to information being pushed or retrieved from the instance storage; capturing and analyzing image and vides files through an object classification pipeline of a media service; managing notes taken on the user device and attaching images, videos and geolocations to the notes; routing traffics through respective hosted elasticsearch instance services; managing user' specific configurations for consistent experience across multiple devices through a settings service.
13. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 11, wherein the data layer further comprising: a data warehouse to aggregate user level data from the user device into a data warehouse; an application database to store user accessible data; a distributed ledger to distribute the retrieved or pushed information through the blockchain that is external to the instance storage; the instance storage to update and store the information into one or both of public files and user's files; and a connected storage to access files from one or more third-party file storage providers.
