<abstract>
An information processing apparatus includes an estimation unit configured to estimate, based on a feature of a person of interest contained in an image captured in each of a plurality of regions and a feature of a previously set registered person, a certainty that the person of interest is the registered person, and an updating unit configured to, with respect to a first person of interest subjected to image capturing in a first region out of the plurality of regions, in a case where a period for which a state in which a certainty that a second person of interest contained in an image captured in a second region different from the first region is the registered person is larger than a threshold value is kept is longer than a predetermined period, perform updating in such a way as to lower a certainty that the first person of interest in the first region is the registered person, and, in a case where the period for which the state in which the certainty that the second person of interest is the registered person is larger than the threshold value is kept is shorter than the predetermined period, perform updating in such a way as not to lower the certainty that the first person of interest in the first region is the registered person.
