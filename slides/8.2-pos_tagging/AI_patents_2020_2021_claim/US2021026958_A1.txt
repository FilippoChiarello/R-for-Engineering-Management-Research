SYSTEM FOR ADAPTIVE VEHICLE SECURITY AND RESPONSE
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle computer system includes one or more sensors configured to receive input regarding a vehicle's environment, and a controller in communication with the one or more sensors of the vehicle. The controller is configured to identify a cyber-attack on one or more vehicle controllers in the vehicle, and respond to the cyber-attack based upon at least the vehicle environment.

<claims>
1. A vehicle computer system, comprising: one or more sensors configured to receive input regarding a vehicle's environment; and a controller in communication with the one or more sensors of a vehicle, wherein the controller is configured to: identify a cyber-attack on one or more vehicle controllers in the vehicle; and respond to the cyber-attack based upon at least the vehicle environment.
2. The vehicle computer system of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to send instructions to one or more vehicle controllers to slow a speed of travel of the vehicle in response to the input regarding the vehicle's environment indicating the vehicle exceeds a threshold speed during the cyber-attack.
3. The vehicle computer system of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to reboot one or more vehicle controllers or processes in response to the cyber-attack on one or more vehicle controllers configured to control one or more driving functions of the vehicle.
4. The vehicle computer system of claim 1, wherein the one or more sensors includes a global position system (GPS) sensor configured to identify a geographic location of the vehicle and the controller is configured to either activate a cyber response in response to the geographic location of the vehicle.
5. The vehicle computer system of claim 4, wherein the geographic location of the vehicle is associated with a point of interest (POI) of the vehicle and the controller is configured to activate the cyber response in response to the POI.
6. The vehicle computer system of claim 4, wherein the geographic location of the vehicle is associated with a work location of the vehicle and the controller is configured to activate the cyber response in response to the work location.
7. The vehicle computer system of claim 1, wherein the one or more vehicle controllers are configured to provide memory map information to the controller in response to the cyber-attack.
8. The vehicle computer system of claim 1, wherein the one or more vehicle controllers are configured to provide memory register information to the controller in response to the cyber-attack.
9. The vehicle computer system of claim 1, wherein the one or more vehicle controllers are configured to provide memory trace information to the controller in response to the cyber-attack.
10. A vehicle computer system, comprising: one or more sensors configured to receive input regarding a vehicle's environment; and a controller in communication with the one or more sensors, wherein the controller is configured to: identify a vehicle security protocol, including parameters to activate or deactivate vehicle controllers configured to communicate with external devices, in response to the input regarding the vehicle's environment; and execute the vehicle security protocol.
11. The vehicle computer system of claim 10, wherein the controller is further configured to determine that the vehicle computer system is not under a cyber-attack.
12. The vehicle computer system of claim 10, wherein the vehicle security protocol includes parameters to deactivate one or more Bluetooth controllers.
13. The vehicle computer system of claim 10, wherein the vehicle security protocol includes parameters to deactivate one or more Wi-Fi controllers.
14. The vehicle computer system of claim 10, wherein the vehicle security protocol includes parameters to activate one or more Wi-Fi controllers in response to one or more sensors receiving input regarding a vehicle's location at a point of interest location.
15. The vehicle computer system of claim 10, wherein the vehicle security protocol includes parameters to deactivate one or more sensors.
16. A vehicle computer system, comprising: one or more sensors configured to receive input regarding a vehicle's environment; and a security controller in communication with the one or more sensors, wherein the security controller is configured to: identify a cyber-attack on one or more vehicle controllers in the vehicle; respond to the cyber-attack based upon at least the vehicle environment; determine a vehicle security protocol to activate, including parameters to activate or deactivate vehicle controllers configured to communicate with external devices, in response to the input regarding the vehicle's environment; and activate the vehicle security protocol.
17. The vehicle computer system of claim 16, wherein vehicle security protocol is configured to reboot the one or more vehicle controllers.
18. The vehicle computer system of claim 16, wherein the security controller is further configured to reboot the vehicle computer system in response to the input regarding the vehicle's environment being below a safety threshold.
19. The vehicle computer system of claim 16, wherein vehicle security protocol is configured to stop operation of one or more vehicle controllers in response to the input regarding the vehicle's environment exceeds a safety threshold.
20. The vehicle computer system of claim 16, wherein the security controller is further configured to provide memory information to the security controller in response to the cyber-attack.
