<title>
EVALUATING TEXT CLASSIFICATION ANOMALIES PREDICTED BY A TEXT CLASSIFICATION MODEL
</title>

<abstract>
In response to running at least one testing phrase on a previously trained text classifier and identifying a separate predicted classification label based on a score calculated for each respective at least one testing phrase, a text classifier decomposes extracted features summed in the score into word-level scores for each word in the at least one testing phrase. The text classifier assigns a separate heatmap value to each of the word-level scores, each respective separate heatmap value reflecting a weight of each word-level score. The text classifier outputs the separate predicted classification label and each separate heatmap value reflecting the weight of each word-level score for defining a heatmap identifying the contribution of each word in the at least one testing phrase to the separate predicted classification label for facilitating client evaluation of text classification anomalies.
