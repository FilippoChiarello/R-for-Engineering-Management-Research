</title>

<abstract>
A method of controlling a robot arm with robot joints, where the joint motors of the joints are controlled based on a signal generated based on the friction torque (formula I) of at least one of the input/outside of the robot joint transmission and the robot joint transmission torque (formula II) between the input side and the output side of the transmission. The friction torque is determined based on: at least two of the angular position of the motor axle; the angular position of the output axle and/or the motor torque provided to the motor axle by the joint motor. The robot joint transmission torque is determined based on : at least one of the angular position of the output axle; the angular position of the output axle and/or the angular position of the motor axle; the angular position of the motor axle and the motor torque provided to the motor axle by the joint motor.
