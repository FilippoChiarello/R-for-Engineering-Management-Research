<title>
Computer system and method for handling non-communicative assets
</title>

<abstract>
The example systems, methods, and devices disclosed herein generally relate to handling operating data from non-communicative assets. In some instances, a data-analytics platform receives operating data points from a given asset of a plurality of assets. Based on that data, the data-analytics platform detects a communication abnormality at the given asset, in accordance with one or more techniques disclosed herein. In response to detecting the communication abnormality, the data-analytics platform designates the given asset as being non-communicative. The data-analytics platform handles operating data points received from the given asset in accordance with the non-communicative designation.
