CONTEXTUAL BIOMETRIC LOGGING SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
In an example implementation according to aspects of the present disclosure, a method may receive a biometric datum from a biometric sensor at a normal frequency interval, determine a relationship between the biometric datum and a predetermined threshold based on context which the datum was collected, activate a logging device when the predetermined threshold is surpassed and transmit a notification to a third-party system in the event of an emergency.

<claims>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A system comprising:
a biometric sensor;
a controller, communicatively coupled to the biometric sensor, to:
receive a biometric datum from the biometric sensor at a normal frequency interval;
determine a relationship between the biometric datum and a predetermined threshold, wherein the relationship is based at least in part on a context;
activate, responsive to the determining, a logging device.
2. The system of claim 1 wherein the context comprises a geographic location.
3. The system of claim 2 wherein the relationship comprises a comparison between the biometric datum and a predetermined threshold.
4. The system of claim 1 wherein the logging device receives a set of biometric data sampled at a higher frequency interval than the normal frequency interval.
5. The system of claim 1 wherein the logging device transmits the set of
biometric data to a cloud-based retrieval system.
6. A method comprising:
receiving a biometric datum from a biometric sensor at a normal frequency interval;
determining a relationship between the biometric datum and a predetermined threshold, wherein the relationship is based at least in part on a context;
activating, responsive to the determining, a logging device; and transmitting a notification to a third-party system.
7. The method of claim 6 wherein the context comprises a geographic location.
8. The method of claim 7 wherein the relationship comprises a comparison between the biometric datum and a predetermined threshold.
9. The method of claim 6 wherein the logging device receives a set of biometric data sampled at a higher frequency interval than the normal frequency interval.
10. The method of claim 6 wherein the logging device transmits the set of
biometric data to a cloud-based retrieval system.
1 1. A computing device comprising:
a memory having instructions stored thereon and
a processor configured to perform, when executing the instructions to:
receive a biometric datum from a biometric sensor at a normal frequency interval;
determine a relationship between the biometric datum and a predetermined threshold, wherein the relationship is based at least in part on a geographic location of the biometric sensor;
activate, responsive to the determining, a logging device wherein the logging device requests a set of biometric data sampled at a higher frequency interval than the normal frequency interval from the biometric sensor.
12. The computing device of claim 1 1 wherein the relationship further comprises a time.
13. The computing device of claim 12 wherein the predetermined threshold
comprises a historical comparison of a historical biometric datum within the geographic location of the biometric sensor.
14. The computing device of claim 1 1 wherein the logging device receives a set of biometric data sampled at a higher frequency interval than the normal frequency interval.
15. The computing device of claim 1 1 wherein the logging device transmits the set of biometric data to a cloud-based retrieval system.
