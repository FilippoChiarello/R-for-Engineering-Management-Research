<claims>
1. A display panel comprising: a first region, a second region, and a display region, wherein the first region comprises part of the display region, wherein the second region comprises another part of the display region, wherein the second region is provided with a first component, wherein the second region is capable of being bent with the first component facing outward, wherein the first component comprises a first elastic body and a second elastic body, wherein the second elastic body comprises an end portion part or the whole of which is covered with the first elastic body, and wherein the second elastic body has a higher elastic modulus than the first elastic body.
2. The display panel according to claim 1, wherein the display region has a function of performing display in a direction in which the first component is not provided.
3. The display panel according to claim 1, wherein the second region is capable of being bent with a curvature radius larger than 2 mm.
4. The display panel according to claim 1, wherein a thickness of the second region is smaller than a thickness obtained by addition of 100 Î¼m to a thickness of the first component.
5. The display panel according to claim 1, wherein the first component becomes thinner toward end portions in a cross section.
6. The display panel according to claim 1, wherein the first component has a belt-like shape to cross the display region.
7. The display panel according to claim 1, further comprising: a sealant, a first base, a second base, and a third region, wherein the sealant is positioned between the first base and the second base, wherein the second base comprises a region overlapping with the first base, wherein the first region comprises part of the overlapping region, wherein the second region comprises another part of the overlapping region, wherein the third region comprises the overlapping region, an end portion of the first base, the second base, and a second component, wherein the second component covers the end portion of the first base, and wherein the second component has lower moisture permeability than the sealant.
8. The display panel according to claim 1, further comprising: a pixel, wherein the pixel comprises a functional layer and a display element, wherein the functional layer comprises a pixel circuit, and wherein the pixel circuit is electrically connected to the display element.
9. The display panel according to claim 1, wherein the display region comprises a group of pixels, a different group of pixels, a scan line, and a signal line, wherein the group of pixels comprise the pixel, wherein the group of pixels are provided in a row direction, wherein the different group of pixels comprise the pixel, wherein the different group of pixels are provided in a column direction intersecting the row direction, wherein the scan line is electrically connected to the group of pixels, and wherein the signal line is electrically connected to the different group of pixels.
10. A display device comprising: the display panel according to claim 1 and a control portion, wherein the control portion is supplied with image data and control data, wherein the control portion generates data on the basis of the image data, wherein the control portion generates a control signal on the basis of the control data, wherein the control portion supplies the data and the control signal, wherein the display panel is supplied with the data or the control signal, and wherein the pixel performs display on the basis of the data.
11. An input/output device comprising: an input portion and a display portion, wherein the display portion comprises the display panel according to claim 1, wherein the input portion comprises a sensing region, wherein the input portion senses an object approaching the sensing region, and wherein the sensing region comprises a region overlapping with the pixel.
12. A data processing device comprising: an arithmetic device and an input/output device, wherein the arithmetic device is supplied with input data or sensing data, wherein the arithmetic device supplies control data and image data, wherein the input/output device supplies the input data and the sensing data, wherein the input/output device is supplied with the control data and the image data, wherein the input/output device comprises a display portion, an input portion, and a sensing portion, wherein the display portion comprises the display panel according to claim 1, wherein the display portion displays the image data on the basis of the control data, wherein the input portion generates the input data, and wherein the sensing portion generates the sensing data.
13. A data processing device comprising: one or more of a keyboard, a hardware button, a pointing device, a touch sensor, an illuminance sensor, an imaging device, an audio input device, an eye-gaze input device, and an attitude sensing device, and the display panel according to claim 1.
