<title>
BIAS DETECTION AND ESTIMATION UNDER TECHNICAL PORTFOLIO REVIEWS
</title>

<abstract>
A bias detection method, system, and computer program product include creating a context of an applicant based on a profile of the applicant and a context of a reviewer based on a profile of the reviewer, predicting a probability of overlapping data points between the applicant and the reviewer, building enriched embeddings for a deep learning model based on the context of the applicant, the context of the reviewer, the overlapping data points, and text from a review and a final decision by the reviewer, and calculating a bias score via a deep learning model run over the enriched embeddings.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented bias detection method for generating a contextual measurement of class and methodological bias in a review processes, the method comprising: creating a context of an applicant based on a profile of the applicant and a context of a reviewer based on a profile of the reviewer; predicting a probability of overlapping data points between the applicant and the reviewer; building enriched embeddings for a deep learning model based on the context of the applicant, the context of the reviewer, the overlapping data points, and text from a review and a final decision by the reviewer; and calculating a bias score via a deep learning model run over the enriched embeddings.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising outputting the bias score to a profile of the reviewer if the bias score is greater than a preset value.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising generating a report that highlights instances of bias in the review by the reviewer based on the bias score.
4. The method of claim 2, further comprising generating a report that highlights instances of bias in the review by the reviewer based on the output bias score.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the bias score includes a combination of: a class bias; a methodological bias; an ecological fallacy; a reviewer bias; a reviewer variation; and an implicit bias.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the bias score includes a combination of: a class bias; and a position related parameter.
7. The method of claim 1, embodied in a cloud-computing environment.
8. A computer program product for bias detection, the computer program product comprising a computer-readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith for generating a contextual measurement of class and methodological bias in a review processes, the program instructions executable by a computer to cause the computer to perform: creating a context of an applicant based on a profile of the applicant and a context of a reviewer based on a profile of the reviewer; predicting a probability of overlapping data points between the applicant and the reviewer, building enriched embeddings for a deep learning model based on the context of the applicant, the context of the reviewer, the overlapping data points, and text from a review and a final decision by the reviewer; and calculating a bias score via a deep learning model run over the enriched embeddings.
9. The computer program product of claim 8, further comprising outputting the bias score to a profile of the reviewer if the bias score is greater than a preset value.
10. The computer program product of claim 8, further comprising generating a report that highlights instances of bias in the review by the reviewer based on the bias score.
11. The computer program product of claim 9, further comprising generating a report that highlights instances of bias in the review by the reviewer based on the output bias score.
12. The computer program product of claim 8, wherein the bias score includes a combination of: a class bias; a methodological bias; an ecological fallacy; a reviewer bias; a reviewer variation; and an implicit bias.
13. The computer program product of claim 8, wherein the bias score includes a combination of: a class bias; and a position related parameter.
14. A bias detection system for generating a contextual measurement of class and methodological bias in a review processes, the system comprising: a processor; and a memory, the memory storing instructions to cause the processor to perform: creating a context of an applicant based on a profile of the applicant and a context of a reviewer based on a profile of the reviewer; predicting a probability of overlapping data points between the applicant and the reviewer, building enriched embeddings for a deep learning model based on the context of the applicant, the context of the reviewer, the overlapping data points, and text from a review and a final decision by the reviewer; and calculating a bias score via a deep learning model run over the enriched embeddings.
15. The system of claim 14, further comprising outputting the bias score to a profile of the reviewer if the bias score is greater than a preset value.
16. The system of claim 14, further comprising generating a report that highlights instances of bias in the review by the reviewer based on the bias score.
17. The system of claim 15, further comprising generating a report that highlights instances of bias in the review by the reviewer based on the output bias score.
18. The system of claim 14, wherein the bias score includes a combination of: a class bias; a methodological bias; an ecological fallacy; a reviewer bias; a reviewer variation; and an implicit bias.
19. The system of claim 14, wherein the bias score includes a combination of: a class bias; and a position related parameter.
20. The system of claim 14, embodied in a cloud-computing environment.
