SYSTEM, METHOD, AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT FOR CONTACT CENTER MANAGEMENT
</title>

<abstract>
A system, method, and computer program product for customer contact management via voice, chat, e-mail and social network contacts includes a balanced service process (BSP) that includes a plurality of cause or response codes for maximizing first contact resolution (FCR) and CSAT. The BSP is incorporated within a contact center (single center, multiple centers and/or work at home), which receives voice calls, SMS messages, email, chat, or social media communications from customers. The BSP in real-time determines dispositions of such contacts, monitors and manages the performance of individual resolvers by incorporating machine learning in said BSP

<claims>
1. A system for customer contact management, comprising: a customer contact environment comprising a database and a plurality of agents, wherein said contact environment is coupled to receive customer contacts from a network and present each of the customer contacts to one or more of said plurality of agents; a balanced service process, comprising: an agent survey for determining and managing real-time, intraday, and historical resolver disposition of contact (RDP) and agents' belief about customers' view on contact resolution and customer satisfaction; a customer survey for determining and managing real-time, intraday, and historical customer input/view on disposition of contact (CDP); wherein said process for aligning the agent and the customer on each contact comprises one or more of the following: a data generator for determining first contact resolution (FCR) rates and customer satisfaction (CSAT) from the results of said agent survey and said customer survey, wherein said results are stored in said database; a first processor within said database for dynamically reporting issues driving contact volume; a second processor within said database for determining every contact that was not resolved; a third processor within said database for assigning a plurality of response codes each of which is indicative of an outcome of said agent survey and said customer survey for each of the contacts; a machine learning processor coupled to said database for processing a response by said customer to said customer survey; and a closed loop channel within said database to define, report and correct actions and trending issues that impede FCR and CSAT.
2. The system according to claim 1, wherein said issues driving contact volume comprise said real-time, intraday, and historical RDP, CDP, FCR and CSAT, and exception rates.
3. The system according to claim 1, wherein said trending issues that impede FCR and CSAT are based on said dynamically reported issues driving contact volume.
4. The system according to claim 1, wherein said agent is prompted with said agent survey upon completion of each said contact.
5. The system according to claim 4, wherein said agent is prompted during said agent survey to answer whether the customer believes the issue causing each said contact was resolved or not.
6. The system according to claim 4, wherein said agent is prompted during said agent survey to answer whether the customer for each said contact was satisfied or not.
7. The system according to claim 1, wherein said customer is prompted with said customer survey upon completion of each said contact.
8. The system according to claim 7, wherein said customer is prompted during said customer survey to answer whether the issue causing each said contact was resolved or not.
9. The system according to claim 7, wherein said customer is prompted during said customer survey to answer whether the customer for each said contact was satisfied or not.
10. The system according to claim 1, wherein said response codes are generated after said agent completes said agent survey and after said customer either completes said customer survey or has had the opportunity to complete said customer survey but did not.
11. The system according to claim 1, wherein said response codes are prioritized.
12. The system according to claim 11, wherein said response codes are indicative of one or more of congruency between agent-customer survey responses, the survey question responded to and, whether or not the call was a repeat for the same concern.
13. The system according to claim 1, wherein said contact environment further comprises a chat bot.
15. The system according to claim 14, wherein said balanced service process further comprises a bot coupled to said database.
16. The system according to claim 15, wherein said bot is adapted to be calibrated by the data generated in said balanced service process.
17. The system according to claim 16, wherein each said agent may be calibrated by the data generated in said balanced service process.
18. The system according to claim 16, wherein said calibrated bot may prompt each said agent.
19. The system according to claim 16, wherein said calibrated bot is adapted for machine learning based on the data generated in said balance service process and stored in said database.
20. The system according to claim 16, wherein said calibrated bot may generate a unique customer survey for each unique customer contact.
21. The system according to claim 16, wherein said unique customer survey is generated by said calibrated bot from data input by said machine learning processor.
22. The system according to claim 1, wherein said machine learning processor is adapted to process data selected from the group comprising a customer profile, data from said customer for contacts of this type; data from all agents for contacts of this type, and data from all customers for contacts of this type.
23. The system according to claim 22, where said customer profile comprises data regarding interaction analysis, previous survey results, whether said data was input by said agent, a bot, or a combination thereof.
