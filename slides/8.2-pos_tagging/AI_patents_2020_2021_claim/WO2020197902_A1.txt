<title>
GROUPING STROKES OF DIGITAL INK
</title>

<abstract>
Technologies are disclosed for grouping strokes of digital ink. The disclosed technologies receive a new stroke of digital ink and, responsive thereto, identify groups of strokes that are candidates for receiving the new stroke. Heuristics are computed for one of the candidate groups and for the new stroke. A confidence value is computed for the new stroke based upon the heuristics for the new stroke and the candidate group. If the confidence value exceeds a confidence threshold, which can be user-adjustable, the new stroke of digital ink is added to the candidate group. This process can then be repeated for other candidate groups until a group is found for the new stroke. If no group is found, a new group can be created for the new stroke. A machine learning model can also generate weights for use in computing confidence values.

<claims>
1. A computing device, comprising:
a processor; and
a memory storing instructions executable by the processor to:
receive a new stroke of digital ink,
responsive to receiving the new stroke of digital ink,
identify candidate groups for the new stroke of digital ink, compute heuristics for a group selected from the candidate groups for the new stroke of digital ink,
generate a confidence value based on the heuristics for the group selected from the candidate groups and heuristics for the new stroke of digital ink, determine whether the confidence value exceeds a confidence threshold, and
adding the new stroke of digital ink to the group selected from the candidate groups if the confidence value exceeds the confidence threshold.
2. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the set of candidate groups for the stroke comprises all of the groups on a canvas.
3. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the set of candidate groups for the stroke encompasses groups on a canvas within a radius determined based on a size of the new stroke of digital ink.
4. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the threshold is user-defined.
5. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the heuristics for the group selected from the candidate groups are computed based upon heuristics for previously-made strokes of digital ink in the group selected from the candidate groups.
6. The computing device of claim 5, wherein the heuristics for the previously-made strokes of digital ink comprise a displacement heuristic measuring a distance from a center of a first previously-made stroke of digital ink to a center of a second previously-made stroke of digital ink.
7. The computing device of claim 5, wherein the heuristics for the previously-made strokes of digital ink comprise an angle heuristic measuring an angle between a center of a first previously-made stroke of digital ink and a center of a second previously-made stroke of digital ink.
8. A computer-implemented method, comprising:
receiving a new stroke of digital ink; identifying a candidate group for the new stroke of digital ink;
computing heuristics for the candidate group;
generating a confidence value based on the heuristics for the candidate group and heuristics for the new stroke of digital ink; and
adding the new stroke of digital ink to the candidate group if the confidence value exceeds a confidence threshold.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 8, wherein the confidence value is computed by comparing the heuristics for the candidate group and the heuristics for the new stroke of digital ink.
10. The computer-implemented method of claim 8, wherein the heuristics for the candidate group and the heuristics for the new stroke of digital ink comprise one or more of a displacement heuristic, an angle heuristic, a time heuristic, a length heuristic, a device heuristic, an ink type heuristic, or a user heuristic.
11. The computer-implemented method of claim 8, wherein the confidence threshold is user-definable.
12. A computer-readable storage medium having computer-executable instructions stored thereupon which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to:
receive a stroke of digital ink;
generate one or more confidence values for the stroke of digital ink;
provide the one or more confidence values to a machine learning (ML) model trained to generate a grouping decision based upon the one or more confidence values; and
add the stroke of digital ink to a group of strokes of digital ink based on the grouping decision generated by the ML model.
13. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein the ML model comprises a support vector machine (SVM).
14. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein the one or more confidence values are computed based on heuristics for the group and heuristics for the stroke of digital ink.
15. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 14, wherein the heuristics for the group and the heuristics for the new stroke of digital ink comprise one or more of a displacement heuristic, an angle heuristic, a time heuristic, a length heuristic, a device heuristic, an ink type heuristic, or a user heuristic.
