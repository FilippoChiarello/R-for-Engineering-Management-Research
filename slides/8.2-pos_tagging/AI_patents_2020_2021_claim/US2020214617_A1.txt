METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR VAGINAL THERAPEUTIC DEVICE FITTING
</title>

<abstract>
A variety of medical and non-medical devices are exploited by users to address a wide range of conditions. However, in the vast majority of instances, the device has a limited number of options with respect to its fit for the user and its performance. Further, the determination of target performance and fit are established on a qualitative basis rather than a quantitative basis. In many instances, these combinations lead to low user acceptance of the device due to the resulting performance and fit issues. Accordingly, it would enhance performance and user acceptance if a quantitative determination provided a recommended type where options exist, and this determination provided the basis of a custom designed device to the user's specific anatomical and/or performance requirements.
