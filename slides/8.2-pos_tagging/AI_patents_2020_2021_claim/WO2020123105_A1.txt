<title>
DETECTING SPURIOUS OBJECTS FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the disclosure relate to detecting spurious objects. For instance, a model 470 may be trained using training data including a plurality of LIDAR data points generated by a LIDAR sensor of a vehicle 100. Each given LIDAR data point includes location information and intensity information, and is associated with waveform data for that given LIDAR data point. At least one of the plurality of LIDAR data points is further associated with a label identifying spurious objects through which the vehicle is able to drive. The model and/or a plurality of heuristics may then be provided to a vehicle in order to allow the vehicle to determine LIDAR data points that correspond to spurious objects. These LIDAR data points may then be filtered from sensor data, and the filtered sensor data may be used to control the vehicle in an autonomous driving mode.

<claims>
1. A method of controlling a vehicle, the method comprising:
receiving, by one or more computing devices, a plurality of LIDAR data points generated by a LIDAR sensor of the vehicle, each given LIDAR data point of the plurality of LIDAR data points (1) including location information and intensity information and (2) being associated with waveform data other than the intensity information of the given LIDAR data point;
determining, by the one or more computing devices, that one or more LIDAR data point of the plurality of LIDAR data points correspond to a spurious object using the waveform data associated with the plurality of LIDAR data points, the spurious object being distinguishable from a solid object by the waveform data associated with the last least one of the plurality of LIDAR data points and through which the vehicle is able to drive;
filtering, by the one or more computing devices, the plurality of LIDAR data points based on the determination; and
using, by the one or more computing devices, the filtered plurality of LIDAR data points to control the vehicle in an autonomous driving mode.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein spurious objects include objects corresponding to at least one of vehicle exhaust, dust, rain, snow, or fog.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the determining is further based on one or more heuristics.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the one or more heuristics is based on a peak elongation of waveform data for a particular LIDAR data point.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the one or more heuristics is based on a number of peaks in waveform data for a particular LIDAR data point.
6. The method of claim 3, wherein the one or more heuristics is based on a peak width in waveform data for a particular LIDAR data point.
7. The method of claim 3, wherein a particular LIDAR data point of the plurality of LIDAR data points is further associated with a peak elongation relative to an expected peak width, and wherein the peak elongation is used to determine whether the LIDAR data point corresponds to a spurious object through which the vehicle is able to drive.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein a particular LIDAR data point of the plurality of LIDAR data points is associated with a plurality of peaks in the waveform data of the particular LIDAR data point, and wherein peak width for each of the plurality of peaks is used to determine whether the particular LIDAR data point corresponds to a spurious object through which the vehicle is able to drive.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the waveform data associated with a particular LIDAR data point of the plurality of LIDAR data points includes a plurality of samples of light received at the LIDAR sensor for the particular LIDAR data point.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising using the waveform data associated with the one or more LIDAR data points to determine a type of the spurious object.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of LIDAR data points corresponds to a single frame captured by the LIDAR sensor.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the frame corresponds to one 360 degree rotation of the LIDAR sensor.
13. The method of claim 1, further comprising, prior to the fdtering, grouping the one or more LIDAR data points determined to correspond to a spurious object such that only grouped LIDAR data points are fdtered from the plurality of LIDAR data points.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the grouping is based on a threshold minimum density of points determined to correspond to a spurious object within a given volume of space.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the fdtering allows the one or more LIDAR data points to be ignored by one or more systems of the vehicle when controlling the vehicle in the autonomous driving mode.
16. The method of claim 1, further comprising prior to the fdtering, confirming the determination based on whether the locations of the one or more LIDAR data points correspond to a location having a particular signal from a second sensor of the vehicle, and wherein the fdtering if further based on the confirmation.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the second sensor is a radar unit.
18. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
receiving information identifying at least some of the plurality of LIDAR data points correspond to an object being road user of a particular type; and
prior to the filtering, confirming the determination based on whether the one or more LIDAR data points correspond to the road user of a particular type based on the received information, and wherein the filtering if further based on the confirmation.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the particular type is one of a pedestrian, a bicyclist, or a vehicle.
20. The method of claim 18, wherein the information includes a bounding box for the object, and confirming the determination is further based on whether the one or more LIDAR data points are associated with locations within the bounding box.
21. The method of claim 1, wherein the spurious object is precipitation.
22. The method of claim 1, wherein the spurious object is dust.
23. The method of claim 1, wherein the spurious object is fog.
