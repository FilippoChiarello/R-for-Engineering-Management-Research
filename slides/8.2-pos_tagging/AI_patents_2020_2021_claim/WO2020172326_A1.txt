<title>
DYNAMIC TEXT MESSAGE PROCESSING IMPLEMENTING ENDPOINT COMMUNICATION CHANNEL SELECTION
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates generally to providing a concierge service to handle a wide variety of topics and user intents via a text messaging interface. The concierge service can be part of a connection management system that can dynamically manage and facilitate natural language conversations between a user making a request or providing an instruction and one or more endpoints for the purposes of fulfilling the request or instruction.

<claims>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: receiving a request text message, wherein the request text message includes a natural language request;
interpreting the natural language request to identify a pre-defined intent;
automatically selecting an endpoint to receive the natural language request based on the pre-defined intent;
forwarding the natural language request to the endpoint;
receiving a response to the natural language request;
generating a response text message based on the response, wherein the response text message includes a natural language response; and
transmitting the response text message.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the natural language request is a request for a resource, and wherein the response text message includes the resource.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the endpoint is selected from a plurality of endpoints.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein interpreting the natural language request includes parsing the natural language request for one or more keywords, and wherein the one or more keywords are used to identify the pre-defined intent.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the request text message is received from a mobile device associated with a user.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 , further comprising:
receiving a second request text message, wherein the second request text message includes a second natural language request; interpreting the second natural language request to identify a second pre-defined intent; automatically selecting an alternate endpoint to receive the second natural language request based on the second pre-defined intent; and
forwarding the second natural language request to the alternate endpoint.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 , further comprising:
receiving a second request text message, wherein the second request text message includes a second natural language request;
automatically selecting an alternate endpoint to receive the second natural language request based on the endpoint; and
forwarding the second natural language request to the alternate endpoint.
8. A system, comprising:
one or more data processors; and
a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium containing instructions which, when executed on the one or more data processors, cause the one or more data processors to perform operations including:
receiving a request text message, wherein the request text message includes a natural language request;
interpreting the natural language request to identify a pre-defined intent;
automatically selecting an endpoint to receive the natural language request based on the pre-defined intent;
forwarding the natural language request to the endpoint;
receiving a response to the natural language request;
generating a response text message based on the response, wherein the response text message includes a natural language response; and
transmitting the response text message.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the natural language request is a request for a resource, and wherein the response text message includes the resource.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the endpoint is selected from a plurality of endpoints.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein interpreting the natural language request includes parsing the natural language request for one or more keywords, and wherein the one or more keywords are used to identify the pre-defined intent.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the request text message is received from a mobile device associated with a user.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the operations further include:
receiving a second request text message, wherein the second request text message includes a second natural language request;
interpreting the second natural language request to identify a second pre-defined intent; automatically selecting an alternate endpoint to receive the second natural language request based on the second pre-defined intent; and
forwarding the second natural language request to the alternate endpoint.
14. The system of claim 8, wherein the operations further include:
receiving a second request text message, wherein the second request text message includes a second natural language request;
automatically selecting an alternate endpoint to receive the second natural language request based on the endpoint; and
forwarding the second natural language request to the alternate endpoint.
15. A computer-program product tangibly embodied in a nontransitory machinereadable storage medium, including instructions configured to cause a data processing apparatus to perform operations including:
receiving a request text message, wherein the request text message includes a natural language request;
interpreting the natural language request to identify a pre-defined intent; automatically selecting an endpoint to receive the natural language request based on the pre-defined intent;
forwarding the natural language request to the endpoint;
receiving a response to the natural language request;
generating a response text message based on the response, wherein the response text message includes a natural language response; and
transmitting the response text message.
16. The computer-program product of claim 15, wherein the natural language request is a request for a resource, and wherein the response text message includes the resource.
17. The computer-program product of claim 15, wherein the endpoint is selected from a plurality of endpoints.
18. The computer-program product of claim 15, wherein interpreting the natural language request includes parsing the natural language request for one or more keywords, and wherein the one or more keywords are used to identify the pre-defined intent.
19. The computer-program product of claim 15, wherein the request text message is received from a mobile device associated with a user.
20. The computer-program product of claim 15, wherein the operations further include:
receiving a second request text message, wherein the second request text message includes a second natural language request;
interpreting the second natural language request to identify a second pre-defined intent; automatically selecting an alternate endpoint to receive the second natural language request based on the second pre-defined intent; and
forwarding the second natural language request to the alternate endpoint.
