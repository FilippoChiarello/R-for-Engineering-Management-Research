APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR GENERATING MEDICAL IMAGE SEGMENTATION DEEP-LEARNING MODEL, AND MEDICAL IMAGE SEGMENTATION DEEP-LEARNING MODEL GENERATED THEREFROM
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a medical image segmentation deep-learning model generation apparatus including a training data generation/allocation unit configured to generate a training dataset through a segmentation result value acquired by inputting a given medical image to an original medical image segmentation deep-learning model and a learning control unit configured to acquire temporary weights using output data corresponding to primary learning by inputting good task data and bad task data sampled from primary learning training datasets to the medical image segmentation deep-learning model and configured to update weights by adding gradients acquired using weights acquired using output data corresponding to secondary learning by inputting good task data and bad task data sampled from secondary learning training datasets to the medical image segmentation deep-learning model, wherein the primary learning and the secondary learning are repeated.
