METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR GENERATING MIXED VOICE DATA
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure discloses a method and system for generating mixed voice data, and belongs to the technical field of voice recognition. In the method for generating mixed voice data according to the present disclosure, a pure voice and noise are collected first, normalization processing is performed on the collected voice data, randomization processing is performed on processed data, then GAIN processing is performed on the data, and finally filter processing is performed to obtain mixed voice data. The system for generating mixed voice data according to the present disclosure includes a collecting unit, a calculating unit, and a storage unit, the collecting unit being electrically connected to the calculating unit, and the calculating unit being connected to the storage unit through a data transmitting unit. In order to overcome the shortage of audio data required for deep learning in the prior art, the present disclosure provides the method and the system for generating mixed voice data, so that mixed voice data can be automatically generated to meet the data requirement of deep learning.
