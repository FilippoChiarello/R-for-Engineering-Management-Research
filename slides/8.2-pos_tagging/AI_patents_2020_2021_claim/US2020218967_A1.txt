Complex-Valued Neural Networks
</title>

<abstract>
A hardware accelerator including a crossbar array programmed to calculate node values of a neural network, the crossbar array comprising a plurality of row lines, a plurality of column lines, and a memory cell coupled between each combination of one row line and one column line. Also, an energy storing element disposed in the crossbar array between each combination of one row line and one column line and a filter that receives information from the energy storing element and provides new information for each node of the neural network.
