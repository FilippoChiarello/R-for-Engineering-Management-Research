TABLE GAME MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, GAME TOKEN, AND INSPECTION APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
A table game management system according to the present invention includes a camera that images a game token placed on a game table, and a management control device that grasps a type of the game token placed on the game table based on a color of a side face of the game token imaged by the camera.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system comprising: a camera; and a control device; wherein: the camera is configured to generate an image of an area in which one or more chips are located; and the control device is configured to, for each of the one or more chips: identify in the image a respective color pattern formed by a respective set of colors on a respective circumferentially extending side face of the respective chip; based on the identified color pattern, determine a respective type or value of the respective chip; and generate an output based on the respective determined types or values of the chips.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the camera is configured to generate an image of a plurality of chips placed on a plurality of betting areas, and the control device is configured to identify types or values of chips placed on the plurality of betting areas using artificial intelligence or machine learning technology.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the plurality of chips are placed at different distances from the camera.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the control device is further configured to identify a position of the plurality of chips placed on the plurality of betting areas.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein, for each of the chips, the respective determination of the respective type or value of the respective chip is based on a respective combination of two or more colors of the pattern on the side face of the respective chip.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein each of at least one of the set of colors of the respective color pattern extends at least partially in a circumferential direction to a greater degree than an extent to which the respective color extends perpendicularly to the circumferential direction.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the control device is configured to identify an error state based on the determined types or values of the one or more chips, and the output is the error identification.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the control device is configured to: obtain a game result of a game played using the chips; and for each of one or more players of the game and/or for a casino, determine a respective balance amount, a respective collection amount for the game, and/or a respective payment amount for the game based on (a) the obtained game result, (b) the identified types or values of the chips.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the control device is configured to determine the respective balance amount, collection amount, and/or payment amount further based on one or more numbers of the chips identified in the image and one or positions of a game table at which the control device identifies the chips to be located in the image.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the control device is configured to identify an error state based on the determined balance amount, collection amount, and/or payment amount, and the output is the error identification.
