METHODS TO ASSESS THE RISK OF BEING AFFECTED BY PROSTATE CANCER
</title>

<abstract>
This invention relates to methods for assessing the risk that a male subject is affected by prostate cancer and to methods for assessing the risk that such cancer is aggressive, by analysing the gaseous headspace of urine samples with at least three metal oxide semiconductor-based gas sensors, wherein the metal oxide of the first gas sensor is pure or doped SnO2, the metal oxide of the second sensor is pure or doped ZnO and the metal oxides of the third sensor are pure or doped SnO2, pure or doped TiO2 and pure or doped Nb2O5.

<claims>
1. An in vitro method to assess the risk that a subject is affected by prostate cancer, such method comprising:
a) providing a urine sample from said subject which does not comprise the last jet of a naturally voided urine sample;
b) heating the sample to above 50°C in a closed, humidity-controlled environment. c) analysing the headspace of the sample heated in step b), under humidity control, with at least 3 Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) -based gas sensors, wherein the metal oxide of the first gas sensor is pure or doped SnO2, the metal oxide of the second sensor is pure or doped ZnO and the metal oxides of the third sensor are pure or doped SnO2, pure or doped TiO2 and pure or doped Nb2O5;
d) comparing the values obtained in step c) to reference values for each sensor, thereby assessing the risk that a subject is affected by prostate cancer.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the reference values are those obtained on urine samples of subjects that have been classified as prostate cancer free or affected by prostate cancer by other means.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the comparison of step comprises the scoring, obtained through multivariate statistical analysis, of the data acquired in step c) against data acquired from the analysis of urine samples of subjects that have been classified as prostate cancer free or affected by prostate cancer by other means.
4. An in vitro method to assess the risk that a subject is affected by an aggressive form of prostate cancer, such method comprising
a) providing a urine sample from said subject which does not comprise the last jet of a naturally voided urine sample;
b) heating the sample to above 50°C in a closed, humidity-controlled environment; c) analysing the headspace of the sample heated in step b), under humidity control, with at least 3 MOS-based gas sensors, wherein the metal oxide of the first gas sensor is pure or doped SnO2, the metal oxide of the second sensor is pure or doped ZnO and the metal oxides of the third sensor are pure or doped SnO2, pure or doped TiO2 and pure or doped Nb2O5.
d) comparing the values obtained in step c) to reference values for each sensor, thereby assessing the risk that a subject is affected by an aggressive form of prostate cancer
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the reference values include those obtained on urine samples of subjects that have been classified as affected by prostate cancer with a certain risk of being aggressive by other means.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein the comparison of step d) comprises the scoring, obtained through multivariate statistical analysis, of the data acquired in step c) against data acquired from the analysis of urine samples of subjects that have been classified as affected by prostate cancer with a certain risk of being aggressive by other means.
7. The method of claims 1-6, wherein the metal oxide of the first sensor is doped with MoO3.
8. The method of claims 1-6, wherein the metal oxide of the first sensor is doped with Mo.
9. The method of claims 1-8, wherein the metal oxide of the second sensor is pure ZnO.
10. The method of claims 1-9, wherein the metal oxides of the third gas sensor are not doped.
11. The method of claims 1-6, wherein the dopant for any given sensor, where present, is independently selected from the list of Mo, MoO3, Pd, Ag, Cu, Al, Pb, Cr, and Pt.
12. The method of claims 1-11, wherein the temperature of step b) is selected from the list of above 51°C, above 52°C, above 53°C, above 54°C, above 55°C, above 56°C, above 57°C, above 58°C and above 59°C.
13. The method of claims 1-11, wherein the temperature of step b) is selected from the list of below 61°C, below 62°C, below 63°C, below 64°C, below 65°C, below 66°C, below 67°C, below 68°C, below 69°C, below 70°C, below 71°C, below 72°C, below 73°C, below 74°C, below 75°C, below 76°C, below 77°C, below 78°C, below 79°C, below 80°C, below 81°C, below 82°C, below 83°C, below 84°C, below 85°C, below 86°C, below 87°C, below 88°C, below 89°C, below 90°C, below 91°C, below 92°C, below 93°C, below 94°C, below 95°C, below 96°C, below 97°C, below 98°C, below 99°C and below 100°C.
