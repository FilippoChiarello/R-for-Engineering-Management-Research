<title>
RFID-BASED NAVIGATION OF AN AUTONOMOUS GUIDED VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques are described herein that are capable of performing RFID-based navigation of an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV). An intended location of the AGV is determined based at least in part on a previously determined location of the AGV and further based at least in part on a calculated motion of the AGV from the previously determined location. The AGV includes an RFID device that is paired with RFID devices in an environment of the AGV. The RFID device of the AGV and one or more of the RFID devices in the environment may communicate in accordance with an RFID technique to enable the AGV to determine an actual location of the AGV. A reference location of the AGV on which navigation of the AGV is based is set to be the actual location rather than the intended location.
