Method and system of alarm rationalization in an industrial control system
</title>

<abstract>
Described herein are systems and methods of alarm rationalization for an industrial control system. This can comprise building a model of the industrial control system, wherein the model includes components that are monitored or controlled by the industrial control system and alarms associated with the components; training the model by applying one or more machine learning algorithms against a historical database of alarms for the industrial control system; and applying the trained model against the industrial control system for alarm management of the industrial control system.

<claims>
1. A method of alarm rationalization for an industrial control system comprising: building a model of an alarm rationalization process for the industrial control system, wherein the model includes components that are monitored or controlled by the industrial control system and alarms associated with the components; training the model by applying one or more machine learning algorithms against a historical database of alarms and corresponding decisions for the industrial control system; applying the trained model against the industrial control system for alarm rationalization of the industrial control system; and refining the model by machine learning after the model has been applied against the industrial control system.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising applying the trained model against a database of alarms before applying the trained model against the industrial control system for testing purposes.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein training the model by applying one or more machine learning algorithms against the historical database of alarms for the industrial control system comprises one or more of grouping alarms, decreasing alarm levels, or creating contextual alarms.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein training the model by applying one or more machine learning algorithms against the historical database of alarms for the industrial control system, wherein the one or more machine learning algorithms is at least one of: i) a data mining algorithm to identify frequent patterns in alarm sequences, ii) a clustering algorithm to correlate alarms and process states, and, iii) a supervised machine learning algorithm to model the rationalization process.
5. A system for alarm rationalization for an industrial control system comprising: a computing device, said computing device having at least a processor and a memory, wherein the processor executes computer-executable instructions stored in the memory, said computer executable instructions cause the processor to: build a model of an alarm rationalization process for the industrial control system, wherein the model includes components that are monitored or controlled by the industrial control system and alarms associated with the components; train the model by applying one or more machine learning algorithms against a historical database of alarms and corresponding decisions for the industrial control system; apply the trained model against the industrial control system for alarm rationalization of the industrial control system; and refine the model by machine learning after the model has been applied against the industrial control system.
6. The system of claim 5, further comprising the processor executing computer-executable instructions stored in the memory that cause the processor to apply the trained model against a database of alarms before applying the trained model against the industrial control system for testing purposes.
7. The system of claim 5, wherein training the model by applying one or more machine learning algorithms against the historical database of alarms for the industrial control system comprises the processor executing computer-executable instructions stored in the memory that cause the processor to one or more of grouping alarms, decreasing alarm levels, or creating contextual alarms.
8. The system of claim 5, wherein training the model by applying one or more machine learning algorithms against the historical database of alarms for the industrial control system comprises the processor executing computer-executable instructions stored in the memory that cause the processor to apply one or more machine learning algorithms, wherein the one or more machine learning algorithms is at least one of: i) a data mining algorithm to identify frequent patterns in alarm sequences, ii) a clustering algorithm to correlate alarms and process states, and, iii) a supervised machine learning algorithm to model the rationalization process.

11. The computer-readable medium of claim 10, further comprising applying the trained model against a database of alarms before applying the trained model against the industrial control system for testing purposes.
12. The computer-readable medium of claim 10, wherein training the model by applying one or more machine learning algorithms against the historical database of alarms for the industrial control system comprises one or more of grouping alarms, decreasing alarm levels, or creating contextual alarms.
13. The computer-readable medium of claim 10, wherein training the model by applying one or more machine learning algorithms against the historical database of alarms for the industrial control system, wherein the one or more machine learning algorithms is at least one of: i) a data mining algorithm to identify frequent patterns in alarm sequences, ii) a clustering algorithm to correlate alarms and process states, and, iii) a supervised machine learning algorithm to model the rationalization process.
