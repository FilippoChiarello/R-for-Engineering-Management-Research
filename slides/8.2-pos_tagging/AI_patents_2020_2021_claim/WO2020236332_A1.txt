INTERACTIVE CHART RECOMMENDER
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods directed to providing recommended charts are provided. More specifically, a selection of data arranged in a plurality of data series may be received and classified into series data types. Based on the series data type for each data series of the plurality of data series, a plurality of recommended charts visually describing the data may be automatically provided to a user interface, wherein each chart of the plurality of recommended charts is a different chart type visually describing the data. To provide the plurality of recommended charts, best practices and/or one or more machine learning models may be utilized. In some instances, the charts provided in the user interface may automatically change or otherwise updated based on a different selection of data and/or an assignment of a different data series type to a data series.

<claims>
1. A computer storage media containing computer executable instructions which, when executed by a computer, perform a method for providing recommended charts, the method comprising:
receiving a selection of data arranged in a plurality of data series;
classifying each data series of the plurality of data series into a series data type; and
based on the series data type for each data series of the plurality of data series, providing a plurality of recommended charts visually describing the data, wherein each chart of the plurality of recommended charts is a different chart type.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
performing a machine learning analysis utilizing one or more machine learning models to classify each data series of the plurality of data series into the series data type; performing the machine learning analysis utilizing the one or more machine learning models to rank each chart of the plurality of recommended charts; and
displaying, at a graphical user interface, each chart of the plurality of
recommended charts in accordance with each chart's respective ranking.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising:
receiving a selection of a first chart of the plurality of recommend charts; and updating the one or more machine learning models based on the received selection.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
presenting the data in a first portion of a graphical user interface; and
presenting the plurality of recommend charts in a second portion of the graphical user interface, wherein the first portion of the graphical user interface is adjacent to the second portion of the graphical user interface.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising:
receiving a second selection of data arranged in a plurality of data series; and based on the series data type for each data series of the plurality of data series associated with the second selection of data, updating the second portion of the graphical user interface to present a second plurality of recommended charts, wherein the second plurality of recommended charts are different than the plurality of recommended charts previously displayed in the second portion of the graphical user interface.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the second selection of data is a subset of the data.
7. The method of claim 4, further comprising: receiving an indication to change a series data type corresponding to a first data series of the plurality of data series; and
based on the changed series data type, updating the second portion of the graphical user interface to present a second plurality of recommended charts, wherein the second plurality of recommended charts are different than the plurality of recommended charts previously displayed in the second portion of the graphical user interface.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising:
displaying a label associated with each data series; and
displaying an indication of the corresponding data series type adjacent to the respective label.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the recommended charts include a label for one or more chart axis, and a label for one or more of the data series.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the chart type may be associated with at least one of a line chart, scatter plot, column chart, bar chart, or geographic chart.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of recommended charts is based on the series data type and one or more best practices for presenting data in a graphical form.
12. A system for providing recommended charts, the system comprising:
one or more processors; and
a memory coupled to the one or more processors, the one or more processors operable to:
receive data arranged in a plurality of data series;
classify one or more data series of the plurality of data series into one or more series data types; and
based on the received data arranged in the plurality of data series and a subset of the one or more series data types for the one or more data series of the plurality of data series, provide a plurality of recommended charts visually describing the data, wherein each chart of the plurality of recommended charts is a different chart type.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the one or more processors are operable to: provide the plurality of recommended charts to a computing device that is different from the system including the one or more processors.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the one or more processors are operable to: perform a machine learning analysis utilizing one or more machine learning models to classify the one or more data series of the plurality of data series into the series data types; perform the machine learning analysis utilizing the one or more machine learning models to rank each chart of the plurality of recommended charts; and
provide each chart of the plurality of recommended charts to the computing device. 15. The system of claim 14, wherein the one or more processors are operable to:
receive a selection of a first chart of the plurality of recommend charts; and update the one or more machine learning models based on the received selection.
