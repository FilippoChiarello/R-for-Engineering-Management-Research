MODEL RESELECTION FOR ACCOMMODATING UNSATISFACTORY TRAINING DATA
</title>

<abstract>
An anomaly analysis system generates models capable of more accurately identifying anomalies in data that contains unsatisfactory training data. The anomaly analysis system determines when data contains unsatisfactory training data. When an anomaly is detected in data using an initially selected model, and the data contains unsatisfactory training data, model reselection is performed. The reselected model analyzes the data. The reselected model is used to identify any anomalies in the data based on a data point from the data being outside of a confidence interval related to a predicted point by the reselected model corresponding to the data point.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method, comprising: determining that a set of training data, used to train a first predictive model selected to predict data points, includes unsatisfactory training data to train the predictive model for use in accurately predicting data anomalies; based on the determination that the set of training data includes the unsatisfactory training data, performing model reselection to select a second predictive model to accurately predict data points to detect data anomalies; and utilizing the second predictive model to predict data points for use in detecting data anomalies.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the determination that the set of training data includes the unsatisfactory training data is based on a lack of stationarity.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, further comprising: determining the stationarity using an Augmented Dicky-Fuller test.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein determination that the set of training data includes the unsatisfactory training data is based on a predefined percentage of zeroes occurring in the set of training data.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein performing the model reselection further comprises: generating a Mean Absolute Error for one or more models; selecting one of the one or more models as the second predictive model, wherein the second predictive model is selected based on a lowest Mean Absolute Error value.
