METHOD AND DEVICE FOR DISPLAYING EXPLANATION OF REFERENCE NUMERAL IN PATENT DRAWING IMAGE USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY BASED MACHINE LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a device and a method for placing an original or translated explanation of a reference numeral around the reference numeral in a patent drawing, by recognizing a reference numeral included in a patent drawing, searching for a space to place an explanation corresponding to the recognized reference numeral, generating a placement information set including position information for displaying the explanation of the reference numeral in the searched empty space, and providing the placement information set to a corresponding patent drawing image. Utilization of the present invention makes it possible to recognize clearly and quickly what is represented by a reference numeral included in a patent drawing, thereby increasing the readability of a drawing, and facilitating understanding of the technical idea of a patent through patent drawings.

<claims>
1. A method for placing at least one technical term of at least one reference sign in at least one drawing around the at least one reference sign, comprising steps of: (a) on condition that i) a first state in which an OCR device has acquired at least one drawing image file corresponding to at least one drawing identifier related to at least one patent identifier, has recognized at least one reference sign in at least one drawing from the drawing image file, and has generated an information set on the reference sign in the drawing, including location information on the reference sign in the drawing, and that ii) a second state in which a reference sign and technical term recognizing device has parsed a specification text string including the reference sign and its corresponding technical term, has recognized the reference sign in a specification and its corresponding technical term included in the specification text string, and has generated each information set, for each patent identifier, on mapping between the reference sign in the specification and its corresponding technical term, have been performed, an integrating server acquiring (1) the information set on the mapping between the reference sign in the specification and its corresponding technical term about the patent identifier and (2) the information set on the reference sign in the drawing about the drawing identifier; (b) the integrating server searching for a specific free space, among entire free space, on the drawing image, where the technical term of the reference sign is to be displayed, by using (i) the location information on the reference sign in the drawing included in the information set on the reference sign in the drawing and (ii) term information on the reference sign mapped onto the reference sign in the specification included in the information set on the mapping between the reference sign in the specification and its corresponding technical term; and (c) the integrating server generating an information set on placement including location information to be used for displaying the technical term of the reference sign on the drawing image by using the specific free space; wherein the reference sign in the drawing and the reference sign in the specification are text strings determined as identical to each other.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the reference sign in the drawing is recognized in order to achieve the first state by performing steps of: (i1) sampling over collected image data including each image corresponding to each character; (i2) dividing the sampled image data into n folders wherein n is a natural number larger than 2; (i3) learning a learning model using a part of the sampled image data in n−1 folders as training data, and performing a cross validation process of acquiring at least one test error n times with a part of the sampled image data in the n folders excluding said n−1 folders, as test data, to thereby optimize at least one hyper parameter; and (i4) learning at least one parameter of the learning model with the optimized hyper parameter.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the learning model is at least one of a discriminant deep learning model and a generative deep learning model, and wherein the hyper parameter is at least one of (i) the number of layers, (ii) the number of hidden variables, (iii) a rate of drop out, (iv) a filter size, and (v) at least one activation function.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of (b) includes steps of: (b1) estimating a placement size for placing the technical term of the reference sign in the drawing; (b2) searching nearby areas of the reference sign in the drawing for the specific free space, among the entire free space, whose size is equal to or greater than the placement size estimated at the step of (b1); and (b3) generating the information set on the placement for placing the technical term of the reference sign on the specific free space.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the steps of (b1) and (b2) are processed for each reference sign in the drawing, and wherein the step of (b2) includes steps of: on condition that a first specific free space for the technical term of a first reference sign to an i-th specific free space for the technical term of an i-th reference sign have been determined wherein i is a natural number larger than 1, (b21) searching for an (i+1)-th specific free space for the technical term of an (i+1)-th reference sign such that the (i+1)-th specific free space overlaps none of the first specific free space to the i-th specific free space; and (b22) i) if no overlap occurs, generating the information set on the placement for the technical term of the (i+1)-th reference sign using information on the (i+1)-th specific free space and ii) if an overlap occurs, raising an exception for the technical term of the (i+1)-th reference sign.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein orientations and locations to be searched for the specific free space for the technical term of the reference sign are prioritized, wherein, at the step of (b2), the specific free space for the technical term of the reference sign is searched for according to each priority of the locations per each reference sign in the drawing, and wherein, when searching for the free space for the technical term of the reference sign according to each priority, if the specific free space for the technical term of the reference sign crosses a physical boundary of the drawing, the specific free space for the technical term of the reference sign is searched for based on a next priority.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising a step of: (d) the integrating server generating an information set on combination of the reference sign and its corresponding technical term by using the information set on the placement, wherein the information set on the combination of the reference sign and its corresponding technical term includes condition data to be used for determining how the technical term of the reference sign is to be displayed on the drawing image.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the information set on the combination of the reference sign and its corresponding technical term includes each piece of location information where the technical term of the reference sign is to be placed, and selectively includes at least one of information on a type of a font, information on a size of a font, information on color, information on grayscale, information on color saturation, and information on orientations, for the technical term of the reference sign.
