ANALYSIS APPARATUS, STRATUM AGE ESTIMATION APPARATUS, ANALYSIS METHOD, STRATUM AGE ESTIMATION METHOD, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
An analysis apparatus (100) includes an image acquisition unit (110) and an analysis unit (120). The image acquisition unit (110) acquires image data of a microfossil in a sample collected from a stratum. The analysis unit (120) analyzes the image data acquired by the image acquisition unit (110) using a machine learning result to analyze a taxon or kind of the microfossil in the image data.

<claims>
1. An analysis apparatus comprising: an image acquisition unit that acquires image data of a microfossil in a sample collected from a stratum; and an analysis unit that analyzes the image data using a machine learning result to analyze a taxon or kind of the microfossil in the image data.
2. The analysis apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the analysis unit generates, as an analysis result, information indicating the taxon or kind of the microfossil in the image data and a certainty factor for the taxon or kind.
3. The analysis apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the image acquisition unit processes one piece of original image data to cut out a plurality of pieces of the image data from the one piece of original image data.
4. The analysis apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the analysis unit generates an analysis result for each taxon or kind of the microfossil using a plurality of machine learning results prepared for each taxon or kind of the microfossil.
5. The analysis apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a preprocessing unit that executes preprocessing on the image data before the analysis by the analysis unit.
6. The analysis apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the preprocessing unit executes processing of adjusting at least one of brightness and an edge of the image data as the preprocessing.
7. The analysis apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the preprocessing unit acquires information for discriminating an analysis target together with the image data and executes preprocessing decided for each analysis target discriminated by the information.
8. The analysis apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: an age estimation unit that estimates and outputs an age of the stratum from which the sample is collected, using an analysis result by the analysis unit.
9. The analysis apparatus according to claim 8, wherein the age estimation unit estimates and outputs the age of the stratum from which the sample is collected, using a standard distribution of the microfossil for each age.
10. The analysis apparatus according to claim 9, wherein the age estimation unit computes a distribution of the microfossil in the sample using an analysis result for each taxon or kind of the microfossil by the analysis unit, and estimates and outputs the age of the stratum from which the sample is collected on the basis of the distribution of the microfossil in the sample and the standard distribution of the microfossil for each age.
11. The analysis apparatus according to claim 8, wherein the age estimation unit processes the analysis result using a machine learning result to estimate and output the age of the stratum from which the sample is collected.
12. A stratum age estimation apparatus comprising: an analysis result acquisition unit that acquires an analysis result of a taxon or kind of a microfossil in a sample collected from a stratum; and an age estimation unit that estimates and outputs an age of the stratum from which the sample is collected, using the analysis result.
13. The stratum age estimation apparatus according to claim 12, wherein the age estimation unit estimates and outputs the age of the stratum from which the sample is collected, using a standard distribution of the microfossil for each age.
14. The stratum age estimation apparatus according to claim 13, wherein the analysis result acquisition unit acquires the analysis result for each taxon or kind of the microfossil in the sample, and wherein the age estimation unit computes a distribution of the microfossil in the sample using the analysis result for each taxon of the microfossil, and estimates and outputs the age of the stratum from which the sample is collected on the basis of the distribution of the microfossil in the sample and the standard distribution of the microfossil for each age.
