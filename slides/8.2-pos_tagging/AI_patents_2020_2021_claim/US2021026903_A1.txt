MESSAGING SEARCH AND MANAGEMENT APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
The Messaging Search and Management Apparatuses, Methods and Systems ("MSM") transforms message, ranking request inputs via MSM components into work graphs, ML structure input data, ML structure, ranking response outputs. A work graph generation request that includes group level access control data may be obtained. A set of metadata access control carrying messages, a set of users, a set of channels, and a set of topics with access control data corresponding to the group level access control data may be determined. A user priority score for each of the other users, a channel priority score for each of the channels, and a topic priority score for each of the topics, from the perspective of each user, may be calculated. A work graph data structure may be generated that includes, for each user, data regarding the calculated user priority scores, channel priority scores, and topic priority scores.

<claims>
1. A ranking determining apparatus, comprising: a memory; a component collection in the memory, including: a ranking determining component; a processor disposed in communication with the memory, and configured to issue a plurality of processing instructions from the component collection stored in the memory, wherein the processor issues instructions from the ranking determining component, stored in the memory, to: obtain, via at least one processor, a ranking request associated with a user, wherein the ranking request includes group level access control data, wherein access control data associated with the user corresponds to the group level access control data; determine, via at least one processor, a ranking type associated with the ranking request, wherein the ranking type indicates a ranking application associated with the ranking request; retrieve, via at least one processor, a machine learning structure for the ranking request based on the group level access control data and the ranking type; determine, via at least one processor, a set of inputs associated with the machine learning structure, wherein at least some of the inputs in the set of inputs correspond to work graph data; obtain, via at least one processor, ranking data, wherein the ranking data's access control data corresponds to the group level access control data, wherein the ranking data includes work graph data associated with the user and a set of applicable data items; determine, via at least one processor, input values for the determined set of inputs for each of the applicable data items; determine, via at least one processor, a ranking score for each of the applicable data items using the machine learning structure and the corresponding input values; select, via at least one processor, a set of highest ranked applicable data items; and facilitate, via at least one processor, generating a user interface configured to display information regarding the selected set of highest ranked applicable data items.
