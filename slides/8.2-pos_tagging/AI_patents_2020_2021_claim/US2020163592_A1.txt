ON-DEMAND TESTING FOR SELECTED CONDITIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A device is used to monitor, in real-time, one or more environment conditions of an environment in which a user is located. Based on the monitoring, an alert condition relating to the environment is detected. Based on detecting the alert condition, on-demand testing of a sensory component of the user is initiated. The on-demand testing tests for a selected condition relating to the health of the user.

<claims>
1. A method of facilitating testing, said method comprising: monitoring, using a device, one or more environment conditions of an environment in which a user is located, the monitoring being performed in real-time; detecting, based on the monitoring, an alert condition relating to the environment; initiating, based on detecting the alert condition, on-demand testing of a sensory component of the user, the on-demand testing to test for a selected condition relating to health of the user.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the device comprises a wearable device.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the wearable device comprises a hearing protection device.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the monitoring comprises using one or more microphones of the hearing protection device to determine a noise level within the environment, the noise level being an environment condition.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the alert condition comprises a noise level in the environment above a certain value.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the initiating comprises sending a notification by the device, based on the alert condition, indicating a test is to be performed on-demand.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising performing the test, on-demand, based on the notification.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising saving results of the test, the results to be used in analytics to determine whether one or more changes are to be made to the environment or the device.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the performing the test comprises performing the test using the device.
10. The method of claim 7, wherein the device comprises a hearing protection device, and wherein the performing the test comprises performing a hearing test using the hearing protection device, based on the alert condition comprising a noise level above a certain value.
11. The method of claim 7, further comprising automatically adjusting a machine of the environment contributing to the alert condition, based on results of the test.
12. A system for facilitating testing, said system comprising: a device configured to perform a method, the method comprising: monitoring, using the device, one or more environment conditions of an environment in which a user is located, the monitoring being performed in real-time; detecting, based on the monitoring, an alert condition relating to the environment; initiating, based on detecting the alert condition, on-demand testing of a sensory component of the user, the on-demand testing to test for a selected condition relating to health of the user.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the device comprises a hearing protection device, and the monitoring comprises using one or more microphones of the hearing protection device to determine a noise level within the environment, the noise level being an environment condition.
14. The system of claim 12, wherein the initiating comprises sending a notification by the device, based on the alert condition, indicating a test is to be performed on-demand.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the method further comprises performing the test, on-demand, based on the notification.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the device comprises a hearing protection device, and wherein the performing the test comprises performing a hearing test using the hearing protection device, based on the alert condition comprising a noise level above a certain value.
17. The system of claim 15, wherein the method further comprises automatically adjusting a machine of the environment contributing to the alert condition, based on results of the test.
18. A computer program product for facilitating testing, said computer program product comprising: a computer readable storage medium readable by a processing circuit and storing instructions for performing a method comprising: monitoring, using a device, one or more environment conditions of an environment in which a user is located, the monitoring being performed in real-time; detecting, based on the monitoring, an alert condition relating to the environment; initiating, based on detecting the alert condition, on-demand testing of a sensory component of the user, the on-demand testing to test for a selected condition relating to health of the user.
19. The computer program product of claim 18, wherein the initiating comprises sending a notification by the device, based on the alert condition, indicating a test is to be performed on-demand.
20. The computer program product of claim 19, wherein the method further comprises performing the test, on-demand, based on the notification.
