METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DESIGN ASSURANCE
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus comprises a rules application program interface (API) configured to receive, from a computer-aided design (CAD) module, facts about at least part of a vessel or vessel-related structure as modelled in a computer model, and to transmit the facts to a rules engine; and a rules engine configured to apply a set of design rules to the facts to determine whether the computer model is in compliance with the design rules, the set of design rules comprising both implicit and explicit dependencies between design rules, and to output a determination of whether the computer model is in compliance with the set of design rules.
