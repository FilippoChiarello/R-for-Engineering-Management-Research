Method and System for Providing At Least One Image Captured By a Scene Camera of a Vehicle
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to a method of providing at least one image of at least one real object captured by at least one scene camera of a plurality of scene cameras mounted on a vehicle. The method includes: providing camera poses of respective scene cameras of the plurality of scene cameras relative to a reference coordinate system associated with the vehicle, providing user attention data related to a user captured by an information capturing device, providing at least one attention direction relative to the reference coordinate system from the user attention data, determining at least one of the scene cameras among the plurality of scene cameras according to the at least one attention direction and the respective camera pose of the at least one of the scene cameras, and providing at least one image of at least one real object captured by the at least one of the scene cameras.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A non-transitory computer readable medium storing instructions executable by one or more processors to: receive user attention data from an information capturing device indicating an attention direction of a user; obtain an image captured by a scene camera in accordance with the attention direction; identify an object of interest in the obtained image by projecting the attention direction into the obtained image to identify a region of interest within the image; and generate information related to the object of interest.
2. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the scene camera is selected from a plurality of scene cameras.
3. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 2, further comprising computer code to: determine a camera pose of each of the plurality of scene cameras, wherein the scene camera is selected based on a determination that a field of view of the scene camera overlaps the attention direction based on the camera pose and the attention direction.
4. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the user attention data includes an image of a hand of the user, and wherein the attention direction includes a direction in which the hand of the user is pointing.
5. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the information comprises order information to acquire an item associated with the object of interest.
6. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 5, further comprising computer readable code to transmit the information to a server for an online provider associated with the item.
7. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, further comprising instructions to initiate display, at a display device, of enhanced information related to the object of interest.
8. A system comprising: one or more processors; and one or more non-transitory computer readable media storing instructions executable by the one or more processors to: receive user attention data from an information capturing device indicating an attention direction of a user; obtain an image captured by a scene camera in accordance with the attention direction; identify an object of interest in the obtained image by projecting the attention direction into the obtained image to identify a region of interest within the image; and generate information related to the object of interest.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the scene camera is selected from a plurality of scene cameras.
10. The system of claim 9, further comprising computer code to: determine a camera pose of each of the plurality of scene cameras, wherein the scene camera is selected based on a determination that a field of view of the scene camera overlaps the attention direction based on the camera pose and the attention direction.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the user attention data includes an image of a hand of the user, and wherein the attention direction includes a direction in which the hand of the user is pointing.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the information comprises order information to acquire an item associated with the object of interest.
13. The system of claim 12, further comprising computer readable code to transmit the information to a server for an online provider associated with the item.
14. The system of claim 8, further comprising instructions to initiate display, at a display device, of enhanced information related to the object of interest.
15. A method comprising: receiving user attention data from an information capturing device indicating an attention direction of a user; obtaining an image captured by a scene camera in accordance with the attention direction; identifying an object of interest in the obtained image by projecting the attention direction into the obtained image to identify a region of interest within the image; and generating information related to the object of interest.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the scene camera is selected from a plurality of scene cameras.
17. The method of claim 16, further comprising: determining a camera pose of each of the plurality of scene cameras, wherein the scene camera is selected based on a determination that a field of view of the scene camera overlaps the attention direction based on the camera pose and the attention direction.
18. The method of claim 15, wherein the user attention data includes an image of a hand of the user, and wherein the attention direction includes a direction in which the hand of the user is pointing.
19. The method of claim 15, wherein the information comprises order information to acquire an item associated with the object of interest.
20. The method of claim 19, further comprising transmitting the information to a server for an online provider associated with the item.
