System and method of monitoring consumable wear components of semi-autonomous floor care equipment
</title>

<abstract>
In some embodiments, a method of monitoring, analyzing, and/or validating the lifecycle and maintenance schedule of consumable wear components used in or by a semi-autonomous cleaning device can include scanning a unique identifier associated with a consumable component and receiving, at the cleaning device, data associated with the unique identifier. A signal associated with the data is sent from the cleaning device to a host device. After scanning the unique identifier, the consumable component is installed in or on the cleaning device. During use of the cleaning device, a status of the consumable component is monitored and a signal is sent to the host device in response to one or more characteristics associated with the consumable component meeting a criterion.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method of monitoring usage of one or more consumable components of a floor care equipment, the method comprising: scanning a consumable component on the floor care equipment using an information capture system, the consumable component having at least one identifier that contains information relating to the consumable component; installing the consumable component on the floor care equipment; adjusting a maintenance schedule algorithm on the computer associated with the floor care equipment taking into consideration that the consumable component has been installed; monitoring operation of the floor care equipment; and providing an alert indicating that the consumable component should change.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the information capture system is selected from a list consisting of a camera, an optical signal, an electrical signal, or a radio frequency interface.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the consumable component is a squeegee, a replaceable roller or a brush head.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein a bar code reader is used for the step of scanning of a new consumable component.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the identifier is selected from a list consisting of a barcode, a RFID, a visual image and a QR code.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein the computer is on the floor care equipment, in a cloud computing processor, or on a host device.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein the alert is provided to an operator, the floor care equipment, a cloud computing processor or to a host device.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein the alert is selected from a list consisting of an email, a text message, an audio notification, a tactile vibration, a sound, a phone call and a voice message.
9. The method of claim 1 where the alert can be provided wirelessly to the host system or a mobile device.
10. The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of replacing the worn consumable component with an additional new component.
11. The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of preventing further operation of the floor care equipment until the worn component has been replaced or providing subsequent alerts until the worn component has been replaced.
12. The method of claim 1 wherein the floor care equipment is semi-autonomous.
13. The method of claim 1 wherein the floor care equipment is a floor scrubber system or a vacuum cleaning system.
14. A system of monitoring usage of one or more consumable component of a floor care equipment, the system comprising: a semi-autonomous floor care equipment; a computer processor, mounted on the floor care equipment; a camera, mounted on the floor care equipment; a new consumable component; wherein the computer processor enables the steps of: scanning the new consumable component on the floor care equipment, the new consumable component having at least one unique identifier that is scannable; revising a maintenance schedule algorithm on the computer; monitoring operation of the floor care equipment; and providing an alert indicating that the consumable component should be changed.
15. The system of claim 14 wherein the consumable component is a squeegee, a replaceable roller or a brush head.
16. The system of claim 14 wherein a measurement of smoothness of the surface being cleaned or measurement of the overall dirtiness of the floor is used as an input to the maintenance schedule algorithm.
17. The system of claim 14 wherein the unique identifier is selected from a list consisting of a barcode, a RFID and a QR code.
18. The system of claim 14 wherein at least one of the computer and the alert is on either the floor care equipment or on a host device.
19. The system of claim 14 wherein the alert is selected from a listing consisting of an email, a text message, an audio notification, a tactile vibration, a sound, a phone call and a voice message.
20. The method of claim 1 where a sensor on the consumable component is monitored to adjust the maintenance schedule algorithm.
