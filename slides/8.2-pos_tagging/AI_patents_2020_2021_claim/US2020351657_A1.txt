SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC AUTHORIZATION OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A system for cryptographic authorization of wireless communications includes a verifying node and configured to receive a transfer request from a user device, authenticate the transfer request, generate a transfer authorization token, and provide the transfer authorization token to at least one recipient device.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of cryptographic authorization of wireless communications, the method comprising: receiving, at a verifying node, a transfer request from a user device; authenticating, by the verifying node, the transfer request; generating, by the verifying node, a transfer authorization token; and providing, by the verifying node, the transfer authorization token to at least one recipient device.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein receiving the transfer request further comprises: receiving a cryptographic proof from the user device; and cryptographically verifying the cryptographic proof.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein authenticating further comprises comparing the transfer request from the user device to a revocation listing.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein authenticating further comprises comparing the transfer request from the user device to an authentication listing.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein authenticating further comprises determining a location of the user device.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein authenticating further comprises determining, by the verifying node, at least a heuristic of trust as a function of the at least a transfer request from the user device.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the transfer authorization token further comprises: associating, the transfer request from the user with at least an authorization datum; digitally signing the authorization datum; and generating the transfer authorization token containing the digitally authorization datum.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the transfer authorization token includes recipient device information.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein generating the authorization token includes associating a temporal attribute with the transfer authorization token.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein providing the transfer authorization token further comprises incorporating the transfer authorization token in an instance of an authentication listing.
11. A system for cryptographic authorization of wireless communications, the system comprising a verifying node and configured to: receive a transfer request from a user device; authenticating the transfer request; generating a transfer authorization token; and providing the transfer authorization token to at least one recipient device.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the verifying node is further configured to receive the transfer request by: receiving a cryptographic proof from the user device; and cryptographically verifying the cryptographic proof.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the verifying node is further configured to authenticate by comparing the transfer request from the user device to a revocation listing.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the verifying node is further configured to authenticate by comparing the transfer request from the user device to an authentication listing.
15. The system of claim 11, wherein the verifying node is further configured to authenticate by determining a location of the user device.
16. The system of claim 11, wherein the verifying node is further configured to authenticate by determining, by the verifying node, at least a heuristic of trust as a function of the at least a transfer request from the user device.
17. The system of claim 11, wherein the verifying node is further configured to generate the transfer authorization token by: associating, the transfer request from the user with at least an authorization datum; digitally signing the authorization datum; and generating the transfer authorization token containing the digitally authorization datum.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the transfer authorization token includes recipient device information.
19. The system of claim 17, wherein generating the authorization token includes associating a temporal attribute with the transfer authorization token.
20. The system of claim 11, wherein the verifying node is further configured to provide the transfer authorization token by incorporating the transfer authorization token in an instance of an authentication listing.
