METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR IMPROVING VEHICLE MOTIVE POWER SOURCE STOP/START CONTROL VIA MACHINE LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems are presented for improving engaging automatic vehicle motive power source stopping and inhibiting automatic vehicle motive power source stopping. The methods and systems include processing driver inputs in a machine learning model and characterizing the driver in one of a plurality of driver groups. Automatic vehicle motive power source stopping and starting may be adjusted responsive to a group in which a driver is a member.

<claims>
1. A vehicle motive power source operating method, comprising: identifying present operating conditions of a vehicle via a controller responsive to a combination of data provided via a camera and data provided via a range sensing device; assigning a human driver to one of a plurality of driver groups via a trained machine learning model; and automatically stopping a vehicle motive power source via the controller responsive to the human driver being assigned to a group included in the plurality of driver groups and the present operating conditions.
2. The method of claim 1, where identifying present vehicle operating conditions includes identifying that the vehicle is at a vehicle rental facility and stopped for exit processing, and further comprising: automatically stopping the vehicle motive power source in further response to vehicle motive power source temperature being less than a threshold temperature; and maintaining the vehicle motive power source automatically stopped for longer than a threshold time duration in response to identifying that the vehicle is at the vehicle rental facility.
3. The method of claim 1, where the plurality of driver groups includes a fuel saving group, a performance group, and an intermediate group.
4. The method of claim 1, where identifying present vehicle operating conditions includes identifying that the vehicle is in a predefined parking location, and further comprising: not automatically starting the vehicle motive power source after automatically stopping the vehicle motive power source in further response to a human driver shifting a transmission to park and releasing a brake pedal.
5. The method of claim 4, where the parking location is parking space in a parking garage.
6. The method of claim 4, where the parking location is a delivery zone of a road.
7. The method of claim 4, further comprising not automatically stopping the vehicle motive power source via the controller responsive to the human driver being assigned to the group included in the plurality of driver groups and the present vehicle operating conditions when the camera or the range sensing device is degraded.
8. A vehicle motive power source operating method, comprising: identifying present vehicle operating conditions of a vehicle via a controller responsive to a combination of data provided via a camera and data provided via a range sensing device; assigning a human driver to one of a plurality of driver groups via a trained machine learning model; and inhibiting automatic stopping of a vehicle motive power source via the controller responsive to the human driver being assigned to a group included in the plurality of driver groups and the present vehicle operating conditions.
9. The method of claim 8, where the present vehicle operating conditions include the vehicle being stopped for a traffic signal in a right hand turn lane.
10. The method of claim 9, where the right hand turn lane is a right hand turn only lane.
11. The method of claim 8, where the present vehicle operating conditions include being within a threshold distance of a road toll station.
12. The method of claim 11, where the present vehicle operating conditions include the vehicle being in heavy traffic on a road that moves between vehicle stops at a rate above a threshold frequency.
13. The method of claim 12, where the threshold frequency is greater than 0.3 Hertz.
14. The method of claim 8, where identifying vehicle operating conditions includes performing character recognition on data from a sign.
15. A vehicle motive power source control system, comprising: an internal combustion vehicle motive power source; a distance to object sensing system that transmits a signal and receives a reflected version of the signal; a camera; and a controller including executable instructions stored in non-transitory memory to automatically stop the internal combustion vehicle motive power source or inhibit automatic stopping of the internal combustion vehicle motive power source based on a combination of data from the distance to object sensing system and the camera, and instructions to characterize behavior of a human driver in one of a plurality of groups via a trained machine learning model.
16. The vehicle motive power source system of claim 15, where the vehicle motive power source is automatically stopped via ceasing to flow fuel to the vehicle motive power source.
17. The vehicle motive power source system of claim 15, further comprising additional instructions to inhibit automatically stop the internal combustion vehicle motive power source in response to a vehicle being within a threshold distance of a toll station.
18. The vehicle motive power source system of claim 15, where the one of the plurality of groups is a performance group.
19. The vehicle motive power source system of claim 15, where the one of the plurality of groups is a fuel economy group.
20. The vehicle motive power source system of claim 15, further comprising additional instructions to adjust automatically stopping the internal combustion vehicle motive power source in response to the vehicle being staged for exiting a vehicle rental facility.
