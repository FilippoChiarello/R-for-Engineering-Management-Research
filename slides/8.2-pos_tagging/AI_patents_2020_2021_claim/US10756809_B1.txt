Emergency communication satellite terminal management system
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention discloses an emergency communication satellite terminal management system. In order to improve the information management of emergency satellite phones, the present invention gives full play to the important role of satellite phones in emergency communication, constructs a scientific and reasonable satellite phone management system, and realizes the unified registration, monitoring, management and GIS display for basic information, allocation information, number resource information, operation status and location information of satellite phones and portable satellite stations based on basic requirements of command and dispatch of emergency communication. In case of emergencies, the above management system can provide information resources and decision-making basis for the command department to uniformly dispatch emergency communication resources, so as to improve emergency communication support capability. The main functions of the system include satellite terminal monitoring, satellite terminal management, statistical analysis, GIS display and monitoring, and emergency resource sharing.

<claims>
I claim:
1. An emergency communication satellite terminal management method, comprising: realizing one-stop whole process management of satellite phones and satellite phone number from purchase, warehousing, distribution and return; integrating the emergency resources of satellite communication and public communication, and form a geographic information system (GIS) map, a space-ground integrated, interconnected and sharing three-dimensional emergency communication service support network, thus enhancing the emergency guarantee capability; monitoring the working status and position of satellite terminals in real time, make statistics of the number, frequency, duration of fault terminals and communications by phones, and give alarms of anomaly and cross-border prompts according to the set alarm threshold and resident area, so as to effectively enhance the reliability of satellite terminals, and strengthen emergency guarantee capacity and risk control ability; monitoring the location and status distribution of satellite phones in real time through a GIS map, and conduct track playback and emergency resource query; and analyzing from the different dimensions such as the number, trend, frequency, duration and regional distribution of faults of satellite terminals based on the big data technology.
2. The emergency communication satellite terminal management method of claim 1, further comprising a purchase management, and ex-warehouse and warehousing management of satellite terminals, satellite phone number management, satellite terminal and number distribution, as well as management of return, loss and damage of satellite terminals.
3. The emergency communication satellite terminal management method of claim 1, wherein the sharing the emergency communication resources further comprises storage, sharing and exchange of emergency satellite resources, communication support teams, communication support personnel, communication equipment, emergency command vehicle, network resources and other emergency resources, and adopts unified data interface exchange mode.
4. The emergency communication satellite terminal management method of claim 1, wherein the monitoring further includes giving alarm prompts according to the preset conditions, such as the phone bill exceeding the limit, the use scope of satellite phones, the number of calls, satellite phone faults and other indicator anomalies, and also includes GIS display module to realize the comprehensive display and query function of the location terminal on the map. The main functions include: peripheral analysis, track playback, resource query, query statistics and real-time positioning.
5. The emergency communication satellite terminal management method in claim 1, further comprising business modeling based on the big data platform through the logical regression, linear regression, support vector machine and other algorithms, and the comprehensive analysis of the number, trend and frequency of satellite terminal faults.
6. The emergency communication satellite terminal management method of claim 2, wherein the satellite phone number management includes queries about the call duration and the phone bill of the terminals of satellite phones, including checking the current administrative division, the type of calls, satellite phone number, the number of the other party called, start time, call duration, phone bill and other information.
