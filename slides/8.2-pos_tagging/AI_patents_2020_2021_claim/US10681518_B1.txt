<title>
Batteryless energy harvesting state monitoring device
</title>

<abstract>
A wireless coded communication (WCC) device and method for using the device are provided. In one example, the device includes a wireless chip and a power pump. The power pump is configured to generate power in response a mechanical force applied to an element of the power pump, and the power is transferred to a power storage cell such that the wireless chip is enabled to execute a predefined function. The predefined function is to send code data to an end node over a wireless link. A mechanism is interfaced with the element of the power pump, and the mechanism is configured to move an incidental trigger coupled to the mechanical force. In this example, moving the mechanism transfers the mechanical force onto the element so as to transition the element from an initial state to the strained state, the transitioning from the initial state to the strained state generates the power that is transferred to the power storage cell.
