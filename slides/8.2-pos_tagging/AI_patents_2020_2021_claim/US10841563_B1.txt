<title>
Smart sensor and its system for autonomous system
</title>

<abstract>
This invention relates to a sensor and sensor platform, for an autonomous system. The sensor and its platform sense, perform signal or data processing, and make the decision locally at the point of sensing. More specifically, the sensor along with its platform simulates the human-like or human capacity to make decisions by combing the data from several sensors that detect different data sets, and combine them in a series of data processes that allows autonomous decisions to be made. Additionally, the sensor platform combines multiple sensors in one metasensor with the functionality of multiple sensors placed on a common carrier or platform.
