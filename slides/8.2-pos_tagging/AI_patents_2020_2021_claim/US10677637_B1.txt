<title>
Scale controller with dynamic weight measurement
</title>

<abstract>
A first sensor combined to a first storage carrier for the material for detecting vibrations associated with offloading the material and a second sensor for measuring the weight of the material expelled from the first storage carrier.
</abstract>

<claims>
I claim:
1. A system for measuring the weight of material, the system comprising: a first sensor combined to an unloading apparatus of a first storage carrier of the material for detecting vibrations from the unloading apparatus associated with offloading the material from the first storage carrier; and a second sensor for measuring the weight of the material expelled from the first storage carrier.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the second sensor is a load cell for measuring the weight of the material and wherein the load cell is in communication with a scale controller for recording and storing weight measurements from the load cell.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the scale controller is in communication with the first sensor and wherein the scale controller receives from the first sensor a first signal representative of the initiation of an offload event and in response records a beginning weight of a second storage carrier, and wherein the scale controller receives from the first sensor a second signal representative of the end of an offload event and in response records an ending weight of the second storage carrier for determining the weight of the material deposited from an unloading apparatus of the first storage carrier into the second storage carrier.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the scale controller initiates a tare command to begin weighing the material in response to receiving the first signal, and wherein the scale controller ends the tare command to end weighing the material in response to receiving the second signal.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the first sensor is combined to an exterior of the first storage carrier.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the first sensor detects vibrations of an unloading apparatus and associates the vibrations with the offloading of the material.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the first sensor is one chosen from an accelerometer and an inertial measurement unit.
8. The system of claim 1, and further comprising a processor for comparing signals from the first sensor with stored signals associated with vibrations from the unloading apparatus to determine an initiation of an offload event by the unloading apparatus.
9. A system for measuring the weight of material, the system comprising: a first sensor combined to a first storage carrier of the material for detecting vibrations associated with offloading the material; and a second sensor for measuring the weight of the material expelled from the first storage carrier, wherein the first sensor is on the first storage carrier and the second sensor is on a second storage carrier, wherein the first storage carrier and the second storage carrier are separated from each other with no interconnecting parts.
10. A system for measuring the weight of material, the system comprising: a first sensor combined to a first storage carrier of the material for detecting vibrations associated with offloading the material; a second sensor for measuring the weight of the material expelled from the first storage carrier; and a processor configured to receive and analyze vibrations from the first sensor to determine when offloading of the material has started and ended, and wherein the processor further comprises of a machine learning core, and wherein the processor receives a plurality of time-sequenced signals from the first sensor and determines using the machine learning core whether offloading of the material is in process from a first subset of signals of the plurality of time-sequenced signals from the first sensor as compared to a data set of stored signals representative of offloading of the material being in process.
