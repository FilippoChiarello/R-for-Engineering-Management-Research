<abstract>
A network monitoring device responds to network status data (whether "pushed" from the network device or "pulled" from the network device) to maintain a buffer of saved status data. The network status data is reordered, manipulated, and presented to users of the network monitoring device in order. The monitoring device can provide a status report of the network environment. When network status data is delayed too long, the monitoring device can discard the network status data, or reduce its weighted consideration. The monitoring device attempts to balance accuracy and latency by adjusting wait time for network status data. The monitoring device maintains a record of the amount of network status data it receives and processes from each network device and each network device's ability to provide accurate and complete information to operators and users in a distributed network monitoring environment.

<claims>
1. 1-4. (canceled)
5. A method, including steps of coupling a network monitoring device to a dynamic network environment, the network monitoring device including: (A) a buffer of data entries responsive to status of the network environment and having been reordered from the order they were received, (B) a record of delay associated with the data entries sufficient to determine an amount of weight to give those data entries; dynamically adjusting, by the network monitoring device, at least an amount of weight to give to the data entries responsive to the record of delay, the amount of weight being disposed to balance accuracy and latency of reports on status of the network environment; associating, by the network monitoring device, more or less of the weight to more recent data from the network environment responsive to the record of delay; processing the data entries and the weights associated therewith to provide reports on status of the network environment to an operator of the network monitoring device; including steps of determining a projected accuracy of reports on status of the network environment in response to a rate of receiving information from the network environment, the rate of receiving information being responsive to a statistical measure of experience with data from the network environment.
6. (canceled)
7. The method as in claim 5, including steps of dynamically adjusting one or more of: a sampling rate of data from the dynamic network environment, a size of the buffer, a rate of receiving data from the dynamic network environment, a rate of requesting data from the dynamic network environment, wherein the network monitoring device maintains an amount of data to consider to balance projected accuracy and latency of reports on status of the network environment.
8. The method as in claim 5, including steps of, upon receipt of each said data entry, placing it in a location in the buffer so that their order in the buffer differs from the order they were received.
9. The method as in claim 5, wherein the buffer has a first defined set of data entries having substantially a first amount of weight to give those data entries, and a second defined set of data entries having substantially a second amount of weight to give those data entries.
10. The method as in claim 5, wherein the network monitoring device includes a record of an amount of data it is able to process reliably, the record of an amount of data being sufficient to allow the network monitoring device to balance projected accuracy and latency of reports on status of the network environment.
11. A system including a network monitoring device disposed to be coupled to a dynamic network environment, the network monitoring device including: (A) a buffer of data entries responsive to status of the network environment and having been reordered from the order they were received, (B) a record of delay associated with the data entries sufficient to determine an amount of weight to give those data entries; dynamically adjusting, by the network monitoring device, at least an amount of weight to give to the data entries responsive to the record of delay, the amount of weight being disposed to balance accuracy and latency of reports on status of the network environment; associating, by the network monitoring device, more or less of the weight to more recent data from the network environment responsive to the record of delay; processing the data entries and the weights associated therewith to provide reports on status of the network environment to an operator of the network monitoring device; wherein the network monitoring device is disposed to determine a projected accuracy of reports on status of the network environment in response to a rate of receiving information from the network environment, the rate of receiving information being responsive to a statistical measure of experience with data from the network environment.
12. (canceled)
13. The system as in claim 11, wherein the network monitoring device is disposed to dynamically adjust one or more of: a sampling rate of data from the dynamic network environment, a size of the buffer, a rate of receiving data from the dynamic network environment, a rate of requesting data from the dynamic network environment, wherein the network monitoring device maintains an amount of data to consider to balance projected accuracy and latency of reports on status of the network environment.
14. The system as in claim 11, wherein the network monitoring device is disposed to, upon receipt of each said data entry, place it in a location in the buffer so that their order in the buffer differs from the order they were received.
15. The system as in claim 11, wherein the buffer has a first defined set of data entries having substantially a first amount of weight to give those data entries, and a second defined set of data entries having substantially a second amount of weight to give those data entries.
16. The system as in claim 11, wherein the network monitoring device includes a record of an amount of data it is able to process reliably, the record of an amount of data being sufficient to allow the network monitoring device to balance projected accuracy and latency of reports on status of the network environment.
