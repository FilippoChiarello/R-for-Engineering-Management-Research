METHODS AND DEVICES FOR KNEE SURGERY WITH INERTIAL SENSORS
</title>

<abstract>
A method of navigating a cutting instrument, via a computer system, the method comprising: (a) mounting a patient-specific anatomical mapper (PAM) to a human in a single known location and orientation, where the PAM includes a surface precisely and correctly mating with a human surface correctly in only a single location and orientation; (b) mounting a reference inertial measurement unit (IMU) to the human; (c) operatively coupling a guide to the PAM, where the guide includes an instrument inertial measurement unit (IMU) and at least one of a cutting slot and a pin orifice; (d) outputting data from the reference IMU and the instrument IMU indicative of changes in position and orientation of the guide with respect to the human; (e) repositioning the guide with respect to the human to a position and an orientation consistent with a plan for carrying out at least one of a cut and pin placement; and, (f) visually displaying feedback concerning the position and orientation of the guide with respect to the human using data output from the reference IMU and the instrument IMU, which data is processed by a computer program and the computer program directs the visually displayed feedback.

<claims>
1. A surgical equipment kit for a knee replacement or revision procedure comprising: at least one of (i) a tibial patient-specific anatomical mapper (PAM) that includes a surface precisely and correctly mating with a tibial surface in only a single location and orientation, where the tibial PAM is configured to be mounted to the tibial surface, and (ii) a femoral patient-specific anatomical mapper (PAM) that includes a surface precisely and correctly mating with a femoral surface in only a single location and orientation, where the femoral PAM is configured to be mounted to the femoral surface; a first inertial measurement unit (IMU) having a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and a magnetometer; a second inertial measurement unit (IMU) having a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and a magnetometer; a cutting guide configured to be repositionably coupled to the at least one of the tibial PAM and the femoral PAM, the cutting guide including at least one of a cutting slot and a pin orifice, the guide configured to couple to the first IMU in a predetermined known position and orientation; and a mechanical connection comprising at least two joints to operatively couple the cutting guide to the at least one of the tibial PAM and the femoral PAM; wherein the second IMU is configured to be operatively coupled to the at least one of the tibial PAM and the femoral PAM.
2. The kit of claim 1, wherein the at least two joints comprise at least one of a revolute joint and a spherical joint.
3. The kit of claim 1, wherein the at least two joints comprise a pair of revolute joints and a spherical joint.
4. The kit of claim 1, further comprising an orthopedic implant configured to replace at least a portion of a knee joint.
5. The kit of claim 4, wherein the orthopedic implant comprises a patient-specific implant.
6. The kit of claim 5, wherein the patient-specific implant includes a femoral condyle and a tibial tray insert.
7. The kit of claim 5, wherein the patient-specific implant includes a femoral implant having a pair of condyles and a tibial tray insert having a pair of condyle receivers.
8. The kit of claim 4, wherein the orthopedic implant comprises a mass customized implant.
9. The kit of claim 8, wherein the mass customized implant includes a femoral condyle and a tibial tray insert.
10. The kit of claim 8, wherein the mass customized implant includes a femoral implant having a pair of condyles and a tibial tray insert having a pair of condyle receivers.
11. The kit of claim 4, wherein the orthopedic implant comprises a non-patient-specific implant.
12. The kit of claim 11, wherein the non-patient-specific implant includes a femoral condyle and a tibial tray insert.
13. The kit of claim 11, wherein the non-patient-specific implant includes a femoral implant having a pair of condyles and a tibial tray insert having a pair of condyle receivers.
14. The kit of claim 1, further comprising a reference housing configured to be rigidly mounted to at least one of a tibia and a femur, the reference housing configured to mount to the first IMU correctly in only a single position and orientation.
15. The kit of claim 1, further comprising a 4-in-1 static cutting block.
16. The kit of claim 1, further comprising a 4-in-1 reconfigurable cutting block.
17. The kit of claim 1, further comprising a physical memory device upon which is stored computer readable code that, when executed by a computer, is operative to provide surgical navigation guidance consistent with a pre-operative plan.
18. The kit of claim 1, further comprising a copy of an internet address that may be accessed to provide stored computer readable code that, when executed by a computer, is operative to provide surgical navigation guidance consistent with a pre-operative plan.
19. The kit of claim 1, further comprising a load measuring device configured to couple to the first IMU in a known position and orientation.
20. The kit of claim 19, wherein the load measuring device comprises at least one of a plurality of piezoresistive sensors, a plurality of capacitive sensors, and a plurality of piezoelectric based strain sensors.
21. The kit of claim 1, further comprising an orthopedic implant placement device configured to couple to the second IMU in a known position and orientation.
22. The kit of claim 21, wherein the orthopedic implant placement device is configured to correctly couple to an orthopedic implant in only a predetermined location and orientation.
