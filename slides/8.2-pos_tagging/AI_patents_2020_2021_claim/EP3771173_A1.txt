<title>
REACTIVE AND PRE-EMPTIVE SECURITY SYSTEM FOR THE PROTECTION OF COMPUTER NETWORKS & SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
The invention provides mechanisms for enhancing the security and protection of a computer-based system or network. It relates, in part, to the use of a decoy (which may be termed 'honeypot' or 'honeynet') for collecting attacker-related data, and/or diverting malicious behaviour away from legitimate resources. In one embodiment, the invention provides a method comprising the steps of receiving, processing and logging network traffic data of a plurality of users, where the network traffic is received from a plurality of participating users; determining an attacker profile from the network traffic data; determining a honeypot or honeynet configuration based on the attacker profile; and upon receipt of a valid information request from a user of the plurality of users, providing the determined attacker profile and configuration to the user. Additionally or alternatively, it may provide a computer-implemented method comprising the steps of receiving, processing and logging network traffic data; based on processed network traffic data: determining that network traffic originates from an attacker, determining a risk classification; and determining a decoy configuration based on the risk classification; upon receipt of a valid information request from a user, providing the determined risk classification and decoy configuration to the user.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented security method comprising: based on processed network traffic data: determining that network traffic originates from an attacker; determining a risk classification; and determining a decoy configuration based on the risk classification; and upon receipt of a valid information request from a user, providing the determined risk classification and decoy configuration to the user, wherein determining the risk classification uses supervised learning pattern recognition and wherein the supervised learning pattern recognition comprises using multi-layer perceptrons.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the decoy configuration is based on network traffic data of a plurality of users and is available for use by the plurality of users.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, and comprising the step of using a computer-based resource to store: the network traffic data; an attacker profile; the decoy configuration; and/or data relating to a plurality of users.
4. A method according to any preceding claim, and comprising the step of:
directing network traffic to a honeypot or honeynet generated in accordance with, or using, the determined decoy configuration.
5. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the user is designated as authorised or a legitimate user.
6. A method according to any preceding claim , and comprising the step of:
receiving another request from the user, and determining whether the request is from an authorised user.
7. A method according to any preceding claim, further comprising the step:
determining a profile for the user.
8. A computer implemented security system arranged to implement the method of any preceding claim, comprising: a computer-based storage resource, arranged to store network traffic data provided by a plurality of users of the system; and a software component arranged to provide the decoy configuration to one or more legitimate users upon request, wherein the configuration is based upon an attacker profile that based upon, or derived using, the network traffic data.
9. A system according to claim 8, wherein the storage resource is also arranged to store: profile(s) relating to one or more of a plurality of users; profile(s) relating to one or more attackers or groups or types of attacker; and/or decoy configuration parameters.
10. The method of any preceding claim, and further comprising the step of:
directing traffic to a computer decoy.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising the step of:
storing attacker profile information for the attacker in a computer-based resource.
12. A method according to claim 11, wherein the attacker profile information is generated using network traffic data provided by a plurality of users.
13. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the risk classification indicates a local network risk of failure.
