<title>
Method and device for data mining on compressed data vectors
</title>

<abstract>
A method for data mining on compressed data vectors by a certain metric being expressible as a function of the Euclidean distance is suggested. In a first step, for each compressed data vector, positions and values of such coefficients having the largest energy in the compressed data vector are stored. In a second step, for each compressed data vector, the coefficients having not the largest energy in the compressed data vector are discarded. In a third step, for each compressed data vector, a compression error is determined in dependence on the discarded coefficients in the compressed data vector. In a fourth step, at least one of an upper and a lower bound for the certain metric is retrieved in dependence on the stored positions and the stored values of the coefficients having the largest energy and the determined compression errors.
