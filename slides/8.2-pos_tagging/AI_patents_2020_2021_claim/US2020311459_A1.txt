TRAINING LANGUAGE MODELS USING TEXT CORPORA COMPRISING REALISTIC OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION (OCR) ERRORS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for generating text corpora comprising realistic optical character recognition (OCR) errors and training language models using the text corpora are provided. An example method comprises: generating, by a computer system, an initial set of images based on an input text corpus comprising text; overlaying, by the computer system, one or more simulated defects over the initial set of images to generate an augmented set of images; generating an output text corpus based on the augmented set of image; and training, using the output text corpus, a language model for optical character recognition.

8. The method of claim 5, wherein determining the one or more characteristics of the simulated defects comprises selecting a number of the simulated defects to be overlaid onto one or more of the initial set of images.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising varying a number of realistic optical character recognition errors in the output text corpora for learning a plurality of language models, wherein the realistic OCR errors comprise context-dependent information.
10. The method of claim 4, wherein modifying one or more portions of the image of the initial set of images based on the one or more characteristics of the simulated defects comprises: adjusting values of one or more pixels in the image of the initial set of images based on the characteristics of the simulated defects.
