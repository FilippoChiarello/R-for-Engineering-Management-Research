<title>
ADAPTIVE ANOMALY DETECTION FOR COMPUTER SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
Feature vectors are abstracted from data describing application processes. The feature vectors are grouped to define non-anomalous clusters of feature vectors corresponding to normal application behavior. Subsequent feature vectors are considered anomalous if they do not fall within one of the non-anomalous clusters; alerts are issued for anomalous feature vectors. In addition, the subsequent feature vectors may be used to regroup feature vectors to adapt to changes in what constitutes normal application behavior.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: collecting first process data describing application processes; extracting first feature vectors from the process data; grouping the feature vectors to define or re-define non-anomalous clusters of feature vectors; collecting next process data describing application processes; extracting next feature vectors from the next process data; determining whether or not a next feature vector is within at least one of the non-anomalous clusters; and in response to a determination that the next feature vector is not within at least one of the non-anomalous clusters, issuing an alert.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein: each feature represents a respective process instance, each feature vector associating with each of plural process features a true value or a false value, each true value indicating that the respective process data indicates that the respective feature has been present in the respective process instance, each false value indicating that the respective process data indicates that the respective feature has not been present in the respective process instance; and the non-anomalous clusters include respective centroids, each centroid associating with each of the plural process features a true value or a false value.
3. The method of claim 2 further comprising subset match filtering the next feature vectors to eliminate false positives, the filtering including filtering out feature vectors for which at least one of the centroids associates true values with every process feature with which the feature vector associates a true value so that the determining applies only to feature vectors for which there is no non-anomalous cluster with a centroid that associates true values with every process feature with which that feature vector associates a true value.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein the clusters are redefined more than once to adapt to changes in the normal behavior of an application.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the grouping re-defines existing clusters and the re-defining involves attributing greater weight to more-recent feature vectors than to less-recent feature vectors that are given a non-zero weight.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein the grouping uses an X-means algorithm to define or re-define the clusters.
7. A system comprising non-transitory media encoded with code that, when executed by a processor, implements a method including: collecting first process data describing application processes; extracting first feature vectors from the process data; grouping the feature vectors to define or re-define non-anomalous clusters of feature vectors; collecting next process data describing application processes; extracting next feature vectors from the next process data; determining whether or not a next feature vector is within at least one of the non-anomalous clusters; and in response to a determination that the next feature vector is not within at least one of the non-anomalous clusters, issuing an alert.
8. The system of claim 7 wherein: each feature represents a respective process instance, each feature vector associating with each of plural process features a true value or a false value, each true value indicating that the respective process data indicates that the respective feature has been present in the respective process instance, each false value indicating that the respective process data indicates that the respective feature has not been present in the respective process instance; and the non-anomalous clusters include respective centroids, each centroid associating with each of the plural process features a true value or a false value.
9. The system of claim 8 wherein the method further includes subset match filtering the next feature vectors to eliminate false positives, the filtering including filtering out feature vectors for which at least one of the centroids associates true values with every process feature with which the feature vector associates a true value so that the determining applies only to feature vectors for which there is no non-anomalous cluster with a centroid that associates true values with every process feature with which that feature vector associates a true value.
10. The system of claim 8 wherein the clusters are redefined more than once to adapt to changes in the normal behavior of an application.
11. The method of claim 7 wherein the grouping re-defines existing clusters and the re-defining involves attributing greater weight to more-recent feature vectors than to less-recent feature vectors that are given a non-zero weight.
12. The method of claim 7 wherein the grouping uses an X-means algorithm to define or re-define the clusters.
