METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR ASSISTING GAME-PLAY OF A USER USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)
</title>

<abstract>
The invention provides a method and system for assisting game-play of a user. The method and system includes a training module to train an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based learning model based on a plurality of offline features and a plurality of online features. The plurality of offline features are extracted from one or more of data collected by one or more game developers, a plurality of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and a plurality of replay files associated with game-play. On the other hand, the plurality of online features are extracted from a screen state of the user. Further, the method and system includes a coaching module to coach the user in game-play utilizing the AI-based learning model using techniques such as, but not limited to, statistics, post-game analysis and progress tracking of game-play for optimizing the performance of the user, and generates one or more game-play suggestions for the user.
