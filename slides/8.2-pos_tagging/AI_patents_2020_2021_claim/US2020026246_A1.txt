CONTROL DEVICE AND CONTROL SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a control device that prevents the occurrence of an abnormality in control using artificial intelligence in the case where an abnormality occurs in another terminal that performs the control using the artificial intelligence. A control means (a first control unit) performs the control using artificial intelligence. The control means (second control unit) performs control different from the artificial intelligence. A control switching unit (a switching determination means, a switch) is configured to, when another terminal having the control means (the first control unit) is normal, cause the own control means (the first control unit) to perform the control using artificial intelligence, and when an abnormality occurs in another terminal having the control means (the first control unit), cause the control means (the second control unit) to perform the control different from artificial intelligence.

<claims>
1. A control device comprising: a first control unit that performs control using artificial intelligence; a second control unit that performs control different from the artificial intelligence; and a control switching unit that, when another terminal having the first control unit is normal, causes the own first control unit to perform the control using the artificial intelligence, and when an abnormality occurs in another terminal having the first control unit, causes the second control unit to perform the control different from the artificial intelligence.
2. The control device according to claim 1, comprising a reception unit that receives an abnormality notification indicating an abnormality in the other terminal, wherein the control switching unit is configured to, when the abnormality notification is not received, cause the first control unit to perform the control using the artificial intelligence, and when the abnormality notification is received, cause the second control unit to perform the control different from the artificial intelligence.
3. The control device according to claim 2, wherein the first control unit learns control parameter values indicating parameters of a function for determining an output value of the control using the artificial intelligence from an input value of the control using the artificial intelligence, and calculates the output value based on the input value and the learned control parameter values.
4. The control device according to claim 3, wherein the control using the artificial intelligence is control using machine learning.
5. The control device according to claim 1, wherein the control different from the artificial intelligence is PID control or manual control.
6. The control device according to claim 3, comprising an abnormality detection unit that, when a state in which at least one of the control parameter values is not within a predetermined range lasts for a predetermined time, determines that the first control unit is abnormal, wherein the control switching unit is configured to, when the abnormality notification is not received and it is not determined that the first control unit is abnormal, cause the first control unit to perform the control using the artificial intelligence, and when the abnormality notification is received or it is determined that the first control unit is abnormal, cause the second control unit to perform the control different from the artificial intelligence.
7. The control device according to claim 3, comprising a storage unit that stores the control parameter values learned by the first control unit, wherein the reception unit receives the control parameter values learned by the server, and the first control unit updates the control parameter values stored in the storage unit to the control parameter values learned by the server in a period during which the second control unit performs the control different from the artificial intelligence.
8. The control device according to claim 7, wherein the control switching unit switches from the control different from the artificial intelligence to the control using the artificial intelligence after the updating of the control parameter values.
9. The control device according to claim 6, comprising a transmission unit that, when it is determined that the first control unit is abnormal, transmits the abnormality notification.
10. The control device according to claim 1, wherein a target of the control using the artificial intelligence and the control different from the artificial intelligence is a machine.
11. The control device according to claim 10, wherein the machine is a robot, an autonomous vehicle, or a flying object.
12. A control system comprising a plurality of terminals and a server having the same configuration as the control device according to claim 9, wherein the abnormality notification is provided via the server to the terminals in which it is not determined that the first control unit is abnormal.
13. A control system including a plurality of terminals having the same configuration as the control device according to claim 9, wherein the abnormality notification is provided through inter-terminal communication to the terminals in which it is not determined that the first control unit is abnormal.
14. The control system according to claim 12, wherein the server transmits to all the terminals a switching synchronization flag for synchronizing a timing for switching from the control using the artificial intelligence to the control different from the artificial intelligence, the reception units of the terminals receive the switching synchronization flag, and the control switching units of the terminals are configured to, when the abnormality notification is received and the switching synchronization flag is received, switch from the control using the artificial intelligence to the control different from the artificial intelligence.
15. The control system according to claim 12, wherein the server transmits to all the terminals a period signal indicating a periodic signal, the reception units of the terminals receive the period signal, and the control switching units of the terminals are configured to, even when the period signal is not received, switch from the control using the artificial intelligence to the control different from the artificial intelligence.
