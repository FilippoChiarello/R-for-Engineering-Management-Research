<title>
Navigating a vehicle based on a detected barrier
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided for navigating an autonomous vehicle. In one implementation, a system for navigating a vehicle includes at least one processing device programmed to receive, from an image capture device, a plurality of images associated with an environment of the vehicle, analyze at least one of the plurality of images to identify a navigable region in the environment of the vehicle, identify, based on the at least one of the plurality of images, at least one barrier associated with an edge of the navigable region, and determine a type of the at least one barrier. The at least one processing device is also programmed to determine a navigational path of the vehicle based on the determined type of the at least one barrier, and cause the vehicle to travel on at least a portion of the determined navigational path.

<claims>
1. A system for navigating a vehicle, the system comprising: at least one processor programmed to: receive, from an image capture device, a plurality of images associated with an environment of the vehicle; analyze at least one of the plurality of images to identify a navigable region in the environment of the vehicle; identify, based on the at least one of the plurality of images, at least one barrier associated with an edge of the navigable region; determine that the at least one barrier is a traversable barrier; determine a navigational path of the vehicle that includes traveling through at least a portion of the traversable barrier; and cause the vehicle to travel on at least a portion of the determined navigational path.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is further programmed to identify, based on analysis of at least one of the plurality of images, an obstacle forward of the vehicle, and the determined navigational path of the vehicle avoids the identified obstacle.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the obstacle includes a pedestrian.
4. The system of claim 2, wherein the obstacle includes another vehicle.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the traversable barrier includes a curb or a lane marking.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is programmed to identify a type of the at least one barrier.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the at least one processor is further programmed to determine whether to transmit to a remote server an update to a map for autonomous vehicle navigation based on a determined type of the barrier.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the determined type of the barrier includes a fixed barrier, and the at least one processor is further programmed to transmit a location of the fixed barrier to the remote server.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the fixed barrier includes at least one of a road edge, a curb, a lane dividing structure, a tunnel wall, or a bridge structure.
10. The system of claim 7, wherein the determined type of the barrier includes a movable barrier, and the at least one processor is further programmed to determine not to transmit an update to the remote server.
11. A method for navigating a vehicle, the method comprising: receiving, from an image capture device, a plurality of images associated with an environment of the vehicle; analyzing at least one of the plurality of images to identify a navigable region in the environment of the vehicle; identifying, based on the at least one of the plurality of images, at least one barrier associated with an edge of the navigable region; determining that the at least one barrier is a traversable barrier; determining a navigational path of the vehicle that includes traveling through at least a portion of the traversable barrier; and causing the vehicle to travel on at least a portion of the determined navigational path.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising: identifying, based on analysis of at least one of the plurality of images, an obstacle forward of the vehicle, and the determined navigational path of the vehicle avoids the identified obstacle.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the obstacle includes a pedestrian.
14. The method of claim 12, wherein the obstacle includes another vehicle.
15. The method of claim 11, wherein the traversable barrier includes a curb or a lane marking.
16. The method of claim 11, further comprising: identifying a type of the at least one barrier.
17. The method of claim 16, further comprising: determining whether to transmit to a remote server an update to a map for autonomous vehicle navigation based on a determined type of the barrier.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the determined type of the barrier includes a fixed barrier, and the method further comprises transmitting a location of the fixed barrier to the remote server.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the fixed barrier includes at least one of a road edge, a curb, a lane dividing structure, a tunnel wall, or a bridge structure.
20. The method of claim 17, wherein the determined type of the barrier includes a movable barrier, and the method further comprises determining not to transmit an update to the remote server.
