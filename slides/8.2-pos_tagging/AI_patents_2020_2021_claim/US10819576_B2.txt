<title>
Enforcing policies in cloud domains with different application nomenclatures
</title>

<abstract>
A device receives policy information indicating a policy to be implemented for an application hosted by multiple cloud domains, and receives, from the multiple cloud domains, different application resource tags and addresses associated with the application. The device maps the different application resource tags to a generic identifier, and associates the policy with the generic identifier and with the addresses associated with the application. The device provides, based on associating the policy with the generic identifier and with the addresses associated with the application, the policy to the multiple cloud domains to permit the multiple cloud domains to implement the policy.
