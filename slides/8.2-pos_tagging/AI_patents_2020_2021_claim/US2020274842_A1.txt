ADAPTIVE NOTIFICATION
</title>

<abstract>
For adaptive notification, a processor determines a message sentiment of a message. The processor further determines a sender relationship of a sender of the message to a recipient. The processor determines a notification urgency for the message to the recipient from a notification model based on the message sentiment and the sender relationship. The processor communicates a notification of the message to the recipient based on the notification urgency.

<claims>
1. An apparatus comprising: a processor; a memory that stores code executable by the processor to: determine a message sentiment of a message; determine a sender relationship of a sender of the message to a recipient based on a message frequency calculated as a function of reply messages; determine a notification urgency for the message to the recipient based on a notification model based on the message sentiment and the sender relationship; and communicate a notification of the message to the recipient based on the notification urgency.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the notification model is a neural network recursively trained with the message sentiment, the sender relationship, and an urgency feedback.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the notification model scores the message sentiment and the sender relationship and calculates the notification urgency as a function of the message sentiment and the sender relationship.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the notification urgency specifies one or more of an alert volume, an alert tone, an alert tune, an alert duration, a vibration intensity, and a vibration duration.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the message frequency is further calculated as a function of messages between the sender and the recipient.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the code is further executable by the processor to determine a recipient situation, wherein the notification model is further based on the recipient situation. (Original) The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the recipient situation comprises one or more of a recipient location, a recipient action, a time frame, and a recipient status.
8. A method comprising: determining, by use of a processor, a message sentiment of a message; determining a sender relationship of a sender of the message to a recipient based on a message frequency calculated as a function of reply messages; determining a notification urgency for the message to the recipient based on a notification model based on the message sentiment and the sender relationship; and communicating a notification of the message to the recipient based on the notification urgency.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the notification model is a neural network recursively trained with the message sentiment, the sender relationship, and an urgency feedback.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the notification model scores the message sentiment and the sender relationship and calculates the notification urgency as a function of the message sentiment and the sender relationship.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein the notification urgency specifies one or more of an alert volume, an alert tone, an alert tune, an alert duration, a vibration intensity, and a vibration duration.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the message frequency is further calculated as a function of messages between the sender and the recipient.
13. The method of claim 8, the method further comprising determining a recipient situation, wherein the notification model is further based on the recipient situation.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the recipient situation comprises one or more of a recipient location, a recipient action, a time frame, and a recipient status.
15. A program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable storage medium that stores code executable by a processor, the executable code comprising code to: determine a message sentiment of a message; determine a sender relationship of a sender of the message to a recipient based on a message frequency calculated as a function of reply messages; determine a notification urgency for the message to the recipient based on a notification model based on the message sentiment and the sender relationship; and communicate a notification of the message to the recipient based on the notification urgency.
16. The program product of claim 15, wherein the notification model is a neural network recursively trained with the message sentiment, the sender relationship, and an urgency feedback.
17. The program product of claim 15, wherein the notification model scores the message sentiment and the sender relationship and calculates the notification urgency as a function of the message sentiment and the sender relationship.
18. The program product of claim 15, wherein the notification urgency specifies one or more of an alert volume, an alert tone, an alert tune, an alert duration, a vibration intensity, and a vibration duration.
19. The program product of claim 15, wherein the message frequency is further calculated as a function of messages between the sender and the recipient.
20. The program product of claim 15, wherein the code is further executable by the processor to determine a recipient situation, wherein the notification model is further based on the recipient situation.
