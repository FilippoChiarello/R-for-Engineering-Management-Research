SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR EVALUATING A SCHEDULING STRATEGY ASSOCIATED WITH DESIGNATED DRIVING SERVICES
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for scheduling service of an on-demand service. The systems may perform the methods to obtain historical service information of the on-demand service associated with a target region; determine a scheduling strategy to schedule service providers to the target region based on the historical service information; determine estimated service information associated with the target region based on the scheduling strategy and the historical service information; determine that the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than the historical service information; and store the scheduling strategy in at least one storage medium.

<claims>
1. A system, comprising: at least one storage medium including a set of instructions for scheduling service of an on-demand service; and at least one processor in communication with the at least one storage medium, wherein when executing the set of instructions, the at least one processor is configured to cause the system to: obtain historical service information of the on-demand service associated with a target region; determine a scheduling strategy to schedule service providers to the target region based on the historical service information; determine estimated service information associated with the target region based on the scheduling strategy and the historical service information; determine whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than a service providing condition of the historical service information; and store the scheduling strategy in the at least one storage medium in response to a determination that the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than the service providing condition of the historical service information.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the historical service information includes: count of cancelled historical service requests in the target region, count of historical service requests with no response in the target region, or count of completed historical service requests in the target region.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the estimated service information includes: a simulated count of cancelled service requests in the target region, a simulated count of service requests with no response in the target region, or a simulated count of completed service requests in the target region.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein to determine whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than a service providing condition of the historical service information, the at least one processor is further configured to cause the system to determine at least one of: a first difference between the simulated count of cancelled service requests and the count of historical cancelled service requests, a second difference between the simulated count of service requests with no response and the count of historical service requests with no response, or a third difference between the simulated count of completed service requests and the count of completed historical service requests.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein to determine whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than a service providing condition of the historical service information, the at least one processor is further configured to cause the system to: determine a weighted value of at least two of the first difference, the second difference, or the third difference; and determine whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than the service providing condition of the historical service information based on the weighted value.
6. The system of claim 4, wherein to determine whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than a service providing condition of the historical service information, the at least one processor is further configured to cause the system to: rank at least two of the first difference, the second difference, or the third difference; select one of the ranked at least two of the first difference, the second difference, or the third difference; and determine whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than the service providing condition of the historical service information based on the selected one of the first difference, the second difference, or the third difference.
7. The system of claim 3, wherein to determine whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than a service providing condition of the historical service information, the at least one processor is further configured to cause the system to: determine whether the simulated count of cancelled service requests is less than the count of cancelled historical service requests; and in response to the determination that the simulated count of cancelled service requests is less than the count of cancelled historical service requests, determine that the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than the service providing condition of the historical service information.
8. The system of claim 3, wherein to determine whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than a service providing condition of the historical service information, the at least one processor is further configured to cause the system to: determine whether the simulated count of service requests with no response is less than the count of historical service requests with no response; and in response to the determination that the simulated count of service requests with no response is less than the count of historical service requests with no response, determine that the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than the service providing condition of the historical service information.
9. The system of claim 3, wherein to determine whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than a service providing condition of the historical service information, the at least one processor is further configured to cause the system to: determine whether the simulated count of completed service requests is larger than the count of completed historical service requests; and in response to the determination that the simulated count of completed service requests is larger than the count of completed historical service requests, determine that the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than the service providing condition of the historical service information.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the on-demand service is a designated driving service that allows a service requestor to designate a service provider online, so that the service provider could come to the service requestor's place and use the service requestor's equipment to provide the service.
11. A method implemented on a computing device having at least one processor, at least one storage medium, and a communication platform connected to a network, the method comprising: obtaining historical service information of the on-demand service associated with a target region; determining a scheduling strategy to schedule service providers to the target region based on the historical service information; determining estimated service information associated with the target region based on the scheduling strategy and the historical service information; determining whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than a service providing condition of the historical service information; and storing the scheduling strategy in the at least one storage medium in response to a determination that the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than the service providing condition of the historical service information.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the historical service information includes: count of cancelled historical service requests in the target region, count of historical service requests with no response in the target region, or count of completed historical service requests in the target region.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the estimated service information includes: a simulated count of cancelled service requests in the target region, a simulated count of service requests with no response in the target region, or a simulated count of completed service requests in the target region.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the determining whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than a service providing condition of the historical service information further comprises determining at least one of: a first difference between the simulated count of cancelled service requests and the count of historical cancelled service requests, a second difference between the simulated count of service requests with no response and the count of historical service requests with no response, or a third difference between the simulated count of completed service requests and the count of completed historical service requests.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the determining whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than a service providing condition of the historical service information further comprises: determining a weighted value of at least two of the first difference, the second difference, or the third difference; and determining whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than the service providing condition of the historical service information based on the weighted value.
16. The method of claim 14, wherein the determining whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than a service providing condition of the historical service information further comprises: ranking at least two of the first difference, the second difference, or the third difference; selecting one of the ranked at least two of the first difference, the second difference, or the third difference; and determining whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than the service providing condition of the historical service information based on the selected one of the first difference, the second difference, or the third difference.
17. The method of claim 13, wherein the determining whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than a service providing condition of the historical service information further comprises: determining whether the simulated count of cancelled service requests is less than the count of cancelled historical service requests; and in response to the determination that the simulated count of cancelled service requests is less than the count of cancelled historical service requests, determining that the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than the service providing condition of the historical service information.
18. The method of claim 13, wherein the determining whether the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than a service providing condition of the historical service information further comprises: determining whether the simulated count of service requests with no response is less than the count of historical service requests with no response; and in response to the determination that the simulated count of service requests with no response is less than the count of historical service requests with no response, determining that the scheduling strategy has a better service providing result than the service providing condition of the historical service information.
