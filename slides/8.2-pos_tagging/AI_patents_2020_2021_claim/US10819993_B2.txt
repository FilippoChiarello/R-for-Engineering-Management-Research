</title>

<abstract>
Provided is a computer-recordable recording medium having stored thereon a video file including artificial intelligence (AI) encoding data, wherein the AI encoding data includes: image data including encoding information of a low resolution image generated by AI down-scaling a high resolution image; and AI data about AI up-scaling of the low resolution image reconstructed according to the image data, wherein the AI data includes: AI target data indicating whether AI up-scaling is to be applied to at least one frame; and AI supplementary data about up-scaling deep neural network (DNN) information used for AI up-scaling of the at least one frame from among a plurality of pieces of pre-set default DNN configuration information, when AI up-scaling is applied to the at least one frame.
</abstract>

<claims>
