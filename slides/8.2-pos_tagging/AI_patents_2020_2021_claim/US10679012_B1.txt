<title>
Techniques to add smart device information to machine learning for increased context
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are an apparatus, a system and a non-transitory computer readable medium that implement processing circuitry that receives non-dialog information from a smart device and determines a data type of data in the received non-dialog information. Based on the determined data type, the processing circuitry transforms the received first data using an input from a machine learning algorithm into transformed data. The transformed data is standardized data that is palatable for machine learning algorithms such as those used implemented as chatbots. The standardized transformed data is useful for training multiple different chatbot systems and enables the typically underutilized non-dialog information to be used to as training input to improve context and conversation flow between a chatbot and a user.
