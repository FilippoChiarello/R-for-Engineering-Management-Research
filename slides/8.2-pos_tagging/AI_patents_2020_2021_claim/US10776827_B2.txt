2. The system of claim 1, wherein the notification includes a product advertisement sold in the business of which the user is within the predetermined proximity, the notification being based on a remarketing of the plurality of advertisements previously viewed by the user.
3. The system of claim 1, further comprising a list collecting circuit configured to combine into a combined ranked list the plurality of ranked lists of advertisements aggregately ranked across all of the content-serving devices such that the focus level of the user for the advertisements is included in the combined ranked list.
4. The system of claim 1, further comprising a list collecting circuit configured to combine into a combined ranked list the plurality of ranked lists of advertisements aggregately ranked across all of the content-serving devices such that the focus level of the user for the advertisements, regardless of the content-serving device that displayed the advertisements, is included in the combined ranked list.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the content-serving devices include a medium that displays an advertisement.
6. A location-based advertisement method, comprising: tracking a gaze of a user relative to a plurality of advertisements displayed on different types of content-serving devices both owned by the user and owned by a third party by combining an intra-device gaze of a gaze history of saccades and regressions by the user relative to the user owned device and the gaze of the viewer relative to the third party device together to determine a focus level of the user with respect to each of the plurality of advertisements; creating a plurality of ranked lists ranking the focus level of the user for each of the plurality of advertisements, each of the plurality of ranked lists corresponding to a different content-serving device of the content-serving devices, the plurality of ranked listed being stored in a database; detecting when a user is within a predetermined proximity of a location of a business having products related to the plurality of advertisements displayed on the content-serving devices; sending a notification to the user in a cross-device and a cross-channel scenario based on the user being within the predetermined proximity of the location of the business and the plurality of ranked lists ranking the focus level of the user; remarketing advertisements to the user a second time that were previously advertised to the user in one of the cross-device and the cross-channel scenario on a user device based on the user being within the predetermined proximity of the location of the business and the plurality of ranked lists, wherein, at the second time when the user is viewing content that includes advertisements on the user device and is within the predetermined proximity of the location of the business, the remarketing remarkets the advertisements that tracking detected the focus level for the user on such that the user is remarketed advertisements that the user has already shown interest in thereby advertising to the user at the second time based on a past focus level in the advertisements, wherein the focus level is based on an amount of time that the user has gazed at an advertisement relative to a total amount of time that the tracking has tracked the gaze of the user, wherein each of the ranked lists is ranked in order of a highest focus level for an advertisement with respect to the content-serving device that displayed the advertisements of the ranked list, wherein a highest ranked advertisement on a ranked list of the plurality of ranked lists corresponds to an advertisement that has a highest focus level, wherein the remarketing remarkets the advertisements at a top of the plurality of ranked lists to thereby provide the user with a previously viewed advertisement having a highly ranked focus level on the user device when the user views a medium including advertisement slots, and wherein the database is updated with a result of the remarketing.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the notification comprises a coupon.
8. A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium recording a location-based advertisement program, the program causing a computer to perform: tracking a gaze of a user relative to a plurality of advertisements displayed on different types of content-serving devices both owned by the user and owned by a third party by combining an intra-device gaze of a gaze history of saccades and regressions by the user relative to the user owned device and the gaze of the viewer relative to the third party device together to determine a focus level of the user with respect to each of the plurality of advertisements; creating a plurality of ranked lists ranking the focus level of the user for each of the plurality of advertisements, each of the plurality of ranked lists corresponding to a different content-serving device of the content-serving devices, the plurality of ranked listed being stored in a database; detecting when a user is within a predetermined proximity of a location of a business having products related to the plurality of advertisements displayed on the content-serving devices; sending a notification to the user in a cross-device and a cross-channel scenario based on the user being within the predetermined proximity of the location of the business and the plurality of ranked lists ranking the focus level of the user; remarketing advertisements to the user a second time that were previously advertised to the user in one of the cross-device and the cross-channel scenario on a user device based on the user being within the predetermined proximity of the location of the business and the plurality of ranked lists, wherein, at the second time when the user is viewing content that includes advertisements on the user device and is within the predetermined proximity of the location of the business, the remarketing remarkets the advertisements that tracking detected the focus level for the user on such that the user is remarketed advertisements that the user has already shown interest in thereby advertising to the user at the second time based on a past focus level in the advertisements, wherein the focus level is based on an amount of time that the user has gazed at an advertisement relative to a total amount of time that the tracking has tracked the gaze of the user, wherein each of the ranked lists is ranked in order of a highest focus level for an advertisement with respect to the content-serving device that displayed the advertisements of the ranked list, wherein a highest ranked advertisement on a ranked list of the plurality of ranked lists corresponds to an advertisement that has a highest focus level, wherein the remarketing remarkets the advertisements at a top of the plurality of ranked lists to thereby provide the user with a previously viewed advertisement having a highly ranked focus level on the user device when the user views a medium including advertisement slots, and wherein the database is updated with a result of the remarketing.
