SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTOMATICALLY DETERMINING TO FOLLOW A DIVERGENT VEHICLE IN A VEHICLE'S AUTONOMOUS DRIVING MODE
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for implementing one or more autonomous features for autonomous and semi-autonomous control of one or more vehicles are provided. More specifically, image data may be obtained from an image acquisition device and processed utilizing one or more machine learning models to identify, track, and extract one or more features of the image utilized in decision making processes for providing steering angle and/or acceleration/deceleration input to one or more vehicle controllers. In some instances, techniques may be employed such that the autonomous and semi-autonomous control of a vehicle may change between vehicle follow and lane follow modes. In some instances, at least a portion of the machine learning model may be updated based on one or more conditions.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: entering, by a first vehicle, an autonomous driving mode that follows a second vehicle; determining a change in a second position of the second vehicle while the first vehicle is following the second vehicle; and continuing to follow the second vehicle; and maintaining an association with the second vehicle without matching the change to the second position.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the second position is determined by sensor data of a driving environment associated with the first vehicle, and wherein the sensor data is at least an image of the driving environment.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the second position is determined by drawing a box over the second vehicle in the image.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the box delineates extents of the second vehicle within the image.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein a center of the box is determined.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein to follow the second vehicle, the first vehicle automatically maintains a steering angle to maintain a direction of the first vehicle while a visual location of the second vehicle changes position in subsequent images.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the second vehicle changes lanes and the first vehicle maintains a first position in another lane.
8. The method of claim 6, wherein the second vehicle is in a caravan with the first vehicle.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein determining if an object in the image is a second vehicle comprises identifying the second vehicle as part of the caravan.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the second vehicle is identified by indicia on the second vehicle.
11. A system comprising: a memory; a processor in communication with the memory, wherein the processor executes instructions stored in the memory, which cause the processor to execute a method, the method comprising: entering, by a first vehicle, an autonomous driving mode that follows a second vehicle; determining a change in a second position of the second vehicle while the first vehicle is following the second vehicle; and continuing to follow the second vehicle; and maintaining an association with the second vehicle without matching the change to the second position.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the second position is determined by sensor data of a driving environment associated with the first vehicle, and wherein the sensor data is at least an image of the driving environment.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the second position is determined by drawing a box over the second vehicle in an image of a driving environment, wherein the box delineates extents of the second vehicle within the image, and wherein a center of the box is determined.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein to follow the second vehicle, the first vehicle automatically maintains a steering angle to maintain a direction of the first vehicle while a visual location of the second vehicle changes position in subsequent images of a sensor of the first vehicle.
15. The system of claim 11, wherein the second vehicle changes lanes and the first vehicle maintains a first position in another lane.
16. A non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon instructions, which when executed by a processor cause the processor to execute a method, the method comprising: entering, by a first vehicle, an autonomous driving mode that follows a second vehicle; determining a change in a second position of the second vehicle while the first vehicle is following the second vehicle; and continuing to follow the second vehicle; and maintaining an association with the second vehicle without matching the change to the second position.
17. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, wherein the second position is determined by sensor data of a driving environment associated with the first vehicle, and wherein the sensor data is at least an image of the driving environment.
18. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, wherein the second position is determined by drawing a box over the second vehicle in an image of a driving environment, wherein the box delineates extents of the second vehicle within the image, and wherein a center of the box is determined.
19. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, wherein to follow the second vehicle, the first vehicle automatically maintains a steering angle to maintain a direction of the first vehicle while a visual location of the second vehicle changes position in subsequent images of a sensor of the first vehicle.
20. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, wherein the second vehicle changes lanes and the first vehicle maintains a first position in another lane.
