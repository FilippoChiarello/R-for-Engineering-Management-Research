TRAINING A GENERATOR UNIT AND A DISCRIMINATOR UNIT FOR COLLISION-AWARE TRAJECTORY PREDICTION
</title>

<abstract>
An aspect of the invention describes a system for training a generator unit and a discriminator unit simultaneously, with said generator unit configured to determine a future trajectory of at least one other road in the environment of a vehicle considering an observed trajectory of the at least one other road user, with said discriminator unit configured to determine whether the determined future trajectory of the other road user is an actual future trajectory of the other road user, and with said system configured to train said generator unit and said discriminator unit simultaneously with gradient descent.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system for training a generator unit (GU) and a discriminator unit (DU) simultaneously, • with said generator unit (GU) configured to determine a future trajectory (FT) of at least one other road in the environment of a vehicle considering an observed trajectory (OT) of the at least one other road user, • with said discriminator unit (DU) configured to determine whether the determined future trajectory (FT) of the at least one other road user is an actual future trajectory of the at least one other road user, and • with said system configured to train said generator unit (GU) and said discriminator (DU) unit simultaneously with gradient descent.
2. A system according to claim 1, wherein the other road user is a vulnerable road user, e.g. a pedestrian, a cyclist or an animal.
3. A system according to any of the previous claims, wherein the system comprises an oracle unit (OU), • with said oracle unit (OU) configured to determine a reward for the determined future trajectory (FT) of the at least one other road user considering whether the determined future trajectory (FT) of the other road user is collision-free, and • with said system configured to train said generator unit (GU) considering the reward determined by the oracle unit (OU).
4. A system according to any of the previous claims with said generator unit (GU) configured to determine the future trajectory (FT) of the at least one other road user considering at least one static object (SO) in the environment of the other road user.
5. A system according to claim 4 with said generator unit (GU) configured to determine the future trajectory (FT) of the other road user considering the relative location of the at least one static object (SO).
6. A system according to any of the previous claims with said generator (GU) unit configured to determine the future trajectory (FT) of the other road user considering at least one dynamic object (DO) in the environment of the other road user.
7. A system according to any of the previous claims wherein the generator unit (GU) comprises an encoder unit (EU), with said encoder unit (EU) configured to map an observed trajectory (OT) of the other road user to a common embedding space.
8. A system according to claim 7 wherein the encoder unit (EU) comprises a long short-term memory unit (LSTM).
9. A system according to any of claims 7 or 8 wherein the generator unit (GU) comprises a decoder unit (DU), with said decoder unit (DU) configured to determine the future trajectory (FT) of the other road user considering the common embedding space.
10. A system according to claim 9 wherein the decoder unit (DU) comprises a long short-term memory unit (LSTM).
11. A generator unit (GU) trained by the system according to any of the previous claims.
12. A computer implemented method for training a generator unit (GU) and a discriminator unit (DU) simultaneously, • with said generator unit (GU) configured to determine a future trajectory (FT) of at least one other road user in the environment of a vehicle user considering an observed trajectory (OT) of the at least one other road user, • with said discriminator unit (DU) configured to determine whether the determined future trajectory (FT) of the other road user is an actual future trajectory of the other road user, and • with the method comprising the step of training said generator unit (GU) and said discriminator (DU) unit simultaneously with gradient descent.
