<title>
Item validation and image evaluation system
</title>

<abstract>
Systems for item validation and image evaluation are provided. In some examples, a system may receive an instrument and associated data. The instrument may be received and a user profile may be retrieved. The user profile may include a plurality of previously processed instruments that have been determined to be valid and/or authentic. The instrument may be compared to the plurality of previously processed instruments to determine whether one or more elements of the instrument being evaluated match one or more corresponding elements of the plurality of previously processed instruments. Matching or non-matching elements may be identified. In some examples, one or more user interfaces may be generated displaying the instruments and including any highlighting or enhancements identifying matching or non-matching elements.
