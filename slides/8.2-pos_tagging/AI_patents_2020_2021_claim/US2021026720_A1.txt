OFFLOADING ANOMALY DETECTION FROM SERVER TO HOST
</title>

<abstract>
Some embodiments provide a novel method for collecting and analyzing attributes of data flows associated with machines executing on a plurality of host computers to detect anomalous behavior. In some embodiments, an anomalous behavior is detected for at least one particular flow associated with at least one machine executing on the host computer. In some embodiments, anomaly detection is based on the context data from the guest introspection agent and deep packet inspection. An identifier of the detected anomalous behavior is stored, in some embodiments. The stored attributes are provided, in some embodiments, to a server for further analysis.
</abstract>

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for detecting anomalous behavior of machines executing on a host computer, the method comprising: on the host computer: collecting and storing attributes relating to flows associated with a set of one or more machines executing on the host computer; analyzing the stored attributes to detect an anomalous behavior with at least one particular flow associated with at least one machine executing on the host computer; storing an indication of the anomalous behavior; providing the stored attributes and anomalous-behavior indication to a server for further analysis.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the stored attributes comprise contextual attributes different than layers 2, 3 and 4 flow header values, and the anomalous-behavior indication is provided as a contextual attribute of the particular flow.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the contextual attributes comprise L7 flow header values.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the contextual attributes comprise non-flow header value attributes.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein analyzing the stored attributes comprises analyzing collected contextual attributes to detect the anomalous behavior.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein collecting attributes comprises generating statistics regarding the flows; and analyzing the stored attributes further comprises analyzing the generated statistics to detect the anomalous behavior.
7. The method of claim 2, wherein the stored attributes further comprise statistics generated at the host computer regarding the flows; and analyzing the stored attributes comprises analyzing the generated statistics to detect the anomalous behavior.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein detecting an anomalous behavior comprises determining that a value for a particular statistic attribute of the particular flow has deviated from a stored value for the statistic attribute.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the stored value for the statistic attribute is a mean value, and the stored statistic attributes further comprises a standard deviation for the particular statistic attribute, wherein the standard deviation is used to detect the anomalous behavior.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the statistic attribute is a round trip time.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein analyzing the stored attributes comprises analyzing contextual attributes collected from a deep packet inspection agent to detect the anomalous behavior.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein detecting an anomalous behavior comprises detecting that a port associated with the particular flow does not match a port expected based on an application associated with the particular flow.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein storing the indication of the anomalous behavior comprises storing a contextual attribute associated with the particular flow that is a flag bit that indicates that an anomalous behavior has been detected.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein storing the indication of the anomalous behavior comprises storing a contextual attribute associated with the particular flow that is a value that indicates a particular type of anomalous behavior.
15. The method of claim 1 further comprising taking an action on the host computer based on the detected anomalous behavior.
16. The method of claim 1 further comprising making a recommendation based on the detected anomalous behavior.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the recommendation is to generate a new firewall rule to block the flow in the future.
