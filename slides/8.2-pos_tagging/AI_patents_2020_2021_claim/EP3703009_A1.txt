MOTION STATE EVALUATION SYSTEM, MOTION STATE EVALUATION DEVICE, MOTION STATE EVALUATION SERVER, MOTION STATE EVALUATION METHOD, AND MOTION STATE EVALUATION PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
In a motion state evaluation system 10, a feature estimator 142 estimates a plurality of joint positions of a subject as a plurality of anatomical feature points. A motion analyzer 144 obtains a value representing a motion state of the subject based on a ratio, to a reference length, of a distance between predetermined joints estimated on an image. A reference storage 132 stores a height of the subject as the reference length. A motion analyzer 144 obtains, as a value for use in evaluation of motion of the subject, the value representing the motion state of the subject from a feature point distance on the image of the plurality of anatomical feature points based on a ratio, to the height, of a distance on the image that is determined from the plurality of anatomical feature points and corresponds to the height of the subject. An evaluation processor 146 evaluates the motion of the subject based on the value representing the motion state.
