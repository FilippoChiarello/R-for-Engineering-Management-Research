OPTICAL PHYSICALLY UNCLONABLE FUNCTION DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A physically unclonable function (PUF) device comprises a plurality of optical fibres, at least some of which are arranged such that they are optically coupled. A media surround at least a portion of the optical fibres and at least one light source is configured to transmit light through one or more of the optical fibres. There is provided at least one light sensor configured to receive the transmitted light from one or more of the optical fibres and provide an output. Circuitry applies a challenge signal to at least one of the fibres using at least one light source and receives the output from the at least one light sensor, using the output to generate an identifying response to the challenge signal. The fibres are arranged such that the identifying response is unique to the device.

<claims>
1. A physically unclonable function (PUF) device comprising:
a plurality of optical fibres, at least some of which are arranged such that they are optically coupled;
a media surrounding at least a portion of the optical fibres;
at least one light source configured to transmit light through one or more of the optical fibres;
at least one light sensor configured to receive the transmitted light from one or more of the optical fibres and provide an output; and
circuitry for applying a challenge signal to at least one of the fibres using the at least one light source and for receiving the output from the at least one light sensor to generate an identifying response to the challenge signal, the fibres being arranged such that the identifying response is unique to the device.
2. The PUF device of any preceding claim, wherein the circuitry for applying the challenge signal is arranged to vary the fibres to which the challenge signal is applied and/or the sensors from which the response is received after each challenge is applied to the device.
3. The PUF device of any preceding claim wherein the circuitry for applying the challenge signal is arranged to vary the number of fibres to which the challenge signal is applied and/or the number of sensors from which the response is received after each challenge is applied to the device.
4. The PUF device of any preceding claim, wherein the circuitry is arranged to control at least one of the timing, frequency, amplitude, modulation and phase of the challenge signal.
5. The PUF device of any preceding claim, wherein the circuitry is arranged to apply at least a second challenge signal to at least one of the fibres and to receive at least a second output from at least one of the sensors to generate an identifying response to the challenge signal that is unique to the device.
6. The device of claim 5, wherein the second challenge signal is applied to a different set of fibres than the first challenge signal.
7. The device of claim 5 or claim 6, wherein the second output is received from a different sensor than the first output.
8. The PUF device of any preceding claim, wherein the media is opaque or partly translucent and/or contains a random distribution of particles which modify the coupling between fibres.
9. The PUF device of any preceding claim, wherein the optical fibres are partially covered by a coating.
10. The PUF device of any preceding claim, wherein at least some of the optical fibres are in contact with each other.
11. The PUF device of any preceding claim, wherein the optical fibres are encapsulated within an opaque enclosure.
12. The PUF device of any preceding claim, wherein at least one optical fibre is coupled with itself.
13. A packaged, single-chip, component comprising the device of any preceding claim.
14. A multi-chip module, or system in-package module comprising the device of any of claims 1 to 12.
15. A tamper-proof electronic sub-assembly comprising the device of any of claims 1 to 12.
16. The PUF device, module, or sub-assembly, of any preceding claim wherein the optical receivers, and/or transmitters are encapsulated within the opaque enclosure.
