COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR IN VIVO SCREENING OF THERAPEUTICS
</title>

<abstract>
Provided herein are compositions and methods of use thereof for screening a plurality of uniquely identifiable therapeutic moiety in vivo by identifying one or more reporters indicative of a cell state.
</abstract>

<claims>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method for identifying a candidate therapeutic moiety comprising:
administering to an animal or an organoid a library of expression cassettes comprising:
a plurality of nucleic acid sequences, each encoding a different therapeutic moiety operably linked to a therapeutic moiety barcode; and a plurality of nucleic acid sequences encoding one or more reporters that collectively, when expressed in a cell, are indicative of a cell state or a likelihood of a cell state of the cell; and
identifying a candidate therapeutic moiety that results in a change in a cell state or a likelihood of a cell state of a cell of the animal or the organoid.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the cell state is a healthy cell state, a non-diseased cell state, or a normal cell state.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the change in the cell state or a likelihood of the cell state correlates to a therapeutic effect resulting from the candidate therapeutic moiety.
4. The method of any one of claims 1-3, further comprising enriching or sorting a
population of cells having the change in the cell state or the likelihood of the cell state.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the enriching or sorting comprises enriching or sorting the population of cells based on a level of the one or more reporters.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the enriching or sorting comprises performing FACS, an affinity purification method, flow cytometry, or microfluidic sorting.
7. The method of any one of claims 1-6, wherein the identifying comprises identifying the candidate therapeutic moiety based on a presence of the therapeutic moiety barcode in the cell.
8. The method of any one of claims 7, wherein the identifying comprises performing single cell analysis, RNA sequencing, single cell RNA sequencing, droplet-based single cell RNA sequencing, bulk analysis, or sequencing a population of cells to determine an amount of the candidate therapeutic moiety present in the population of cells.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the identifying comprises single cell RNA sequencing.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the identifying comprises droplet-based single cell RNA sequencing.
11. The method of any one of claims 1-10, wherein the likelihood of the cell state correlates with a level of protein or oligonucleotide expression in the cell.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the level of protein or oligonucleotide expression is measured using a histological or fluorescent staining method.
13. The method of any one of claims 1-12, wherein the different therapeutic moieties are selected from the group consisting of: DNA, RNA, shRNA, siRNA, miRNA, an antisense oligonucleotide, a morpholino, a protein degradation tag, a product of a transgene, a gene editing complex, a Cas fusion protein, CRISPRi, CRISPRa, an RNA editing element, a regulatory element of RNA splicing, an RNA degradation element, an epigenetic modification element, and any combination thereof.
14. The method of any one of claims 1-13, wherein the different therapeutic moieties are product of transgenes.
15. The method of any one of claims 1-13, wherein the different therapeutic moieties are shRNA.
16. The method of any one of claims 1-15, wherein each expression cassette in the library of expression cassettes is packaged in an expression vector.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the expression vector is a virus.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the virus is an adeno-associated virus (AAV), an
adenovirus, or a lentivirus.
19. A candidate therapeutic moiety identified by the method of any one of claims 1-18.
20. An animal or an organoid comprising a plurality of cells, each of the plurality of cells expressing:
a different therapeutic moiety operably linked to a therapeutic moiety barcode; and
one or more reporters that collectively, when expressed in a cell, are indicative of a cell state or a likelihood of a cell state of the cell.
21. The animal or organoid of claim 20, wherein the different therapeutic moieties are
selected from the group consisting of: DNA, RNA, shRNA, a product of a transgene, a gene editing complex, a Cas fusion protein, CRISPRi, CRISPRa, an RNA editing element, siRNA, miRNA, an antisense oligonucleotide, a morpholino, a protein degradation tag, a regulatory element of RNA splicing, an RNA degradation element, an epigenetic modification element, and any combination thereof.
22. The animal or organoid of claim 20 or 21, wherein the animal or the organoid is a disease model.
