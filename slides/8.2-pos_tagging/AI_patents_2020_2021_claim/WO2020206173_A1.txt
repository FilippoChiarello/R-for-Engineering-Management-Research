METHODS AND APPARATUSES FOR COLLECTION AND VISUALIZATION OF ULTRASOUND DATA
</title>

<abstract>
Some aspects of the technology described herein relate to configuring an ultrasound device to perform a three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep, and displaying ultrasound images and segmented portions of the ultrasound images as the ultrasound images are collected during the three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep. Certain aspects relate to displaying an ultrasound image collected by an ultrasound device and configuring the ultrasound device to perform a three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep based on the ultrasound image collected by the ultrasound device.

<claims>
1. An apparatus, comprising:
a processing device in operative communication with an ultrasound device, the processing device configured to:
display an initial ultrasound image collected by the ultrasound device;
configure the ultrasound device to perform a three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep based on the initial ultrasound image collected by the ultrasound device;
display ultrasound images as the ultrasound images are collected during the three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep;
display a cine including the ultrasound images and segmented portions of the ultrasound images that were collected during the three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep; and
display a three-dimensional visualization based on the segmented portions of the ultrasound images that were collected during the three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the ultrasound device is configured to perform the three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep while a user maintains the ultrasound device at approximately a same position and orientation at which the ultrasound device collected the initial ultrasound image.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the ultrasound device is configured to use a twodimensional array of ultrasound transducers on a chip to perform beamforming in order to perform the three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep comprises an elevational sweep.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep comprises a three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep of a bladder.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processing device is configured, when displaying the ultrasound images as the ultrasound images are collected during the threedimensional ultrasound imaging sweep, to display a most recently collected ultrasound image.
7. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processing device is configured, when displaying the ultrasound images as the ultrasound images are collected during the threedimensional ultrasound imaging sweep, to display the ultrasound images in real-time.
8. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processing device is further configured to use a statistical model to generate the segmented portions of the ultrasound images.
9. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the three-dimensional visualization comprises a three-dimensional visualization of a bladder.
10. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the three-dimensional visualization comprises a three-dimensional visualization of a volume of a bladder depicted in the ultrasound images, and wherein the segmented portions of the ultrasound images comprise interiors of the bladder.
11. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processing device is configured, when displaying the three-dimensional visualization, to display an orientation indicator that indicates a position of the ultrasound device relative to a bladder depicted by the threedimensional visualization.
12. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processing device is configured, when displaying the three-dimensional visualization, to display an orientation indicator that indicates a position of a bottom plane of the ultrasound images collected during the threedimensional ultrasound imaging sweep relative to a bladder depicted by the threedimensional visualization.
13. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processing device is further configured to: detect a dragging movement and/or a pinching movement across a touch-sensitive display screen of the processing device; and based on the dragging movement and/or the pinching movement, display the threedimensional visualization as if the three-dimensional visualization were being rotated and/or zoomed in three dimensions.
14. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processing device is further configured to perform a measurement based on the segmented portions of the ultrasound images collected during the three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep.
15. The apparatus of claim 14, wherein the measurement comprises a measurement of a volume of a bladder.
16. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the segmented portions of the ultrasound images comprise interiors of a bladder depicted in the ultrasound images.
17. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein an imaging slice of the initial ultrasound image comprises a center imaging slice of the three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep.
18. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein an imaging slice of the initial ultrasound image comprises an extreme of the three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep.
19. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processing device is further configured to display the segmented portions of the ultrasound images as the ultrasound images are collected during the three-dimensional ultrasound imaging sweep.
20. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processing device comprises a handheld processing device.
