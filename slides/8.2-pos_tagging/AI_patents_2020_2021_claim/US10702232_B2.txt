Systems and methods for detecting complex networks in MRI image data
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for detecting complex networks in MRI image data in accordance with embodiments of the invention are illustrated. One embodiment includes an image processing system, including a processor, a display device connected to the processor, an image capture device connected to the processor, and a memory connected to the processor, the memory containing an image processing application, wherein the image processing application directs the processor to obtain a time-series sequence of image data from the image capture device, identify complex networks within the time-series sequence of image data, and provide the identified complex networks using the display device.
