<title>
VEHICLE PATH PREDICTION
</title>

<abstract>
A system, comprising a computer that includes a processor and a memory, the memory storing instructions executable by the processor to input second vehicle sensor data received via or more of vehicle-to-vehicle (V-to-V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V-to-I) networking into a generative query neural network (GQN) trained to generate second vehicle viewpoint data and predict a path for a second vehicle based on the second vehicle viewpoint data with a reinforcement learning deep neural network (RLDNN). The computer can be further programmed to obtain a confidence for the predicted second vehicle path from a Bayesian framework applied to the RLDNN and determine a first vehicle path based on the predicted second vehicle path and the confidence.

<claims>
1. A computer, comprising a processor; and a memory, the memory including instructions to be executed by the processor to: input second vehicle sensor data received via or more of vehicle-to-vehicle (V-to-V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V-to-I) networking into a generative query neural network (GQN) trained to generate second vehicle viewpoint data; predict a path for a second vehicle based on the second vehicle viewpoint data with a reinforcement learning deep neural network (RLDNN); obtain a confidence for the predicted second vehicle path from a Bayesian framework applied to the RLDNN; and determine a first vehicle path based on the predicted second vehicle path and the confidence.
2. The computer of claim 1, the instructions further including instructions to download a high definition (HD) map data from a cloud-based traffic infrastructure system via V-to-I networking.
3. The computer of claim 2, wherein the instructions further include instructions to fuse the HD map data with the second vehicle viewpoint data by projecting second vehicle viewpoint data onto the HD map data based on a location and a field of view of the second vehicle.
4. The computer of claim 1, the instructions further including instructions to process second vehicle viewpoint data with a second RLDNN to detect moving objects in the second vehicle viewpoint data.
5. The computer of claim 4, the instructions further including instructions to include sensor data acquired by traffic infrastructure video cameras in second vehicle viewpoint data.
6. The computer of claim 1, the instructions further including instructions to predict the path for the second vehicle based on one or more of receiving vehicle sensor data from the second vehicle and determining path data based on processing observations of the second vehicle with the second RLDNN.
7. The computer of claim 1, wherein the Bayesian framework determines the confidence based on a prediction accuracy conditioned on observations of previous output prediction accuracies.
8. The computer of claim 1, the instructions further including instructions to compare the second vehicle viewpoint data to the second vehicle sensor data to determine second vehicle sensor data accuracy.
9. The computer of claim 1, wherein determining the first vehicle path based on the predicted second vehicle path and the confidence includes avoiding collisions and near-collisions.
10. The computer of claim 1, the instructions further including instructions to operate the first vehicle based on the first vehicle path by controlling vehicle powertrain, steering and braking.
11. A method, comprising: inputting second vehicle sensor data received via one or more of vehicle-to-vehicle (V-to-V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V-to-I) networking into a generative query neural network (GQN) trained to generate second vehicle viewpoint data; predicting a path for a second vehicle based on the second vehicle viewpoint data with a reinforcement learning deep neural network (RLDNN); obtaining a confidence for the predicted second vehicle path from a Bayesian framework applied to the RLDNN; and determining a first vehicle path based on the predicted second vehicle path and the confidence.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising downloading a high definition (HD) map data from a cloud-based based traffic infrastructure system via V-to-I networking.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising fusing the HD map data with the second vehicle viewpoint by projecting second vehicle viewpoint data onto the HD map data based on a location and a field of view of the second vehicle.
14. The method of claim 11, further comprising processing second vehicle sensor data with a second RLDNN to detect moving objects in the second vehicle viewpoint data.
15. The method of claim 14, further comprising including sensor data acquired by traffic infrastructure video cameras in second vehicle viewpoint data.
16. The method of claim 11, further comprising predicting the path for the second vehicle based on one or more of receiving vehicle sensor data from the second vehicle and determining path data based on processing observations of the second vehicle with the second RLDNN.
17. The method of claim 11, wherein the Bayesian framework determines the confidence based on a prediction accuracy determined based on observations of previous output prediction accuracies.
18. The method of claim 11, wherein the second vehicle viewpoint data is compared to the second vehicle sensor data to determine second vehicle sensor data accuracy.
19. The method of claim 11, wherein determining a first vehicle path based on the predicted second vehicle path and the confidence includes avoiding collisions and near-collisions.
20. The method of claim 11, further including operating a first vehicle based on the first vehicle path by controlling vehicle powertrain, steering and braking.
