FAILURE DETECTION METHOD FOR AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A fault detection method for an air conditioning system is provided by the present disclosure. The air conditioning system has a liquid pump and an injector. The fault detection method includes: automatically learning to obtain a monotonically decreasing fault detection characteristic curve Y=K(X−XMAX)+A by using an electrical power consumption of the liquid pump and a high-pressure-side pressure of the injector; wherein when Y and A are 0, X corresponds to a maximum high-pressure-side pressure Xmax of the injector; and when the current pressure of the injector Xcurrent≤Xmax: if the current electrical power consumption Ycurrent<K(Xcurrent−Xmax)+A, then a probability of the injector state of the air conditioning system being normal is greater than a first preset value; and if the current electrical power consumption Ycurrent>K(Xcurrent−Xmax)+A, a probability of the injector of the air conditioning system having a fault is greater than a second preset value.
