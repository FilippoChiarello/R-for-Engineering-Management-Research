<title>
RECURSIVE MULTI-FIDELITY BEHAVIOR PREDICTION
</title>

<abstract>
A method for predicting a future action of agents in a scene includes assigning a fidelity level to agents observed in the scene. The method also includes recursively predicting future actions of the agents by traversing the scene. A different forward prediction model is used at each recursion level. The method further includes controlling an action of an ego agent based on the predicted future actions of the agents.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: assigning a fidelity level to agents observed in a scene; recursively predicting future actions of the agents by traversing the scene, a different forward prediction model being used at each recursion level; and controlling an action of an ego agent based on the predicted future actions of the agents.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising assigning a reasoning level and a set of forward prediction models to each agent in the scene.
3. The method of claim 2, in which each forward prediction model of the set of forward prediction models corresponds to a recursion level determined based on the reasoning level.
4. The method of claim 1, in which the future actions are recursively predicted based on an initial trajectory comprising historical observations of each agent.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising partitioning the scene into different neighborhoods.
6. The method of claim 5, in which the fidelity level is assigned to the agents based on a fidelity of a corresponding neighborhood.
7. The method of claim 1, in which the future actions are recursively predicted based on an applicable policy for each agent, and the policy is based on a corresponding neighborhood of the agent and a scene structure.
8. An apparatus comprising: a memory; and at least one processor coupled to the memory, the at least one processor configured: to assign a fidelity level to agents observed in a scene; to recursively predict future actions of the agents by traversing the scene, a different forward prediction model being used at each recursion level; and to control an action of an ego agent based on the predicted future actions of the agents.
