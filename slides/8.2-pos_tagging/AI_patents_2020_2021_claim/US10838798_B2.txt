<title>
Processing system for performing predictive error resolution and dynamic system configuration control
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the disclosure relate to error resolution processing systems with improved error prediction features and enhanced resolution techniques. A computing platform may receive error log files identifying error codes corresponding to error occurrences on one or more different virtual machine host platforms. The computing platform may aggregate the error codes corresponding to the error occurrences to generate an error lattice. Using the error lattice, the computing platform may predict an error outcome. Based on the predicted error outcome, the computing platform may determine a system configuration update to be applied to the one or more virtual machine host platforms. The computing platform may direct a dynamic resource management computing platform to distribute relevant portions of the system configuration update to each of the one or more virtual machine host platforms. This may cause the one or more virtual machine host platforms to implement the system configuration update.
