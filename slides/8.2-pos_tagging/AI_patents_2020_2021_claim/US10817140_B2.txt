</title>

<abstract>
Mechanisms to create and/or use sequential data comprising a plurality of sequences are disclosed. A sequence comprises in a standard format at least a start user interface interaction and possible further user interface interactions between the start user interface interaction and an end event. The sequence may comprise the end event as well. An end event may be a user interface interaction performed when a user has used a creation oriented application or an indication of a maximum time between consecutive user interface interactions expiring.
