AUTOMATED MODEL VALIDATION SYSTEM FOR ELECTRICAL GRID
</title>

<abstract>
Provided is a system and method for automated power system model validation. The system can detect a disturbance on an electrical grid, identify sensors that are near the disturbance, correlate the sensors to a subsystem on the grid, and perform a power system model validation for the subsystem. In one example, the method may include in response to an event on an electrical grid, identifying a PMU of the electrical grid based on a geographical location of the event, mapping the identified PMU to a power generation system on the electrical grid based on a tag of the identified PMU and a tag of the power generation system, retrieving a power system model of the power generation system, and triggering a validation determination of the power system model of the power generation system based on event data sensed by the identified PMU.
