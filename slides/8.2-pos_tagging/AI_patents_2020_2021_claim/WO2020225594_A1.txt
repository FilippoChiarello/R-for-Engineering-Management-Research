SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FORMULATION OF A SECURE DIGITAL CONTRACT
</title>

<abstract>
A system for formulation of a secure digital contract includes a contract processing subsystem. The contract processing subsystem includes a template recommendation module, configured to identify the one or more parameters by an analysing technique and provide a pre-arranged template. The processing subsystem includes a clause customization module, configured to customize plurality of clauses within the pre-arranged template by a customizing technique. The processing subsystem includes a clause reviewing module, configured to review a customized contract according to one or more inputs received from the plurality of registered users. The processing subsystem includes a contract authorization module, configured to authorize the contract after reviewing the plurality of customized clauses of the contract by the securing technique. Present disclosure enables fast and secure formulation of a digital contract.

<claims>
WE CLAIM:
1. A system for formulation of a secure digital contract (10), comprising:
a contract processing subsystem (20), comprising: a registration module (40) configured to receive a plurality of registration details of a plurality of users; a retrieval module (50) operatively couple to the registration module (40), and configured to retrieve one or more parameters from a plurality of registered users; a template recommendation module (60) operatively coupled to the retrieval module (50), and configured to identify the one or more parameters by an analysing technique and provide a pre arranged template; a clause customization module (70) operatively coupled to the template recommendation module (60), and configured to customize plurality of clauses within the pre-arranged template by a customizing technique; a clause reviewing module (80) operatively coupled to the clause customization module (70), and configured to review a customized contract according to one or more inputs received from the plurality of registered users; a contract authorization module (90) operatively coupled to the clause reviewing module (80), and configured to authorize the contract after reviewing the plurality of customized clauses of the contract by the securing technique; and a contract memory subsystem (30) operatively coupled to the contract processing subsystem (20), and configured to store the plurality of registration details of the plurality of users, the one or more parameters, the plurality of the customized clauses, the pre-arranged template, the authorized contract and the contract, wherein the contract memory subsystem is located on a blockchain platform.
2. The system (10) as claimed in claim 1, wherein reviewing the customized contract is performed within a predefined time interval based on the one or more inputs received from the plurality of registered users.
3. The system (10) as claimed in claim 1, wherein further comprising a clause modification module operatively coupled to the clause reviewing module (80), and configured to modify the plurality of generated clauses by a modifying technique within the pre-arranged template based on the one or more inputs received from the plurality of registered users.
4. The method for formulation of a secure digital contract (160), comprising: registering, by a registration module, a plurality of registration details of a plurality of users (170); retrieving, by a retrieval module, one or more parameters from a plurality of registered users (180); identifying, by a template recommendation module, the one or more parameters by an analysing technique (190); recommending, by the template recommendation module, a pre-arranged template based on the identified the one or more parameters (200); customizing, by a clause customization module, the plurality of clauses within the pre-arranged template by a customizing technique (210); reviewing, by a clause reviewing module, a customized contract according to one or more inputs received from the plurality of registered users (220); modifying, by a clause modification module, the plurality of customized clauses by a modifying technique within the pre-arranged template based on one or more inputs received from the plurality of registered users (230); and authorizing, by a contract authorization module, a contract after reviewing the plurality of customized clauses of the contract by the securing technique (240).
5. The method (160) as claimed in claim 4, wherein reviewing, by the clause reviewing module, the customized contract is performed within a predefined time interval based on the one or more inputs received from the plurality of registered users.
6. The method (160) as claimed in claim 4, further comprising storing, by a contract memory subsystem, the plurality of registration details of a plurality of users, the one or more parameters, the plurality of the customized clauses, the pre arranged template, the authorized contract and the contract.
7. The method (160) as claimed in claim 6, wherein storing of the plurality of registration details of a plurality of users, the one or more parameters, the plurality of the customized clauses, the pre-arranged template, the authorized contract and the contract, comprises storing on a blockchain platform.
