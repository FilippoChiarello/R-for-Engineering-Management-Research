METHOD FOR JUDGMENT OF CHEDDAR GRADE BASED ON IDENTIFICATION CHARACTERISTIC FLAVOR COMPOSITION
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention discloses a method for judgment of cheddar cheese grade based on identification characteristic flavor compounds, comprising the following steps: selecting cheddar cheese of different grades as standard product, and extracting volatile flavor compounds from the standard product; using gas phase-sniffing device to screen out characteristic flavor compounds with higher flavor intensity from the volatile flavor compounds through aroma extract dilution analysis; proceeding with clustering of characteristic flavor compounds as screened out to obtain identification characteristic flavor compounds of cheddar cheese; measuring the concentration of identification characteristic flavor composition of cheddar cheese of known grade, and establish the training set for training of support vector machine; measuring the concentration of identification characteristic flavor composition of cheddar cheese to be tested, and inputting it into the support vector machine trained to judge the grade of cheddar cheese to be tested. The present invention aims to obtain the model of identification characteristic flavor compounds of cheddar cheese through statistical analysis, which is available for accurate judgment of cheddar cheese quality grade on this basis.
