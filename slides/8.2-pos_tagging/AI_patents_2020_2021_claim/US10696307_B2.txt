<title>
Anomaly detector for vehicle control signals
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle controller receives sensor outputs and identifies features in the sensor outputs. The controller determines a trajectory based on the features and generates control signals to vehicle actuators to follow the trajectory. Eccentricity of the control signals is evaluated and if it meets a threshold condition is met an intervention is performed such as discarding or modifying the control signal or initiating a safety procedure. Eccentricity may be determined using an unsupervised machine learning model. The threshold condition may be a dynamic threshold condition such as using the n-sigma approach or the Chebyshev inequality.
