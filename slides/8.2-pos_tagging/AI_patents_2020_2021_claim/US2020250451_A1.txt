INFORMATION PROCESSING APPARATUS FOR ANALYZING IMAGE DATA, CONTROL METHOD FOR THE SAME, AND STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
An information processing apparatus capable of communicating with an external device includes an analysis unit configured to analyze image data and acquire a second analysis result using a second inference model that is less accurate than a first inference model of an external device when communication with the external device is not possible, a transmission unit configured to transmit the image data to the external device when communication with the external device is possible, and an acquisition unit configured to acquire, from the external device, a first analysis result obtained by analyzing, using the first inference model, the image data transmitted to the external device by the transmission unit. The first inference model and the second inference model are generated by performing machine learning.
