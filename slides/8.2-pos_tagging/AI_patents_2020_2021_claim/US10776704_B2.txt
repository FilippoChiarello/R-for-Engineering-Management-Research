Method and system for building domain intelligent solution
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system is provided for building domain intelligent solution. The present application provides a method and system for building a domain intelligent solution, comprises of utilizing a language existing as a generic model for capturing intrinsic knowledge pertaining to a technical domain; creating a domain intelligent solution for said technical domain using said language or vocabulary; translating the domain intelligent solution into required wrappers for them to be integrated with a third party technology or tool; and integrating said created domain intelligent solution with the third party technology or tool for providing system engineering capabilities to make them domain intelligent.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for building a domain intelligent solution; said method comprising processor implemented steps of: a. utilizing a language or vocabulary for capturing intrinsic knowledge pertaining to a technical domain using a language utilization module (204); b. creating a domain intelligent solution for the technical domain using said language or vocabulary in a domain intelligent solution creation module (206), wherein creating the domain intelligent solution comprises the steps of: capturing a set of concepts related to the technical domain using a metamodel (302); wherein the metamodel is built using the set of concepts identified as a set of model elements and their interdependencies pertaining to the technical domain; enabling user to populate a domain awareness module (304) with a specified knowledge related to the technical domain in an interactive environment (306); wherein the user populates the specified knowledge related to the technical domain in form of use cases and requirement statements, expressed in said language or vocabulary; providing user assistance through a structured information, using a dependency detection module (308); wherein the user assistance is provided through converting the specified knowledge populated by the user into the structured information by auto detection of a set of potential dependencies of the technical domain related to the specified knowledge, based on the metamodel; and performing verification on the specified knowledge by performing consistency check using a verification module (310); c. translating the domain intelligent solution into required wrappers for them to be integrated with a third party technology or tool using a compiler and translation module (208); and d. integrating said created domain intelligent solution with the third party technology or tool for providing system engineering capabilities to make them domain intelligent using a domain intelligent solution integration module (210).
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the set of concepts related to the technical domain is selected from a group comprising of requirements, design, and testing.
3. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein translating the domain intelligent solution into required wrappers for them to be integrated with the third party technology or tool using the compiler and translation module (208) is done through automatic generation of additional libraries or wrappers.
4. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the domain intelligent solution is retrofitted with the information created using the third party technology or tool.
5. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprises of storing, fetching, enabling versioning, exporting the domain intelligent solution and associate knowledge using a repository (212).
6. A system (200) for building a domain intelligent solution; said system (200) comprising: a processor (202); and a memory coupled to the processor (202), wherein the processor (202) executes a plurality of modules stored in the memory, and wherein the plurality of modules comprises: a language utilization module (204) adapted for utilizing a language or vocabulary for capturing intrinsic knowledge pertaining to a technical domain; a domain intelligent solution creation module (206) adapted for creating a domain intelligent solution for the technical domain using said language or vocabulary in a domain intelligent solution environment (300), wherein the domain intelligent solution environment (300) comprises: a metamodel (302) adapted for capturing a set of concepts related to the technical domain; wherein the metamodel is built using the set of concepts identified as a set of model elements and their interdependencies pertaining to the technical domain; an interactive environment (306) adapted for enabling user to populate a domain awareness module (304) with a specified knowledge related to the technical domain; wherein the user populates the specified knowledge related to the technical domain in form of use cases and requirement statements, expressed in said language or vocabulary; a dependency detection module (308) adapted for providing user assistance through a structured information; wherein the user assistance is provided through converting the knowledge populated by the user into the structured information by auto detection of a set of potential dependencies of the technical domain related to the specified knowledge, based on the metamodel; and a verification module (310) adapted for performing verification on the specified knowledge by performing consistency check; a compiler and translation module (208) adapted for translating the domain intelligent solution into required wrappers for them to be integrated with a third party technology or tool; and a domain intelligent solution integration module (210) adapted for integrating said created domain intelligent solution with the third party technology or tool for providing system engineering capabilities to make them domain intelligent.
7. The system as claimed in claim 6, further comprises of a repository (212) adapted for storing, fetching, enabling versioning, exporting the domain intelligent solution and associate knowledge.
