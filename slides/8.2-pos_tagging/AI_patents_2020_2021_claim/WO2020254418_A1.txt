SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR POPULATING A DATABASE WITH OCCUPANCY DATA OF PARKING FACILITIES
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a system for populating a database with occupancy data of a plurality of parking facilities, the system comprising: computer-readable storage media comprising non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable instructions stored thereon; and a processor configured to execute the computer-readable instructions, wherein the computer-readable instructions, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to: retrieve historical occupancy data for each of the plurality of parking facilities; retrieve a single prediction module from the non-transitory computer-readable storage medium; determine, by the single prediction module, future occupancy data for the plurality of parking facilities based on the historical occupancy data of the plurality of parking facilities; store the future occupancy data in a database in the computer-readable storage media. There is further provided a method for populating a database with occupancy data of a plurality of parking facilities.

Patent claims
1 . A system for generating a database comprising occupancy data of a plurality of parking facilities, the system comprising:
computer-readable storage media comprising non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable instructions stored thereon; and
a processor configured to execute the computer-readable instructions, wherein the computer-readable instructions, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to:
retrieve historical occupancy data for each of the plurality of parking facilities;
retrieve a single prediction module from the non-transitory computer-readable storage medium;
determine, by the single prediction module, future occupancy data for the plurality of parking facilities based on the historical occupancy data of the plurality of parking facilities;
store the future occupancy data in the database in the computer-readable storage media.
2. The system of claim 1 , wherein the prediction module comprises a recurrent neural network.
3. The system of claim 1 or 2, wherein the prediction module comprises a gated recurrent neural network or a long short-term memory neural network.
4. The system of any preceding claim, wherein the computer-readable instructions, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to: separate, by the single prediction module, the future occupancy data into future occupancy data for each of the plurality of parking facilities.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the prediction module further comprises a layer to separate the future occupancy data into future occupancy data for each of the plurality of parking facilities. 6. The system of any preceding claim, wherein the historical occupancy data for each parking facility is retrieved from a remote public database.
7. The system of any preceding claim, wherein the prediction module is retrieved from the non-transitory computer-readable storage medium only once to determine the future occupancy data.
8. The system of any preceding claim, wherein the prediction module comprises a single model. 9. The system of any preceding claim, wherein the future occupancy data is determined for a plurality of parking facilities within an area.
10. A method of generating a database comprising occupancy data of a plurality of parking facilities, the method comprising:
retrieving, by a processor, historical occupancy data for each of the plurality of parking facilities from a computer-readable storage medium; retrieving, by the processor, a single prediction module from a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium;
determining, by the single prediction module, future occupancy data for the plurality of parking facilities based on the historical occupancy data of the plurality of parking facilities;
storing the future occupancy data in the database in the computer-readable storage medium. 1 1. The method of claim 10, wherein the prediction module comprises a recurrent neural network.
12. The method of claim 10 or 11 , wherein the prediction module comprises a gated recurrent neural network or a long short-term memory neural network. 13. The method of any one of claims 10-12, further comprising separating, by the single prediction module, the future occupancy data into future occupancy data for each of the plurality of parking facilities.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the prediction module further comprises a layer to separate the future occupancy data into future occupancy data for each of the plurality of parking facilities. 15. The method of any one of claims 10-14, further comprising retrieving, by the processor, the historical occupancy data for each parking facility from a remote public database prior to storing the historical occupancy data in the computer-readable storage medium. 16. The method of any one of claims 10-15, wherein the prediction module is retrieved from the non-transitory computer-readable storage medium only once to determine the future occupancy data.
17. The method of any one of claims 10-16, wherein the prediction module comprises a single model.
18. The method of any one of claims 10-17, wherein the future occupancy data is determined for a plurality of parking facilities within an area.
