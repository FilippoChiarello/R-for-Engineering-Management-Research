CONTROL DEVICE FOR AUTOMATIC TRACKING CAMERA
</title>

<abstract>
Based on information on a tracking target, a tracking target detecting unit is configured to detect the tracking target from an image captured by an automatic tracking camera. An influencing factor detecting unit is configured to detect an influencing factor that influences the amount of movement of the tracking target and set an influence degree, based on information on the influencing factor. Based on the influence degree set by the influencing factor detecting unit and a past movement amount of the tracking target, an adjustment amount calculating unit is configured to calculate an imaging direction adjustment amount for the automatic tracking camera.

<claims>
1. A control device for an automatic tracking camera that automatically tracks and images a tracking target, the control device comprising: a tracking target detecting unit that is configured to detect, based on information on the tracking target, the tracking target from an image captured by the automatic tracking camera; an influencing factor detecting unit that is configured to detect an influencing factor that influences a movement amount of the tracking target and set an influence degree, based on information on the influencing factor; and an adjustment amount calculating unit that is configured to calculate an imaging direction adjustment amount for the automatic tracking camera, based on the influence degree set by the influencing factor detecting unit and a past movement amount of the tracking target.
2. The control device for the automatic tracking camera, according to claim 1, wherein if the influencing factor detecting unit detects plural of the influencing factors, the influencing factor detecting unit sets, as a final influence degree, a value calculated based on influence degrees corresponding respectively to the plural of the influencing factors.
3. The control device for the automatic tracking camera, according to claim 1, wherein the information on the influencing factor is image information, and the influencing factor detecting unit detects the influencing factor from the image captured by the automatic tracking camera.
4. The control device for the automatic tracking camera, according to claim 1, wherein the influencing factor is a moving body, and the influence degree of the influencing factor is a value that differs depending on a positional relation between the tracking target and the influencing factor.
5. The control device for the automatic tracking camera, according to claim 1, wherein if the tracking target is displaced from the center of the image captured by the automatic tracking camera by dx in a horizontal direction and dy in a vertical direction, the adjustment amount calculating unit sets a target of adjustment of imaging direction for the automatic tracking camera to a position where the tracking target is displaced in the same directions by a×dx in the horizontal direction and by b×dy in the vertical direction from the center of an image captured by the automatic tracking camera, and a and b are values larger than 0 and smaller than 1.
6. The control device for the automatic tracking camera, according to claim 1, wherein the information on the influencing factor is an imaging direction of the automatic tracking camera.
7. The control device for the automatic tracking camera, according to claim 1, further comprising: an AI analyzing unit that is configured to set an influence degree for a movement amount of the tracking target by using artificial intelligence, based on plural factors that influence the movement amount of the tracking target, wherein the adjustment amount calculating unit calculates the imaging direction adjustment amount for the automatic tracking camera, based on the influence degree set by the AI analyzing unit and the past movement amount of the tracking target.
8. The control device for the automatic tracking camera, according to claim 7, wherein the AI analyzing unit calculates a correct answer for influence degree by analyzing the image captured by the automatic tracking camera by using the influence degree that has been set, and executes deep learning by using the calculated correct answer for influence degree and the plural factors as teacher data.
9. The control device for the automatic tracking camera, according to claim 7, wherein the plural factors include one or more selected from a group including: an influencing factor that has been registered as an image; imaging direction of the automatic tracking camera; an elapsed time period from start of a game; a time; score information; temperature; humidity; and moving velocity of the tracking target.
10. A control method for an automatic tracking camera that automatically tracks and images a tracking target, the control method including: a step of detecting, based on information on the tracking target, the tracking target from an image captured by the automatic tracking camera; a step of detecting an influencing factor that influences a movement amount of the tracking target and sets an influence degree, based on information on the influencing factor; and a step of calculating, based on the influence degree set through the step of setting the influence degree and a past movement amount of the tracking target, an imaging direction adjustment amount for the automatic tracking camera.
