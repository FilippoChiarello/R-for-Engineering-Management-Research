MODIFIED BIOTIN-BINDING PROTEIN, FUSION PROTEINS THEREOF AND APPLICATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosure provides modified biotin-binding proteins which can be expressed in soluble form in high yield in bacteria. Also provided are fusion proteins comprising the modified biotin-binding protein and an antigen. The disclosure further provides non-hemolytic variants of alpha-hemolysin from S. aureus and fusion protein comprising non-hemolytic variant of alpha-hemolysin and a biotin-binding domains. Immunogenic compositions comprising the proteins are also disclosed and use of such immunogenic compositions for inducing an immune response or for vaccinating a subject are also disclosed.

<claims>
1. 1.-14. (canceled)
15. A fusion protein comprising a biotin-binding protein and an antigenic protein or a peptide, wherein the biotin-binding protein comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 90% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:1.
16. 16-34. (canceled)
35. A mutant alpha-hemolysin (mHla) protein, comprising a mutation at amino acid residue 205, 213 or 209-211 of wild-type S. aureus alpha-hemolysin, wherein the mutant alpha-hemolysin has lower hemolytic activity than an equivalent titer of wild-type alpha-hemolysin (Hla).
36. The mutant alpha-hemolysin of claim 35, wherein the hemolytic activity of mutant alpha-hemolysin is at least 25% lower than an equivalent titer of wild-type Hla.
37. The mutant alpha-hemolysin of claim 35, wherein the mutant alpha-hemolysin comprises one of the following mutations in the wild-type S. aureus alphs-hemolysin: (i) residue 205 W to A; (ii) residue 213 W to A; or (iii) residues 209-211 DRD to AAA.
38. The mutant alpha-hemolysin of claim 35, wherein the mutant alpha-hemolysin comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 23, SEQ ID NO: 24, SEQ ID NO: 25, and functional variants, portions, and derivatives thereof.
39. A composition comprising a mutant alpha-hemolysin of claim 35.
40. A fusion protein comprising an alpha-hemolysin and a biotin-binding domain, wherein the fusion protein has lower hemolytic activity than an equivalent titer of wild-type alpha-hemolysin (Hla).
41. The fusion protein of claim 40, wherein the alpha-hemolysin is a mutant alpha-hemolysin protein comprising a mutation at amino acid residue 205, 213 or 209-211 of wild-type S. aureus alpha-hemolysin or the alpha-hemolysin consists of the the amino acids sequence of amino acids 27-319 of wild-type alpha-hemolysin of S. aureus.
42. The fusion protein of claim 40, wherein the biotin-binding domain comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 90% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 1.
43. The fusion protein of claim 40, wherein the biotin-binding domain and the mutant alpha-hemolysin are linked by a peptide linker.
44. The fusion protein of claim 43, wherein the peptide linker comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 22.
45. The fusion protein of claim 40, wherein the fusion protein comprises a bacterial signal sequence at the N-terminus.
46. 46.-48. (canceled)
49. The fusion protein of claim 40, wherein the fusion protein comprises a purification tag at the C-terminus.
50. 50.-54. (canceled)
55. The fusion protein of claim 40, wherein the fusion protein comprises the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 26, SEQ ID NO: 27, and SEQ ID NO: 28.
56. The fusion protein of any claim 40, wherein the hemolytic activity of the fusion protein is at least 25% lower than an equivalent titer of wild-type Hla.
57. A composition comprising a fusion protein of claim 40.
58. A method inducing an immune response in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a composition of claim 39.
59. (canceled)
60. The method of claim 58, wherein the subject is a human.
61. 61.-63. (canceled)
64. The method of claim 58, wherein the immune response is an antibody/B-cell response.
65. The method of claim 58, wherein the immune response is a CD4+ T-cell response, including Th1, Th2, or Th17 response, and/or a CD8+ T-cell response.
66. 66.-67. (canceled)
