DRYER FOR HERBACEOUS MATERIAL HAVING INCLINED VANES
</title>

<abstract>
The dryer comprises a dryer receptacle having an inner space for receiving herbaceous material and a driving device for rotating the dryer receptacle about a rotation axis of the dryer receptacle. Vanes for engaging herbaceous material received in the inner space of the dryer receptacle extend from an inner surface of the dryer receptacle into the inner space of the dryer receptacle. In a cross-section with a sectional plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, the vanes are inclined with respect to the radial direction. Vane heating elements are incorporated into the vanes.

<claims>
1 . Rotary dryer for drying herbaceous material, comprising
a dryer receptacle having an inner space for receiving herbaceous material; and
a driving device for rotating the dryer receptacle about a rotation axis of the dryer receptacle, wherein the rotary dryer comprises vanes for engaging herbaceous material received in the inner space of the dryer receptacle, the vanes extending from an inner surface of the dryer receptacle into the inner space of the dryer receptacle,
wherein in a cross-section with a sectional plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, the vanes are inclined with respect to the radial direction, and
wherein the rotary dryer further comprises vane heating elements incorporated into the vanes.
2. Rotary dryer according to claim 1 , further comprising a tilting device for adjusting a tilting angle of the dryer receptacle with respect to a horizontal plane.
3. Rotary dryer according to claim 1 or 2, wherein in the cross-section with the sectional plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, the vanes have a curvature.
4. Rotary dryer according to claim 3, wherein the curvature of the vanes is a curvature in the direction of the inclination of the vanes.
5. Rotary dryer according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the vanes extend along the inner surface of the dryer receptacle in parallel to the rotation axis.
6. Rotary dryer according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the vanes extend along the inner surface of the dryer receptacle on paths that are superpositions of an extension parallel to the rotation axis and a rotation about the rotation axis.
7. Rotary dryer according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein an arc distance between two adjacent vanes with respect to the rotation axis is equal to or greater than a height dimension of the vanes.
8. Rotary dryer according to any one of the preceding claims, further comprising a liquid dispersion assembly comprising at least one nozzle rotatably provided inside the inner space of the dryer receptacle and configured to spray liquid.
9. Rotary dryer according to any one of the preceding claims, further comprising a conveyor for feeding herbaceous material into the inner space of the dryer receptacle.
10. Method for drying herbaceous material, comprising the steps of - introducing the herbaceous material into an inner space of a dryer receptacle having vanes extending from an inner surface of the dryer receptacle into the inner space of the dryer receptacle;
- rotating the dryer receptacle having the herbaceous material received therein about a rotation axis of the dryer receptacle in a direction of rotation;
- engaging the herbaceous material received in the dryer receptacle with engagement surfaces of the vanes; and
actively heating the vanes,
wherein in a sectional plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, angles between the engagement surfaces of the vanes and the inner surface of the dryer receptacle are larger when measured in the direction of rotation of the dryer receptacle than when measured against the direction of rotation of the dryer receptacle.
1 1 . Method according to claim 10, further comprising temporarily capturing herbaceous material between the engagement surfaces of the vanes and the inner surface of the dryer receptacle during rotation of the dryer receptacle, wherein the herbaceous material is preferably captured between the engagement surfaces of the vanes and the inner surface of the dryer receptacle for at least a quarter of the rotation of the dryer receptacle.
12. Method according to claim 10 or 11 , wherein the vanes are heated with vane heating elements incorporated into the vanes.
13. Method according to any one of claims 10 to 12, further comprising treating volatiles evaporated in the dryer receptacle.
14. Method according to any one of claims 10 to 13, wherein in the sectional plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, the vanes have a curvature.
15. Method according to claim 14, wherein the curvature of the vanes is a curvature in the direction of the inclination of the vanes.
16. Use of actively heated asymmetrical structures on an inner surface of a rotating dryer receptacle receiving herbaceous material for influencing the distribution of the herbaceous material during rotation of the dryer receptacle.
