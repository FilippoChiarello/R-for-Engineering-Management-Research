<title>
Low probability transitions and boundary crossing into disallowed states for a more optimal solution
</title>

<abstract>
Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that map disallowed states and enable access to those states under certain conditions through a search algorithm are disclosed. In other words, scenario boundaries may be crossed by jumping from one scenario that is less desirable or even has no solution to another scenario that is more desirable.

<claims>
1. A computer program embodied on a non-transitory computer-readable medium, the program configured to cause at least one processor to: map trade space versus time for a plurality of scenarios, whether reachable or not within rules of a system, each pathway in the plurality of scenarios comprising a plurality of nodes; while following a pathway from an initial starting point, search for nearby nodes from otherwise unreachable outcomes that provide a better solution; when a node is found that is proximate within the predetermined distance and is associated with a pathway that provides a better solution, jump to the proximate node and follow the path to the better solution; and output the path with the better solution, wherein the mapping of trade space versus time comprises determining unique IDs (UIDs) for each node in the map, and the UIDs comprise numbers derived from a dimensional reduction technique that provides relational meaning between unique IDs.
2. The computer program of claim 1, wherein the program is further configured to cause the at least one processor to: positively weight pathways leading to more desirable outcomes.
3. The computer program of claim 1, wherein the searching for the nearby nodes from otherwise unreachable outcomes that provide a better solution comprises employing a random search for otherwise unreachable nodes that are proximate within a predetermined distance in the trade space to a current node of the pathway, but provide a better solution.
4. The computer program of claim 1, wherein the program is configured to cause the at least one processor to: randomly seed space and time to select the initial possible starting point.
5. The computer program of claim 1, wherein trade space versus time is mapped for all scenarios.
6. The computer program of claim 1, wherein the map is based on image data, and the UIDs each comprise six numbers that are derived from principal component analysis of three principal components of a 2D wavelet transform of a respective image and three principal components of a discrete cosine transform (DCT) of the respective image.
7. The computer program of claim 6, wherein the six numbers are between 1 and 100.
8. The computer program of claim 1, wherein the UIDs comprise numbers representing sentiment.
9. The computer program of claim 1, wherein two numbers of the UIDs are used to facilitate pattern lock, and the pattern lock is utilized for cases where states are identical to enable repeating states to occur and still retain a sequence.
10. The computer program of claim 9, wherein upon choosing a next possible step, the program is further configured to cause the at least one processor to: evaluate prior experiences from the pattern lock; choose a best experienced outcome; search adjacent Urns that have been previously experienced or simulated; and evaluate whether a potential improvement of outcome warrants choosing a new path that has not been experienced.
11. The computer program of claim 1, wherein two numbers between 1 and 99 are used to represent sentiment, with multiplier between 0 and 100 on a second one of the two sentiment numbers such that values between 1 and 9999 are possible.
12. The computer program of claim 1, wherein the UIDs comprise six spatial numbers denoted A, B, C, D, E, F representing the trade space and two numbers denoted G, H representing sentiment, and a difference between a current node X and a next node Y is given by:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?((AX+BX+CX+DX+EX+FX)+(GX×HX))−((AY+BY+CY+DY+EY+FY)+(GY×HY)).description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?
13. The computer program of claim 12, wherein the sentiment numbers G, H are multiplied by a factor that enables a balance between the six spatial numbers A, B, C, D, E, F describing trade space proximity and the two sentiment numbers G, H.
14. The computer program of claim 1, wherein the program is configured to cause the at least one processor to jump to a most desirable path of a plurality of paths with success outcomes, or jump from a success path to a more desirable success path, when a node of the more desirable or most desirable success path is proximate within the predetermined distance to the current node.
15. The computer program of claim 1, wherein the pathways comprise positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.
16. The computer program of claim 15, wherein the pathways with neutral sentiments become more positive or more negative as time advances.
17. The computer program of claim 1, wherein the program determines paths with better solutions for self-driving cars, image recognition, trade negotiations, music, or any combination thereof.
