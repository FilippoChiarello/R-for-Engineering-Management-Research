<title>
Containerized desalination system
</title>

<abstract>
A water desalination system includes a first set of ultrafiltration membranes, a second set of ultrafiltration membranes, a first backwashing system configured to treat at least one of the first set of ultrafiltration membranes or the second set of ultrafiltration membranes with brine generated by a reverse osmosis process, and a second backwashing system configured to treat at least one of the first set of ultrafiltration membranes or the second set of ultrafiltration membranes with one or more chemicals and reverse osmosis permeate water.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A water desalination system comprising: a first set of ultrafiltration membranes; a second set of ultrafiltration membranes; a first backwashing system configured to treat at least one of the first set of ultrafiltration membranes or the second set of ultrafiltration membranes with brine generated by a reverse osmosis process; and a second backwashing system configured to treat at least one of the first set of ultrafiltration membranes or the second set of ultrafiltration membranes with one or more chemicals and reverse osmosis permeate water originating from the reverse osmosis process.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising one or more filters through which water passes prior to being provided to at least one of the first set of ultrafiltration membranes or the second set of ultrafiltration membranes.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the one or more filters comprise one or more disc filters.
4. The system of claim 2, wherein the one or more filters are cleaned during an automated cleaning cycle.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein, during the automated cleaning cycle, the one or more filters are decompressed, rinsed, and recompressed.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the first set of ultrafiltration membranes and the second set of ultrafiltration membranes are configured to filter water that is provided to one or more reverse osmosis membranes that perform the reverse osmosis process.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the first backwashing system receives the brine via a direct feed from the one or more reverse osmosis membranes.
8. The system of claim 1, further comprising a control system that configures operation of at least one of the first backwashing system or the second backwashing system.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the first backwashing system is configured to treat the first set of ultrafiltration membranes with the brine generated by the reverse osmosis process while the second set of ultrafiltration membranes filters water.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the second backwashing system is configured to treat the first set of ultrafiltration membranes with the one or more chemicals and the reverse osmosis permeate water while the second set of ultrafiltration membranes filters water.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the second backwashing system comprises a dosing system.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the dosing system comprises at least one of: a tank containing the one or more chemicals, a pump, and a valve.
13. The system of claim 1, further comprising a clean in place (CIP) system.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the CIP system is configured to perform a rinsing operation upon determining that a reverse osmosis process has stopped for a defined period of time.
15. The water desalination system of claim 1, further comprising a computing device configured to execute a smart operations application.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the computing device configures at least one of the first backwashing system or the second backwashing system based on data received from one or more sensors of the water desalination system.
17. The system of claim 15, wherein the computing device configures at least one of the first backwashing system or the second backwashing system based on data received from a second water desalination system.
