Method and System for Determining Risk Score for a Contract Document
</title>

<abstract>
A method for determining a risk score for a contract document, is provided. The method includes extracting, by a processor, at least one clause from the contract document and determining, by the processor, a clause category risk score associated with a clause category of the extracted at least one clause. The clause category risk score is determined based on a clause risk score of the extracted at least one clause and a clause risk probability associated with the clause risk score of the extracted at least one clause. The method further includes determining, by the processor, the risk score for the contract document based on the clause category risk score associated with the clause category of the extracted at least one clause.
</abstract>

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for determining a risk score for a contract document, the method comprising: extracting, by a processor, at least one clause from the contract document; determining, by the processor, a clause category risk score associated with a clause category of the extracted at least one clause, wherein the clause category risk score is determined based on a clause risk score of the extracted at least one clause and a clause risk probability associated with the clause risk score of the extracted at least one clause; and determining, by the processor, the risk score for the contract document based on the clause category risk score associated with the clause category of the extracted at least one clause.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising: determining, by a machine learning engine, a clause category and a clause category probability associated with the clause category of the extracted at least one clause, wherein the clause category is determined based on a machine learning based statistical classification of a text of the extracted at least one clause.
3. The method as claimed in claim 2, further comprising: extracting, by the machine learning engine, metadata associated with the extracted at least one clause based on the clause category of the extracted at least one clause.
4. The method as claimed in claim 3, further comprising: determining, by the machine learning engine, the clause risk score of the at least one clause and the clause risk probability associated with the clause risk score of the extracted at least one clause.
5. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein determining, by the processor, the risk score for the contract document further comprises determining the risk score based on weightage of the clause category of the extracted at least one clause.
6. A control system for determining a risk score for a contract document, the control system comprising: an input unit configured to receive the contract document; a processor communicably coupled to the input unit, the processor configured to: extract at least one clause from the contract document; determine a clause category risk score associated with a clause category of the extracted at least one clause, wherein the clause category risk score is determined based on a clause risk score of the extracted at least one clause and a clause risk probability associated with the clause risk score of the extracted at least one clause; and determine the risk score for the contract document based on the clause category risk score associated with the clause category of the extracted at least one clause.
7. The control system as claimed in claim 6, further includes: a machine learning engine configured to determine a clause category and a clause category probability associated with the clause category of the extracted at least one clause, wherein the clause category is determined based on a machine learning based statistical classification of a text of the extracted at least one clause.
8. The control system as claimed in claim 7, wherein the machine learning engine is configured to: extract metadata associated with the extracted at least one clause based on the clause category of the extracted at least one clause.
9. The control system as claimed in claim 8, wherein the machine learning engine is configured to: determine the clause risk score of the extracted at least one clause and the clause risk probability associated with the clause risk score of the extracted at least one clause.
10. The control system as claimed in claim 6, wherein the processor is configured to determine the risk score for the contract document based on weightage of the clause category of the extracted at least one clause.
