Field traveling route production system and field work vehicle
</title>

<abstract>
A field traveling route production system includes: a field information storage section that stores field information including position information each of a field and an entrance/exit area of the field; a work traveling route calculation section (61) that calculates a work traveling route for the field work vehicle based on the field information and specification of the field work vehicle, the work traveling route interconnecting a traveling work starting point and a traveling work ending point; a fore traveling route calculation section (62) that calculates a fore traveling route extending from the entrance/exit area to the traveling work starting point of the work traveling route; and a post traveling route calculation section (63) that calculates a post traveling route extending from the traveling work ending point to the entrance/exit area.

<claims>
1. A field traveling route production system configured to produce a traveling route for a field work vehicle, the system comprising: a field information storage section that stores field information including position information of a field and position information of an entrance/exit area of the field including an area outside the field; a work traveling route calculation section that calculates a work traveling route for the field work vehicle based on the field information and specification of the field work vehicle, the work traveling route interconnecting a traveling work starting point located inside the field and a traveling work ending point located inside the field; a fore traveling route calculation section that calculates a fore traveling route extending from the area outside the field to the traveling work starting point of the work traveling route through the entrance/exit area; and a post traveling route calculation section that calculates a post traveling route extending from the traveling work ending point to the area outside the field through the entrance/exit area.
2. A field work vehicle incorporating the field traveling route production system as defined in claim 1.
3. The field traveling route production system as defined in claim 1, wherein: the field information includes traveling surface slope information of the entrance/exit area; and the traveling surface slope information is utilized when the fore traveling route and the post traveling route are calculated.
4. The field traveling route production system as defined in claim 3, further comprising: an informing section having a display data generation function for displaying the work traveling route, the fore traveling route and the post traveling route on a display.
5. A field work vehicle configured to perform a traveling work along a traveling route that is generated by the field traveling route production system as defined in claim 3, wherein: the field work vehicle comprises a display for displaying the work traveling route, the fore traveling route and the post traveling route.
6. A field work vehicle incorporating the field traveling route production system as defined in claim 3.
7. The field traveling route production system as defined in claim 3, wherein: based on the traveling surface slope information and the specification of the field work vehicle, a posture and/or an orientation of the field work vehicle are/is determined for the fore traveling route and the post traveling route.
8. The field traveling route production system as defined in claim 7, further comprising: an informing section having a display data generation function for displaying the work traveling route, the fore traveling route and the post traveling route on a display.
9. A field work vehicle configured to perform a traveling work along a traveling route that is generated by the field traveling route production system as defined in claim 7, wherein: the field work vehicle comprises a display for displaying the work traveling route, the fore traveling route and the post traveling route.
10. A field work vehicle incorporating the field traveling route production system as defined in claim 7.
11. The field traveling route production system as defined in claim 1, further comprising: an informing section having a display data generation function for displaying the work traveling route, the fore traveling route and the post traveling route on a display.
12. A field work vehicle incorporating the field traveling route production system as defined in claim 11.
13. A field work vehicle configured to perform a traveling work along a traveling route that is generated by the field traveling route production system as defined in claim 1, wherein: the field work vehicle comprises a display for displaying the work traveling route, the fore traveling route and the post traveling route.
14. The field work vehicle as defined in claim 13, wherein: the field work vehicle comprises an autonomous traveling control section configured for autonomous traveling on the work traveling route, the fore traveling route and the post traveling route.
