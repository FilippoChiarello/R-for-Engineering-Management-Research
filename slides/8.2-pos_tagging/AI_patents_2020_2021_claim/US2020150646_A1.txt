SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR REMOTELY ACTIVATING A VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods described herein relate to remotely activating a vehicle. One embodiment receives transaction information regarding an electronic payment; associates the transaction information with a vehicle; determines that the vehicle is within a predetermined distance from a business where the electronic payment was transacted; and transmits, to the vehicle, a remote activation command that activates one or more subsystems of the vehicle.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system for remotely activating a vehicle, the system comprising: one or more processors; a memory communicably coupled to the one or more processors and storing: a payment-information module including instructions that when executed by the one or more processors cause the one or more processors to: receive transaction information regarding an electronic payment; and associate the transaction information with a vehicle; and a remote-activation module including instructions that when executed by the one or more processors cause the one or more processors to: determine that the vehicle is within a predetermined distance from a business where the electronic payment was transacted; and transmit, to the vehicle, a remote-activation command that activates one or more subsystems of the vehicle.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more subsystems of the vehicle include an engine of the vehicle.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more subsystems of the vehicle include a heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) subsystem of the vehicle.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the remote-activation module includes instructions that cause transmission of the remote-activation command to be conditioned on one or more user preferences.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the one or more user preferences include at least one of user location, vehicle location, weather, an identity of the business, time of day, and a user's calendar of scheduled activities.
6. The system of claim 4, wherein the remote-activation module includes instructions to infer, at least in part, the one or more user preferences based on analysis of the user's past choices.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the remote-activation module includes further instructions to transmit, to a mobile device associated with a user, a notification that the remote-activation command has been transmitted to the vehicle.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the remote-activation module includes further instructions to transmit, to the vehicle, a remote-valet command that causes the vehicle to drive autonomously to a user pickup location.
9. A method of remotely activating a vehicle, the method comprising: receiving transaction information regarding an electronic payment; associating the transaction information with a vehicle; determining that the vehicle is within a predetermined distance from a business where the electronic payment was transacted; and transmitting, to the vehicle, a remote-activation command that activates one or more subsystems of the vehicle.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the one or more subsystems of the vehicle include an engine of the vehicle.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the one or more subsystems of the vehicle include a heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) subsystem of the vehicle.
12. The method of claim 9, wherein transmitting, to the vehicle, the remote-activation command is conditioned on one or more user preferences.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the one or more user preferences include at least one of user location, vehicle location, weather, an identity of the business, time of day, and a user's calendar of scheduled activities.
14. The method of claim 12, wherein the one or more user preferences are inferred, at least in part, based on analysis of the user's past choices.
15. The method of claim 9, further comprising transmitting, to a mobile device associated with a user, a notification that the remote-activation command has been transmitted to the vehicle.
16. The method of claim 9, further comprising transmitting, to the vehicle, a remote-valet command that causes the vehicle to drive autonomously to a user pickup location.
17. A system for remotely activating a vehicle, the system comprising: one or more processors; a memory communicably coupled to the one or more processors and storing: a remote-command module including instructions that when executed by the one or more processors cause the one or more processors to: receive, at the vehicle, a remote-activation command prompted by an electronic payment transacted by a person associated with the vehicle; and in response to the remote-activation command, activate at least one of an engine and a heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) subsystem of the vehicle.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the remote-command module includes further instructions to: receive, at the vehicle, a remote-valet command; and in response to the remote-valet command, instruct an autonomous driving module of the vehicle to drive the vehicle autonomously to a user pickup location.
19. A method of remotely activating a vehicle, the method comprising: receiving, at the vehicle, a remote-activation command prompted by an electronic payment transacted by a person associated with the vehicle; and in response to the remote-activation command, activating at least one of an engine and a heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) subsystem of the vehicle.
20. The method of claim 19, further comprising: receiving, at the vehicle, a remote-valet command; and in response to the remote-valet command, instructing an autonomous driving module of the vehicle to drive the vehicle autonomously to a user pickup location.
