</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a computer-implemented self-supervised learning method for digital pathology. The method comprises: Receiving (102) a plurality of digital images each depicting a tissue sample; Splitting (104) each of the received images into a plurality of tiles; automatically generating (106) tile pairs (312, 313, 314, 315, 422), each tile pair having assigned a label (403) being indicative of the degree of similarity of two tissue patterns depicted in the two tiles of the pair, wherein the degree of similarity is computed as a function of the spatial proximity (d1, d2, d3, d4) of the two tiles in the pair, wherein the distance positively correlates with dis- similarity; and training a machine learning module - MLM - (400, 402, 403, 600) using the labeled tile pairs as training data to generate a trained MLM, the trained MLM being adapted for performing an image analysis of digital histopathology im- ages.
