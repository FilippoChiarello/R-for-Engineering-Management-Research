<title>
Integrated and Automated Video/Structural Health Monitoring System
</title>

<abstract>
Structural health monitoring (SHM)/nondestructive evaluation (NDE) exists as a tool in conjunction with manufactured pieces. Presently disclosed subject matter integrates automated video with a structural health monitoring system. In conjunction with bridge monitoring, integration of such two systems automates determination of the effect or correlation of vehicular loading on SHM data from a subject bridge. Such correlations help to understand the sources of structural health monitoring data, particularly acoustic emission data, in bridges and other structures, such as dams and nuclear plants. Automation of the evaluation of bridges and other structures increases accuracy and minimizes risk to workers and the public. Assessing the structural condition of bridges and other structures as presently disclosed also facilitates automated asset management of transportation systems, such as by state departments of transportation and other bridge/structural owners.
