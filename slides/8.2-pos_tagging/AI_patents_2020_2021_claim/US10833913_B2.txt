Suppression of commerce notifications based on user activity
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed embodiments provide techniques for suppression of commerce notifications based on user activity. In embodiments, the user activity is an activity such as an acknowledgement via an application on an electronic mobile computing device that is associated with the user. A first message is sent including information regarding offers and/or sales at a venue. The user may, at that time, interact with the information by pressing a button or activating a link to obtain more information. That interaction is recorded and used as criteria for sending or suppressing a second message. Alternatively, the second message may be modified. The modification can include rewording the first message as a reminder, and/or removal of audio and/or vibration alerts for the second message. These features promote a user experience in which the user is aware of a sale or promotion and the in-store experience remains positive.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for sending notifications to an electronic device comprising: sending a first message at a first time to the electronic device; responsive to the electronic device receiving the first message, starting a timer; detecting a location of the electronic device; responsive to detecting that the location where the electronic device is presently located is a venue associated with the first message and that the timer has expired, sending a second message to the electronic device; and responsive to detecting that the location that the electronic device is presently located is the venue associated with the first message and that the timer is active, suppressing the second message to the electronic device, such that the second message that is sent to the electronic device is a suppressed second message.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein sending the second message comprises sending message content identical to the first message.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the second message that is sent to the electronic device is suppressed by sending message content modified based on the first message, such that a content of the second message has a passive tone.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the first message includes a sale notice and wherein the second message includes a sale reminder.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein starting the timer includes starting the timer having an expiry duration ranging from three to five days.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising suppressing an audio alert on the second message that is sent to the electronic device.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising suppressing a vibration alert on the second message that is sent to the electronic device.
8. An electronic communication device comprising: a processor; a memory coupled to the processor, the memory containing instructions, that when executed by the processor, perform the steps of: sending a first message at a first time to a mobile electronic device; responsive to sending the first message, starting a timer; detecting a location of the mobile electronic device; responsive to detecting that the location where the electronic device is presently located is a venue associated with the first message and that the timer has expired, sending a second message to the mobile electronic device; and responsive to detecting that the location that the electronic device is presently located is the venue associated with the first message and that the timer is active, suppressing the second message to the mobile electronic device, such that the second message that is sent to the electronic device is a suppressed second message.
9. The electronic communication device of claim 8, wherein the memory further comprises instructions, that when executed by the processor, perform the step of sending the second message that comprises message content identical to the first message.
10. The electronic communication device of claim 8, wherein the memory further comprises instructions, that when executed by the processor, perform the step of sending the second message that comprises message content modified based on the first message, such that a content of the second message has a passive tone.
11. The electronic communication device of claim 10, wherein the memory further comprises instructions, that when executed by the processor, perform the steps of: sending the first message that includes a sale notice; and sending the second message that includes a sale reminder.
12. The electronic communication device of claim 8, wherein the memory further comprises instructions, that when executed by the processor, perform the step of starting the timer with an expiry duration ranging from three to five days.
13. The electronic communication device of claim 8, wherein the memory further comprises instructions, that when executed by the processor, perform the step of suppressing an audio alert on the second message that is sent to the electronic device.
14. The electronic communication device of claim 8, wherein the memory further comprises instructions, that when executed by the processor, perform the step of suppressing a vibration alert on the second message that is sent to the electronic device.
15. A computer program product for sending notifications, for an electronic computing device comprising a computer readable storage device having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by a processor to cause the electronic computing device to: send a first message at a first time, wherein the first message solicits a user response; responsive to receiving the user response, start a timer; detect a location of a mobile electronic device; responsive to detecting that the location where the electronic device is presently located is a venue associated with the first message and that to the timer has expired, send a second message to the mobile electronic device; and responsive to detecting that the location that the electronic device is presently located is the venue associated with the first message and that the timer is active, suppressing the second message to the mobile electronic device, such that the second message that is sent to the electronic device is a suppressed second message.
16. The computer program product of claim 15, further comprising program instructions executable by the processor to cause the electronic computing device to send the second message comprising message content modified based on the first message, such that a content of the second message has a passive tone.
17. The computer program product of claim 15, further comprising program instructions executable by the processor to cause the electronic computing device to suppress an audio alert on the second message that is sent to the electronic device.
18. The computer program product of claim 15, further comprising program instructions executable by the processor to cause the electronic computing device to suppress a vibration alert on the second message that is sent to the electronic device.
