<title>
ADAPTIVE ROUTING PIPELINES FOR VARIABLE ENDPOINT PERFORMANCE
</title>

<abstract>
A system includes determination of a respective performance level associated with each of a plurality of endpoints assigned to a first routing pipeline, determination of a slow one of the plurality of endpoints based on the respective performance levels, and, in response to the determination of the slow one of the plurality of endpoints, instantiation of a second routing pipeline and assignment of the slow one of the plurality of endpoints to the second routing, wherein the first routing pipeline is to receive messages and to route a first plurality of the messages to the plurality of endpoints other than the slow one of the plurality of endpoints, and wherein the second routing pipeline is to receive the messages and to route a second plurality of the messages to the slow one of the plurality of endpoints.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented system comprising:
a routing service comprising:
the first routing pipeline to receive messages and to route a first plurality of the messages to the first plurality of endpoints; and
the second routing pipeline to receive the messages and to route a second plurality of the messages to the second plurality of endpoints,
wherein the second plurality of endpoints are associated with lower performance than the first plurality of endpoints.
2. A system according to Claim 1, the routing service further comprising:
a third routing pipeline, the routing service to:
determine an improved performance of one of the second plurality of endpoints; and
based on the determination of the improved performance, re-assign the one of the second plurality of endpoints to the third routing pipeline,
wherein the third routing pipeline is to receive the messages and to route a third plurality of the messages to the one of the second plurality of endpoints.
3. A system according to Claim 2, the routing service further to:
determine that a duration of the improved performance of the one of the second plurality of endpoints is greater than a threshold duration;
determine that a difference between a message checkpoint of the third routing pipeline and a message checkpoint of the first routing pipeline is less than a threshold value; and
in response to the determination that the duration is greater than the threshold duration and the determination that the difference is less than a threshold value, re-assign the one of the second plurality of endpoints to the first routing pipeline.
4. A system according to Claim 1, the routing service to:
determine a performance of each of the first plurality of endpoints and the second plurality of endpoints and to assign the second plurality of endpoints to the second routing pipeline based on the determined performances.
5. A system according to Claim 4, wherein the determination is based on a respective time to initiate an asynchronous write request associated with each of the first plurality of endpoints and the second plurality of endpoints.
6. A system according to Claim 1, the routing service to: predict a performance of each of the first plurality of endpoints and the second plurality of endpoints and to assign the second plurality of endpoints to the second routing pipeline based on the predicted performances.
7. A system according to Claim 6, wherein the prediction is based on a respective time to initiate an asynchronous write request associated with each of the first plurality of endpoints and the second plurality of endpoints.
8. A system according to Claim 6, the routing service comprising a trained machine-learning network to predict the performance.
9. A method comprising:
determining a respective performance level associated with each of a plurality of endpoints assigned to a first routing pipeline;
determining a slow one of the plurality of endpoints based on the respective performance levels; and
in response to the determination of the slow one of the plurality of endpoints, instantiating a second routing pipeline and assign the slow one of the plurality of endpoints to the second routing,
wherein the first routing pipeline is to receive messages and to route a first plurality of the messages to the plurality of endpoints other than the slow one of the plurality of endpoints, and
wherein the second routing pipeline is to receive the messages and to route a second plurality of the messages to the slow one of the plurality of endpoints.
10. A method according to Claim 9, further comprising:
determining an improved performance of the slow one of the plurality of endpoints; and
based on the determination of the improved performance, re-assigning the one of the second plurality of endpoints to a third routing pipeline,
wherein the third routing pipeline is to receive the messages and to route a third plurality of the messages to the slow one of the plurality of endpoints.
11. A method according to Claim 10, further comprising:
determining that a duration of the improved performance of the slow one of the plurality of endpoints is greater than a threshold duration;
determining that a difference between a message checkpoint of the third routing pipeline and a message checkpoint of the first routing pipeline is less than a threshold value; and in response to the determination that the duration is greater than the threshold duration and the determination that the difference is less than a threshold value, re assigning the slow one of the plurality of endpoints to the first routing pipeline.
12. A method according to Claim 9, wherein the determination of the respective performance levels is based on a respective time to initiate an asynchronous write request associated with each of the plurality of endpoints.
13. A method according to Claim 9, wherein the determination of the respective performance levels comprises a prediction of the performance levels.
14. A method according to Claim 13, wherein the prediction is based on a respective time to initiate an asynchronous write request associated with each of the plurality of endpoints.
