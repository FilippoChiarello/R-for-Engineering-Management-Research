MULTIPARAMETERIC ESTIMATION OF CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS IN SEISMOCARDIOGRAPHY
</title>

<abstract>
The proposed technology relates to the quantifying of cardiorespiratory fitness. It includes the obtaining (102) of a seismocardiogram (SCG) recorded with an accelerometer (14) configured to measure accelerations and vibrations of the chest wall of a person (18) caused by myocardial movement. Properties of a first signal feature (AC) in the seismocardiogram (SCG) are determined (104), wherein the first signal feature (AC) corresponds to the aortic valve closure (AC) of a heartbeat. A measure indicating cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) is then determined (106) based on the properties of first signal feature (AC).
