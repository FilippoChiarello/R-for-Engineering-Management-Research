FUSED MULTIPLY-ADD OPERATOR FOR MIXED PRECISION FLOATING-POINT NUMBERS WITH CORRECT ROUNDING
</title>

<abstract>
A fused multiply-add hardware operator comprising a multiplier receiving two multiplicands as floating-point numbers encoded in a first precision format; an alignment circuit associated with the multiplier configured to convert the result of the multiplication into a first fixed-point number ; and an adder configured to add the first fixed-point number and an addition operand. The addition operand is a floating-point number encoded in a second precision format , and the operator comprises an alignment circuit associated with the addition operand, configured to convert the addition operand into a second fixed-point number of reduced dynamic range relative to the dynamic range of the addition operand, having a number of bits equal to the number of bits of the first fixed-point number, extended on both sides by at least the size of the mantissa of the addition operand; the adder configured to add the first and second fixed-point numbers without loss.

<claims>
1. A fused multiply-add hardware operator comprising: a multiplier receiving two multiplicands as floating-point numbers encoded in a first precision format; an alignment circuit associated with the multiplier configured to, based on exponents of the multiplicands, convert a result of a multiplication of the multiplicands into a first fixed-point number having a sufficient number of bits to cover a full dynamic range of the multiplication; and an adder configured to add the first fixed-point number and an addition operand; wherein the addition operand is a floating-point number encoded in a second precision format having a higher precision than the first precision format, and wherein: the operator comprises an alignment circuit associated with the addition operand, configured to, based on an exponent of the addition operand, convert the addition operand into a second fixed-point number of reduced dynamic range relative to a dynamic range of the addition operand, having a number of bits equal to a number of bits of the first fixed-point number, extended on both sides by at least a size of a mantissa of the addition operand; and the adder is configured to add the first and second fixed-point numbers without loss and produce an adder result.
2. The operator according to claim 1, comprising a rounding and normalization circuit configured to convert the adder result to a floating-point number in the second precision format, by taking a mantissa from the most significant bits of the adder result, calculating a rounding from remaining bits of the adder result, and determining an exponent of the adder result from a position of a most significant bit in the adder result.
3. The operator according to claim 2, wherein: the second fixed-point number is extended to the right by a number of bits at least equal to a size of the mantissa of the addition operand; and the rounding and normalization circuit uses the bits of the extension of the second fixed-point number to calculate the rounding.
4. The operator according to claim 2, configured to provide as a result the addition operand when the exponent of the addition operand exceeds a capacity of the second fixed-point number.
5. A method of fused multiplication and addition of binary numbers, the method comprising: multiplying mantissas of two floating-point multiplicands encoded in a first precision format and producing a multiplication result; converting the multiplication result into a first fixed-point number having a sufficient number of bits to cover a full dynamic range of the multiplication result; and adding the first fixed-point number and an addition operand; wherein the addition operand is a floating-point number encoded in a second precision format having a higher precision than the first precision format, and wherein the method comprises further steps of: converting the addition operand into a second fixed-point number with reduced dynamic range relative to a dynamic range of the addition operand, having a number of bits equal to a number of bits of the first fixed-point number, extended on either side by at least a size of a mantissa of the addition operand; and adding the first and second fixed-point numbers without loss.
