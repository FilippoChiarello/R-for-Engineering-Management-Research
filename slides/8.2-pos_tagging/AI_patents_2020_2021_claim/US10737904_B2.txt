<title>
Elevator condition monitoring using heterogeneous sources
</title>

<abstract>
A condition monitoring system for performing a transformation of mixed elevator data is provided. The condition monitoring system includes a computer sub-system. The computer sub-system includes a memory storing transformation software and a processor coupled to the memory. The processor executes the transformation software to cause the condition monitoring system to acquire quantitative and qualitative information and transform the quantitative and qualitative information to produce transformed information. The processor executes the transformation software to further cause the condition monitoring system to execute analytics on the transformed information and generate predictions based on the analytics of the transformed information.

<claims>
1. A condition monitoring system for performing a transformation of mixed elevator data, the condition monitoring system comprising: a computer sub-system comprising a memory storing transformation software thereon, and a processor coupled to the memory, the processor configured to execute the transformation software to cause the condition monitoring system to: acquire quantitative and qualitative information; transform the quantitative and qualitative information to produce transformed information; execute analytics on the transformed information; and generate predictions based on the analytics of the transformed information.
2. The condition monitoring system of claim 1, wherein the qualitative information comprises non-numerical data.
3. The condition monitoring system of claim 2, wherein the qualitative information comprises categorical data.
4. The condition monitoring system of claim 3, wherein the transformation of the quantitative information comprises executing a mutual information based feature transformation on the categorical data to produce continuous data.
5. The condition monitoring system of claim 4, wherein the mutual information based feature transformation preserves a probability distribution of the categorical data to provide an equivalence value to the categorical data.
6. The condition monitoring system of claim 1, wherein the quantitative information comprises numerical data.
7. The condition monitoring system of claim 6, wherein the transformation of the quantitative information comprises normalizing the numerical data to produce normalized numerical data.
8. The condition monitoring system of claim 1, wherein the quantitative and qualitative information is derived from an elevator sub-system of the condition monitoring system.
9. The condition monitoring system of claim 1, wherein the quantitative and qualitative information is stored on a database of the condition monitoring system.
10. A processor-implemented method for performing a transformation of mixed elevator data, the processor-implemented method being implemented by transformation software stored on a memory of a computer sub-system, the transformation software being executed by a processor of the computer sub-system, the processor being coupled to the memory, the processor-implemented method comprising: acquiring, by the processor, quantitative and qualitative information; transforming, by the processor, the quantitative and qualitative information to produce transformed information; executing, by the processor, analytics on the transformed information; and generating, by the processor, predictions based on the analytics of the transformed information.
11. The processor-implemented method of claim 10, wherein the qualitative information comprises non-numerical data.
12. The processor-implemented method of claim 11, wherein the qualitative information comprises categorical data.
13. The processor-implemented method of claim 12, wherein the transformation of the quantitative information comprises executing a mutual information based feature transformation on the categorical data to produce continuous data.
14. The processor-implemented method of claim 13, wherein the mutual information based feature transformation preserves a probability distribution of the categorical data to provide an equivalence value to the categorical data.
15. The condition monitoring system of claim 10, wherein the quantitative information comprises numerical data.
16. The processor-implemented method of claim 15, wherein the transformation of the quantitative information comprises normalizing the numerical data to produce normalized numerical data.
17. The processor-implemented method of claim 10, wherein the quantitative and qualitative information is derived from an elevator sub-system of the condition monitoring system.
18. The processor-implemented method of claim 10, wherein the quantitative and qualitative information is stored on a database of the condition monitoring system.
