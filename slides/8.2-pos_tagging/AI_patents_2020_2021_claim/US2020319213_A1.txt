DETECTION OF HORMONES IN HAIR SAMPLES AND OTHER BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides methods and systems for generating a reproductive hormone profile of a subject. A method for generating a reproductive hormone profile of a subject may comprise (a) obtaining a hair sample of the subject; (b) processing the hair sample to generate data indicative of a presence of a reproductive hormone in the hair sample; and (c) processing at least some of the data of (b) using a reproductive hormone classifier to generate the reproductive hormone of the subject. The present disclosure also provides compositions and kits for performing methods described herein or using the systems described herein.

<claims>
1. A method for generating a reproductive hormone profile of a subject, comprising: (a) obtaining a hair sample of said subject; (b) processing said hair sample of said subject to generate a data set comprising data indicative of a presence of an anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) in said hair sample; and (c) using at least said data in (b) to generate said reproductive hormone profile of said subject.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein said subject is a human.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising measuring a presence of another hormone selected from the group consisting of dehydroepiandrosterone, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein said reproductive hormone profile is an assessment of ovarian reserve in said subject.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein said reproductive hormone profile is an assessment of reproductive lifespan of said subject.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein said reproductive hormone profile is an assessment of ovarian dysfunction in said subject.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein said ovarian dysfunction is selected from the group consisting of polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, anovulation, persistent follicles, and granulosa cell cancer.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein said reproductive hormone profile is an assessment of said subject after said subject undergoes gonadotoxic cancer treatment.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein said reproductive hormone profile is an assessment of said subject after said subject undergoes a complete oophorectomy.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein said reproductive hormone profile is an assessment of said subject after said subject undergoes a partial oophorectomy.
11. A system for generating a reproductive hormone profile of a subject, comprising: a database comprising reference values of an anti-mullerian hormone (AMH); a communications interface; and a computer processer operatively coupled to said database and said communications interface, wherein said computer processor is programmed to (i) receive a request to process a hair sample of said subject to generate data indicative of a presence of said AMH in said hair sample; (ii) generate an output, which output comprises said reproductive hormone profile of said subject based on at least said data of (i) to said reference values of said AMH in said database; and (iii) display said output on said communications interface.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein said computer processor is further programmed to measure said presence of another hormone selected from the group consisting of dehydroepiandrosterone, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein said reproductive hormone profile is an assessment of ovarian reserve in said subject.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein said reproductive hormone profile is an assessment of reproductive lifespan of said subject.
15. The system of claim 11, wherein said reproductive hormone profile is an assessment of ovarian dysfunction in said subject.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein said ovarian dysfunction is selected from the group consisting of polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, anovulation, persistent follicles, and granulosa cell cancer.
17. The system of claim 11, wherein said reproductive hormone profile is an assessment of said subject after said subject undergoes gonadotoxic cancer treatment.
18. The system of claim 11, wherein said reproductive hormone profile is an assessment of said subject after said subject undergoes a complete oophorectomy.
19. The system of claim 11, wherein said reproductive hormone profile is an assessment of said subject after said subject undergoes a partial oophorectomy.
20. A method of identifying or quantifying anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) in a hair sample of a subject, said method comprising: a) obtaining said hair sample of said subject; b) processing said hair sample to produce a processed sample; and c) identifying or quantifying said anti-mullerian hormone in said processed sample from b).
