DISPENSABLE UNIT RETRIEVAL MECHANISM
</title>

<abstract>
A system enables management of dispensable units by supporting functions such as retrieval, scheduled distribution, analysis, and notifications. To this end, a dispensable retrieval mechanism may be programmed to carry out blind retrievals of dispensable units using a retrieval strategy with a predetermined sequence of retrieval attempts (e.g., fixed or varying two-dimensional retrieval patterns), which may be open loop or closed loop. Techniques may also include the identification of dispensable units through optical sensors and weight measurement devices that can detect, e.g., a texture, a shape, and a size of dispensable units. Such identification can be used to program retrieval attempts by a retrieval robot and in the formulation of the retrieval pattern. Additionally, networked notification systems for dispensable units can be used for updating rules or schedules related to the dispensable units, or alerting users and remote resources of any potential misuse or hazards of the dispensable units.

<claims>
1. A device comprising: a container; a retrieval arm; a positioner coupled to the retrieval arm and actuatable to move the retrieval arm within the container; a sensor configured to measure a signal indicative of a level of dispensable units in the container; and a controller in communication with the positioner and the sensor, the controller configured to receive, from the sensor, the signal indicative of the level of the dispensable units in the container, and to actuate the positioner to move the retrieval arm within the container according to a sequence of retrieval attempts, each retrieval attempt corresponding to a different two-dimensional pattern within a horizontal plane through the container, and each retrieval attempt carried out at a depth of the container based at least in part on the signal indicative of the level of the dispensable units in the container.
2. The device of claim 1, wherein the signal indicative of the level of the dispensable units is indicative of the weight of the dispensable units in the container.
3. The device of claim 1, wherein the signal indicative of the level of the dispensable unit is indicative of force exerted by the retrieval arm on the container.
4. The device of claim 1, wherein the sensor includes a strain gauge.
5. The device of claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to actuate the positioner to move the retrieval arm, between unsuccessful retrieval attempts, by a retreat margin in a direction away from the level of the dispensable units in the container.
6. The device of claim 5, wherein the retreat margin is based on the signal indicative of the level of the dispensable units in the container.
7. The device of claim 1, wherein the container includes a bottom surface having at least one sloped portion.
8. The device of claim 1, wherein the retrieval arm includes a tube and a nib, the tube defining a hollow core, the nib coupled to the tube, and the nib defining an opening in fluid communication with the hollow core.
9. The device of claim 8, further comprising a vacuum source in fluid communication with the tube, the vacuum source controllable to apply a vacuum force through the hollow core to the nib.
10. A method comprising: measuring a signal indicative of a level of dispensable units in a container; moving a retrieval arm within the container according to a sequence of retrieval attempts of the dispensable units, each retrieval attempt associated with a different two-dimensional pattern within a horizontal plane through the container; and selectively adjusting a depth of each retrieval attempt within the container based at least in part on the signal indicative of the level of dispensable units in the container.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the signal indicative of the level of the dispensable units in the container corresponds to weight of the dispensable units in the container.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein the signal indicative of the level of the dispensable units in the container corresponds to force of the retrieval arm on the container.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein measuring the signal indicative of the level of the dispensable units in the container includes measuring a response of a strain gauge in mechanical communication with the container.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein moving the retrieval arm within the container according to the sequence of retrieval attempts includes moving the retrieval arm by at least a predetermined distance within the horizontal plane.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the predetermined distance is greater than half of a width of the retrieval arm.
16. The method of claim 10, wherein moving the retrieval arm within the container according to the sequence of retrieval attempts includes moving the retrieval arm in a random direction within the horizontal plane.
17. The method of claim 10, wherein moving the retrieval arm within the container according to the sequence of retrieval attempts includes moving the retrieval arm progressively toward or away from a perimeter of the container.
18. The method of claim 10, further comprising moving the retrieval arm, between unsuccessful retrieval attempts, by a retreat margin in a direction away from the level of the dispensable units in the container.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the retreat margin is based on the signal indicative of the level of the dispensable units in the container.
20. The method of claim 10, further comprising applying a vacuum force to an end portion of the retrieval arm moving through the container during the sequence of retrieval attempts.
