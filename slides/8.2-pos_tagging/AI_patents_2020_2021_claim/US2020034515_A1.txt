<title>
DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT INTERFACE
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are systems and methods for a digital rights management (DRM) interface. A DRM request can be received via a scheme-agnostic application program interface (API). A scheme-specific request based on the DRM request can be transmitted via a scheme-specific API. A response to the scheme-specific request can be received via the scheme-specific API. A response to the DRM request can be transmitted via the scheme-agnostic API.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving, via a scheme-agnostic application program interface (API), a first digital rights management (DRM) request associated with a first DRM scheme of a plurality of DRM schemes; transmitting, based on the first DRM request, via a first scheme-specific API corresponding to the first DRM scheme, a first scheme-specific request; receiving, via the first scheme-specific API, a response to the first scheme-specific request; and transmitting, based on the response to the first scheme-specific request, via the scheme-agnostic API, a response to the first DRM request.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving, via the scheme-agnostic API, a second DRM request associated with a second DRM scheme of the plurality of DRM schemes; transmitting, based on the second DRM request, via a second scheme-specific API corresponding to the second DRM scheme, a second scheme-specific request; receiving, via the second scheme-specific API, a response to the second scheme-specific request; transmitting, based on the response to the second scheme-specific request, via the scheme-agnostic API, a response to the second DRM request.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining, based on the first DRM request, the first DRM scheme from the plurality of DRM schemes.
4. The method of claim 3, determining the first DRM scheme comprises determining, based on an identifier in the first DRM request, the first DRM scheme.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the response to the first scheme-specific request comprises one or more of a license decision or a key,
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the first DRM request is associated with a first protocol corresponding to the scheme-agnostic API, and the method further comprises generating the first scheme-specific request according to a second protocol corresponding to the first DRM scheme.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the response to the first-scheme specific request is associated with the second protocol, the method further comprises generating the response to the first DRM request according to the first protocol.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the first DRM request comprises one or more business attributes.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the one or more business attributes are excluded from the first scheme-specific request.
10. A method, comprising: transmitting, via a scheme-agnostic API, a first DRM request associated with a first DRM scheme of a plurality of DRM schemes; receiving, via the scheme-agnostic API, a response to the first DRM request; transmitting, via the scheme-agnostic API, a second DRM request associated with a second DRM scheme of the plurality of DRM schemes and different from the first DRM scheme; and. receiving, via the scheme-agnostic API, a response to the second DRM request.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the response to the first DRM request is based on a response to a request transmitted via a first scheme-specific API associated with the first DRM scheme.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the response to the second DRM request is based on a response to request transmitted via a second scheme-specific API associated with the second DRM scheme.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the request transmitted via the first scheme-specific API is based on the first DRM request transmitted via the scheme-agnostic API.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein the response to the first DRM request or the response to the second DRM request comprises one or more of a license decision or a key.
15. The method of claim 10, wherein the first DIM request comprises an identifier of the first DRM scheme and the second DRM request comprises an identifier of the second DRM scheme.
16. The method of claim 11, wherein the first DRM request and the second DRM request are associated with a same protocol.
17. A method comprising: transmitting, via a first scheme-specific API corresponding to a first DRM scheme, based on a first DRM request received via a scheme-agnostic API, a first scheme-specific request; transmitting, via the scheme-agnostic API, based on a response to the first scheme-specific request, a response to the first DRM request; transmitting, via a second scheme-specific API corresponding to a second DRM scheme different from the first DRM scheme, based on a second DRM request received via the scheme-agnostic API, a second scheme-specific request; and transmitting, via the scheme-agnostic API, based on a response to the second scheme-specific request, a response to the second DRM request.
18. The method of claim 17, further comprising: determining, based on an identifier in the first DRM request, the first DRM scheme; and determining, based on an identifier in the second DRM request, the second DRM scheme.
19. The method of claim 17, wherein the response to the first DRM request or the response to the second DRM request comprises one or more of a license decision or a key.
20. The method of claim 17, wherein the first DRM request or the second DRM request comprises business attributes comprising one or more of: account information, a content identifier, a device identifier, or a session identifier.
