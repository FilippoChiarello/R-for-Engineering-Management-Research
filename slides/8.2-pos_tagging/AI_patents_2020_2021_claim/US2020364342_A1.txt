DETECTING SECURITY THREATS BY MONITORING CHAINS OF CONFIGURATION CHANGES MADE TO BASIC INPUT/OUTPUT SYSTEM (BIOS) OR UNIFIED EXTENSIBLE FIRMWARE INTERFACE (UEFI) ATTRIBUTES
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for detecting IHS attacks by monitoring chains of configuration changes made to Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) attributes are described. In some embodiments, an IHS may include a processor and a memory coupled to the processor, the memory having program instructions stored thereon that, upon execution by the processor, cause the IHS to: monitor a chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes; compare the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes against an Indication of Attack (IoA); and report an alert in response to the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes matching the IoA.

<claims>
1. An Information Handling System (IHS), comprising: a processor; and a memory coupled to the processor, the memory having program instructions stored thereon that, upon execution by the processor, cause the IHS to: monitor a chain of Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)/Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) configuration changes; compare the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes against an Indication of Attack (IoA); and report an alert in response to the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes matching the IoA.
2. The IHS of claim 1, wherein to monitor the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes, the program instruction, upon execution, further cause the IHS to access a non-volatile memory (NVM) where BIOS configuration attributes are stored.
3. The IHS of claim 1, wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes comprises at least a first configuration change having a first timestamp followed by a second configuration change having a second timestamp.
4. The IHS of claim 3, wherein the IoA comprises at least a third configuration change followed by a fourth configuration change, wherein the program instructions, upon execution, cause the IHS to compare: (i) the first configuration change against the third configuration change, and (ii) the second configuration change against the fourth configuration change, and wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes matches the IoA, in part, when: (i) the first configuration change is equal to the third configuration change, and (ii) the second configuration change is equal to the fourth configuration change.
5. The IHS of claim 4, wherein the IoA further comprises a time interval between the third and fourth configuration changes, wherein the program instructions, upon execution, cause the IHS to: compare a time difference between the second timestamp and the first timestamp against the time interval, and wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes matches the IoA, in part, when the time difference is equal to or less than the time interval.
6. The IHS of claim 1, wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes comprises: a disabling of BIOS signing, followed by an enabling of BIOS downgrade, followed by a disabling of BIOS auto-recovery, followed by an enabling of BIOS auto-recovery, followed by a disabling of BIOS downgrade, and followed by an enabling of BIOS signing.
7. The IHS of claim 1, wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes comprises: selecting a legacy boot option from a boot list, followed by a disabling of secure boot, followed by an attempt to perform a legacy boot.
8. The IHS of claim 1, wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes comprises: selecting a Secure Digital (SD) boot option, a Thunderbolt boot option, or a Universal Serial Bus (USB) boot option from a boot list, followed by the adding of a boot device to the boot list.
9. The IHS of claim 1, wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes comprises: disabling boot path security, followed by at least one of: disabling a secure boot, or attempting a legacy boot.
10. The IHS of claim 1, wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes comprises: disabling of a BIOS integrity check, followed by an enabling of BIOS downgrade, followed by a firmware update, followed by a disabling of BIOS auto-recovery.
11. The IHS of claim 1, wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes comprises: bypassing physical presence requirement for a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) clearing operation, followed by an a TPM clearing operation.
12. The IHS of claim 1, wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes comprises: allowing a TPM clearing operation, followed by at least one of: allowing a local TPM activation, or allowing a remote TPM activation operation.
13. The IHS of claim 1, wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes comprises: enabling an auto-on feature, an auto-on wake-on-LAN feature, an USB-wake feature, or a wake-on-Dock feature, followed by at least one of: (i) allowing a BIOS downgrade followed by a firmware update operation, (ii) allowing a remote TPM activation operation, or (iii) allowing a remote wipe of an internal drive.
14. The IHS of claim 1, wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes comprises: enabling an auto-on feature, an auto-on wake-on-LAN feature, an USB-wake feature, or a wake-on-Dock feature, followed by at least one of: (i) allowing a BIOS downgrade followed by a firmware update operation, or (ii) allowing a remote TPM activation operation.
15. The IHS of claim 1, wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes comprises: enabling a microphone or camera, followed by an auto-on microphone or camera setting.
16. The IHS of claim 1, wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes comprises: changing a minimum length of an admin password, followed by a disabling of a strong password feature, followed by an admin password change.
17. The IHS of claim 1, wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes comprises: an admin password change, followed by an enabling of an admin setup lockout feature.
18. The IHS of claim 1, wherein the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes comprises: clearing an intrusion warning, followed by a chassis intrusion reset.
19. A hardware memory device having program instructions stored thereon that, upon execution by a processor of an Information Handling System (IHS), cause the IHS to: monitor a chain of Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)/Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) configuration changes; compare the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes against an Indication of Attack (IoA); and report an alert in response to the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes matching the IoA.
20. A method, comprising: monitoring a chain of Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)/Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) configuration changes; comparing the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes against an Indication of Attack (IoA); and report an alert in response to the chain of BIOS/UEFI configuration changes matching the IoA.
