METHOD, APPARATUS AND COMPUTER PROGRAM FOR SELECTING A SUBSET OF TRAINING TRANSACTIONS FROM A PLURALITY OF TRAINING TRANSACTIONS
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a method, an apparatus and a computer program for selecting a subset of training transactions from a plurality of training transactions for training a machine-learning model to be used for classifying trans-actions as either fraudulent or genuine, and to a method for classifying transactions as either fraudulent or genuine. The method for selecting a subset of training transactions from a plurality of training transactions for training a machine-learning model to be used for classifying trans-actions as either fraudulent or genuine comprises clustering the plurality of training transactions into a plurality of clusters based on a similarity measure. Each training transaction comprises an indication whether the training transaction is fraudulent or genuine. The method comprises selecting a subset of training transactions from the plurality of training trans-actions by selecting a first proportion of the training transactions of a cluster of training transactions for the subset of training transactions if the cluster comprises at least one fraudulent training transaction, and selecting a second proportion of the training transactions of a cluster of training transactions for the subset of training transactions if the cluster is free of fraudulent training transactions. The second proportion is lower than the first proportion. The method comprises providing the selected subset of training transactions for training a machine-learning model.

<claims>
1. Method for selecting a subset of training transactions from a plurality of training transactions for training a machine-learning model to be used for classifying transactions as either fraudulent or genuine, each training transaction comprising an indication whether the training transaction is fraudulent or genuine, the method comprising: Clustering the plurality of training transactions into a plurality of clusters based on a similarity measure; Selecting a subset of training transactions from the plurality of training transactions by: selecting a first proportion of the training transactions of a cluster of training transactions for the subset of training transactions if the cluster comprises at least one fraudulent training transaction, and selecting a second proportion of the training transactions of a cluster of training transactions for the subset of training transactions if the cluster is free of fraudulent training transactions, the second proportion being lower than the first proportion; and Providing the selected subset of training transactions for training a machine-learning model.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein at least 80% of the training transactions of a cluster of training transactions are selected for the subset of training transactions if the cluster comprises at least one fraudulent training transaction.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein all of the training transactions of a cluster of training transactions are selected for the subset of training transactions if the cluster comprises at least one fraudulent training transaction.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein a fixed number of training transactions of a cluster of training transactions are selected for the subset of training transactions if the cluster is free of fraudulent training transactions.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the training transactions that are selected (120) for the subset of training transactions are selected based on a proximity of said training transactions to a centroid of the respective cluster if the cluster is free of fraudulent training transactions.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein the plurality of training transactions are clustered using an unsupervised clustering technique.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein the similarity measure is based on k-means clustering and/or based on hierarchical clustering.
8. The method according to claim 1, wherein a number of clusters generated in the clustering of the plurality of training transactions depends on the plurality of training transactions, the method comprising determining the number of clusters to be used in the clustering of the plurality of training transactions based on the plurality of training transactions.
9. The method according to claim 8, wherein the number of clusters to be used in the clustering of the plurality of training transactions is determined using an iterative process that is performed over a range of numbers of clusters.
10. The method according to claim 8, wherein the number of clusters to be used in the clustering of the plurality of training transactions is determined based on a trade-off between intra-cluster variance and inter-cluster variance of the clustering of the plurality of training transactions.
11. The method according to claim 1, wherein the indication whether a training transaction is fraudulent or genuine is disregarded in the clustering of the plurality of training transactions.
12. The method according to claim 1, wherein the plurality of training transactions are financial transactions.
13. The method according to claim 1, further comprising training the machine-learning model using the subset of training transactions.
14. A method for classifying transactions as either fraudulent or genuine, the method comprising using a machine-learning model that is trained according to the method of claim 13 to classify the transactions as either fraudulent or genuine
15. A computer program having a program code for performing the method according to claim 1, when the computer program is executed on a computer, a processor, or a programmable hardware component.
16. A machine-learning model that is trained according to the method of claim 13.
17. An apparatus comprising circuitry, the circuitry being configured to execute the method according to claim 1.
