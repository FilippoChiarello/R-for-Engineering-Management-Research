DATA LABELING SYSTEM AND METHOD OPERATIVE WITH PATIENT AND CLINICIAN CONTROLLER DEVICES DISPOSED IN A REMOTE CARE ARCHITECTURE
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for facilitating remote care management involving a patient (102, 1404) having an implantable medical device (IMD) (103, 170). Upon establishing a remote care session (159,199) between a patient controller device (150, 1405) and a clinician programmer (180, 1424), input from the patient (102, 1404) or the clinician (138, 1422) may be received including audiovisual (AV) communications, remote therapy programming and responsive to the user input, a dialog interface (2402) is effectuated at one of the patient controller device (150, 1405) and/or the clinician programmer (180, 1424), wherein a user characterization label is received which is indicative of a subjective assessment of the particular functionality of the remote care session (159,199), which may be used in generating user-labeled data (2300) pertaining thereto.
