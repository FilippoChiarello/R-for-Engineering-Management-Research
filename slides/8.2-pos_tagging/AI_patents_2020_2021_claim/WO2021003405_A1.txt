SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SPARSE DISTRIBUTED RENDERING
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are described for rendering a 3D synthetic scene. A display client receives point cloud samples of the scene, where the point cloud samples include a point location, one or more viewing directions, and color information for each of the viewing directions. The point cloud samples may be generated by a server using ray tracing. The display client combines information from the point cloud samples with a locally generated rendering of at least a portion of the scene to generate a combined rendering of the scene, and the client displays the combined rendering. The number of point cloud samples may be adjusted adaptively based on performance metrics at the client.

<claims>
What is Claimed:
1. A method comprising:
receiving from a server a plurality of point cloud samples of a synthetic 3D scene, the point cloud samples including (i) a point location, (ii) at least one viewing direction, and (iii) color information for each of the viewing directions;
based on a viewpoint position, obtaining a first set of color samples from the point cloud samples; based on the viewpoint position, rendering at least a portion of a locally stored copy of the synthetic 3D scene to produce a second set of color samples; and
causing display of the synthetic 3D scene using the first and second sets of color samples.
2. The method of claim 1 , further comprising combining the first set of color samples and the second set of color samples to generate a combined set of color samples;
wherein causing display of the synthetic 3D scene comprises causing display of the combined set of color samples.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising de-noising the combined set of color samples.
4. The method of any of claims 1 -3, further comprising:
signaling to the server a requested sampling density;
wherein the point cloud samples are received with the requested sampling density.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising selecting the requested sampling density based on a processing time for rendering the locally stored copy of the synthetic 3D scene.
6. A method comprising:
generating a plurality of point cloud samples of a synthetic 3D scene, each of the point cloud samples having (i) a point location, (ii) at least one viewing direction, and (iii) color information for each of the viewing directions;
wherein the point cloud samples are generated by a method comprising:
selecting a point cloud location on a surface in the 3D scene; and
for each at least one viewing direction, performing ray tracing in the 3D scene to determine color information for the respective viewing direction; and
sending the point cloud samples to a client.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising receiving a requested sample density from the client, wherein the point cloud samples are generated with the requested sample density.
8. The method of claim 6 or 7, wherein a number of viewing directions for a point cloud sample is based at least in part on a level of diffuseness of reflection at the corresponding surface, with the number of viewing directions being decreased for increasing diffuseness.
9. The method of any one of claims 6-8, further comprising receiving from the client information indicating a viewpoint position, wherein the viewing directions are selected based on the viewpoint position.
10. An apparatus comprising a processor configured to perform at least:
receiving from a server a plurality of point cloud samples of a synthetic 3D scene, the point cloud samples including (i) a point location, (ii) at least one viewing direction, and (iii) color information for each of the viewing directions;
based on a viewpoint position, obtaining a first set of color samples from the point cloud samples; based on the viewpoint position, rendering at least a portion of a locally stored copy of the synthetic 3D scene to produce a second set of color samples; and
causing display of the synthetic 3D scene using the first and second sets of color samples.
1 1. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the processor is further configured to combine the first set of color samples and the second set of color samples to generate a combined set of color samples;
wherein causing display of the synthetic 3D scene comprises causing display of the combined set of color samples.
12. The apparatus of claim 10 or 1 1 , wherein the processor is further configured to perform:
selecting a requested sampling density based on a processing time for rendering the locally stored copy of the synthetic 3D scene; and
signaling to the server the requested sampling density;
wherein the point cloud samples are received with the requested sampling density.
13. An apparatus comprising a processor configured to perform at least:
generating a plurality of point cloud samples of a synthetic 3D scene, each of the point cloud samples having (i) a point location, (ii) at least one viewing direction, and (iii) color information for each of the viewing directions;
wherein the point cloud samples are generated by a method comprising:
selecting a point cloud location on a surface in the 3D scene; and for each at least one viewing direction, performing ray tracing in the 3D scene to determine color information for the respective viewing direction; and
sending the point cloud samples to a client.
14. The apparatus of claim 13, wherein the processor is further configured to receive a requested sample density from the client, wherein the point cloud samples are generated with the requested sample density.
15. The apparatus of claim 13 or 14, wherein a number of viewing directions for a point cloud sample is based at least in part on a level of diffuseness of reflection at the corresponding surface, with the number of viewing directions being decreased for increasing diffuseness.
