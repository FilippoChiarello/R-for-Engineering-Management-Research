METHODS AND APPARATUSES FOR GUIDING COLLECTION OF ULTRASOUND DATA USING MOTION AND/OR ORIENTATION DATA
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the technology described herein relate to guiding collection of ultrasound data collection using motion and/or orientation data. Motion and/or orientation data may be received from an ultrasound imaging device, where the motion and/or orientation data provides an indication of the motion and/or orientation of the ultrasound imaging device. Ultrasound data collected by the ultrasound imaging device may also be received. An instruction for moving the ultrasound imaging device based on the motion and/or orientation data and the ultrasound data may be provided. Ultrasound data and motion and/or orientation data may indicate a velocity of the ultrasound imaging device that exceeds a threshold velocity and an instruction for slowing the velocity of the ultrasound imaging device may be provided.
