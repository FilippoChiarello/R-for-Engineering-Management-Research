<title>
AUTOMATIC DETECTION OF DATA FOR ANNOTATION FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE PERCEPTION
</title>

<abstract>
Various technologies described herein pertain to detecting sensor data to be annotated for autonomous vehicle perception algorithm training. A label identifying a type of an object is assigned to an object at a particular location in an environment based on sensor data generated by a sensor system of an autonomous vehicle for a given time. The label is assigned based on a confidence score assigned to the type of the object by a computer-implemented perception algorithm. The computer-implemented perception algorithm assigns the confidence score to the type of the object based on the sensor data corresponding to the particular location in the environment for the given time. An output of a heuristic is generated based on the label and/or the confidence score, and the output of the heuristic is used to control whether to cause the sensor data for the given time to be annotated.
