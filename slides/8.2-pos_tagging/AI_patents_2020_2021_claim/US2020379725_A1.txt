<title>
ENHANCED AUTOCORRECT FEATURES USING AUDIO INTERFACE
</title>

<abstract>
A system and computer-implemented method are provided for enabling an audio interface enhanced autocorrect feature in a mobile device. The method includes detecting activation of an autocorrect feature of a mobile device in response to a portion of text not appearing in a system dictionary, enabling a microphone in response to activation of the autocorrect feature, receiving audio input from a user responsive to a word replacement by the autocorrect feature, and implementing an enhanced autocorrect action based on the audio input.

<claims>
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising limiting the audio input based on environmental conditions.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising detecting via the microphone ambient noise above a threshold.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising initiating an audio override based on personal historic patterns.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising using machine learning.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising analyzing the audio input to determine the desired word.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the analyzing includes using speech-to-text conversion.
8. The method of claim 6, further comprising generating and maintaining a user dictionary customized to include common terminology used by the user.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the user dictionary supports multiple languages and dialects.
10. A system comprising; a display screen configured to present a graphical user interface; storage structured to store data and processor executable instruction code; and a processor operationally coupled with the display screen and storage, the processor configured to execute the instruction code stored in the storage to operatively: detect activation of an autocorrect feature of a mobile device in response to a portion of incorrectly typed text not appearing in a system dictionary, enable a microphone in response to activation of the autocorrect feature, receive audio input from a user responsive to a word replacement for the incorrectly typed text by the autocorrect feature, and implement an enhanced autocorrect action based on the audio input.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the processor further executes instruction code to limit the audio input based on environmental conditions.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the processor further executes instruction code to detect, via the microphone, ambient noise above a threshold.
13. The system of claim 10, wherein the processor further executes instruction code to initiate an audio override based on personal historic patterns.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the processor further executes instruction code to use machine learning.
15. The system of claim 10, wherein the processor further executes instruction code to analyze the audio input to determine the desired word.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein analyzing audio input includes using speech-to-text conversion.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein the processor further executes instruction code to generate and maintain a user dictionary customized to include common terminology used by the user.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the user dictionary supports multiple languages and dialects.
19. A computer program product including one or more computer readable storage mediums collectively storing program instructions that are executable by a processor or programmable circuitry to cause the processor or programmable circuitry to perform operations comprising: detecting activation of an autocorrect feature of a mobile device in response to a portion of incorrectly typed text not appearing in a system dictionary; enabling a microphone in response to activation of the autocorrect feature; receiving audio input from a user responsive to a word replacement for the incorrectly typed text by the autocorrect feature; analyzing the audio input to determine the desired word; and implementing an enhanced autocorrect action based on the audio input.
20. The computer program product of claim 19, wherein the operations further comprising generating and maintaining a user dictionary customized to include common terminology used by the user.
