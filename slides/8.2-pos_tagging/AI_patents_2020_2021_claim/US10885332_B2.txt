<title>
Data labeling for deep-learning models
</title>

<abstract>
A first and second scoring endpoint with payload logging are deployed. At the second scoring endpoint, native data and a user-generated score for the native data are received, the native data is pre-processed into readable data for the deep-learning model, and the user-generated score and the readable data are output to the first scoring endpoint, which is associated directly with the deep-learning model. A raw payload that includes the native data is output to a payload store. At the first scoring endpoint, the readable data and the user-generated score are processed by the deep-learning model, which outputs a transformed payload and a prediction, respectively, to the payload store. The raw payload is matched with the transformed payload and the prediction to produce a comprehensive data set, which is evaluated to describe a set of transformation parameters. The deep-learning model is retrained to account for the set of transformation parameters.
