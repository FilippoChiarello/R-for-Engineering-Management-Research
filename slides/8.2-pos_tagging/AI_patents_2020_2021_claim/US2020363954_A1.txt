MEMORY INCLUDING SEARCH LOGIC
</title>

<abstract>
A memory includes a memory array comprising a plurality of pages and a page buffer. The page buffer includes first registers, second registers, compare logic, and third registers. The first registers store data read from a page of the memory array. The second registers store a user pattern. The compare logic compares the data stored in the first registers to the user pattern stored in the second registers. The third registers store the comparison results.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A memory comprising: a memory array comprising a plurality of pages; a page buffer comprising: first registers to store data read from a page of the memory array; second registers to store a user pattern; compare logic to compare the data stored in the first registers to the user pattern stored in the second registers; and third registers to store the comparison results.
2. The memory of claim 1, further comprising: search logic configured to identify addresses of the memory array where the comparison results stored in the third registers indicate a match between the data read from the page of the memory array and the user pattern.
3. The memory of claim 2, wherein the search logic comprises an address counter to track the addresses of the data read from the memory array.
4. The memory of claim 2, further comprising: an interface to load the user pattern into the second registers and to output the identified addresses.
5. The memory of claim 2, further comprising: a controller configured to output the identified addresses once each page of the plurality of pages of the memory array has been read.
6. The memory of claim 2, further comprising: a controller configured to output the identified addresses once a single address is identified.
7. The memory of claim 2, further comprising: a controller configured to output the identified addresses once a predefined number of addresses are identified.
8. The memory of claim 1, wherein the compare logic comprises XOR logic.
9. A memory comprising: a plurality of memory arrays, each memory array of the plurality of memory arrays comprising: a page buffer comprising: first registers to store a page of data read from that memory array; second registers to store to a user pattern; compare logic to compare the data stored in the first registers to the user pattern stored in the second registers; and third registers to store the comparison results; and search logic configured to identify addresses of that memory array where the results stored in the third registers indicates a match between the data read from that memory array and the user pattern.
10. The memory of claim 9, wherein each memory array of the plurality of memory arrays further comprises address registers to store the identified addresses.
11. The memory of claim 9, further comprising: a processor coupled to each memory array of the plurality of memory arrays, the processor configured to load the user pattern and initiate a search of each memory array of the plurality of memory arrays in parallel.
12. The memory of claim 9, further comprising: at least one user parameter register to store a size of the user pattern, an accuracy setting for identifying matches, and a number of matches to be identified.
13. The memory of claim 9, wherein the processor is coupled to the plurality of memory arrays through a single channel.
14. The memory of claim 9, wherein the processor is coupled to each memory array of the plurality of memory arrays through a separate channel.
15. A device comprising: first registers; second registers; address registers; and a controller configured to: read a page of data from a memory array; store the page of data in the first registers; store a user pattern in the second registers; compare the data stored in the first registers to the user pattern stored in the second registers; and store addresses of the memory array in the address registers where the comparison indicates a match between the data stored in the first registers and the user pattern stored in the second registers.
16. The device of claim 15, wherein the controller is configured to store the addresses of the memory array in the address registers where the comparison indicates a match concurrently with reading a following page of data from the memory array.
17. The device of claim 15, wherein the controller is configured to receive a match accuracy and store addresses of the memory array in the address registers where the comparison indicates a match within the match accuracy.
18. The device of claim 15, wherein the controller is configured to receive a number of matches and store addresses of the memory array in the address registers until the number of matches is reached.
19. The device of claim 15, wherein the controller is configured to receive a size of the user pattern and store multiple copies of the user pattern in the second registers based on the size of the user pattern.
20. The device of claim 15, wherein the controller is configured to output the addresses stored in the address registers to an interface.
