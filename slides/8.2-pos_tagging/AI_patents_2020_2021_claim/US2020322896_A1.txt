<title>
Interference Mitigation in Ultra-Dense Wireless Networks
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects for interference mitigation in ultra-dense networks are described. Configuration information for at least one co-located hotspot may be determined based on information received from a respective UE of a plurality of UEs and the configuration information may be provided to the at least one co-located hotspot. The configuration information may include an identifier for a channel on which the at least one co-located hotspot is to operate and/or a duration for which the configuration information is to remain valid.
