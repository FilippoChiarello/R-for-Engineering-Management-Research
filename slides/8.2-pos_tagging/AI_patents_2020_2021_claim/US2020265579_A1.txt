<title>
Computer-implemented method for medical image processing
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a computer implemented method (200) for medical image processing. The method comprises providing (202) a database of medical images and providing (204) an initial machine learning model which is trained for segmenting or classifying a medical feature in the medical images. The method also comprises extracting (206) a subset of medical images from the database based on a similarity score of the medical images and training (208) the machine learning model using the extracted subset of medical images in order to provide a refined machine learning model.

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method for medical image processing, comprising: providing a database of medical images; providing an initial machine learning model which is trained for segmenting or classifying a medical feature in the medical images; extracting a subset of medical images from the database based on a similarity score of the medical images; and training the machine learning model using the extracted subset of medical images in order to provide a refined machine learning model.
2. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: acquiring a medical image that is to be processed, wherein the step of extracting the subset of medical images from the database is performed based on a similarity score between the acquired medical image and the extracted medical images.
3. The method according to claim 2, further comprising: identifying a region of interest in the acquired medical image, and determining the similarity score based on the region of interest.
4. The method according to claim 2, further comprising: segmenting or classifying a medical feature in the acquired medical image using the refined machine learning model.
5. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: extracting multiple subsets of medical images from the database based on a similarity score between the medical images of the database; acquiring a medical image; selecting one subset of the multiple extracted subsets of medical images based on a similarity score between the medical images in each of the extracted subsets and the acquired medical image; and segmenting or classifying a medical feature in the acquired medical image using the refined machine learning model which has been trained using the selected subset of medical images.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein the initial machine learning model is trained for feature segmentation or classification using the database of medical images.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein the medical images comprise any of computerized tomography scan images, X-ray images, or magnetic resonance imaging images.
8. The method according to claim 1, wherein the similarity score is determined based on a latent space representation of the medical images in the database.
9. The method according to claim 1, wherein the similarity score is based on content information of the medical images.
10. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: displaying the extracted subset of medical images.
11. A system for medical image processing, comprising: a memory storing a database of medical images; a processor configured to: provide an initial machine learning model which is trained for segmenting or classifying a medical feature in the medical images; extract a subset of medical images from the database based on a similarity score of the medical images; and train the machine learning model using the extracted subset of medical images in order to provide a refined machine learning model.
12. The system according to claim 11, wherein the processor is further configured to acquire a medical image that is to be processed, and to process the medical image using the refined machine learning model in order to provide a processing result of the acquired medical image.
13. A computer program product comprising a computer readable medium, the computer readable medium having computer readable code embodied therein, the computer readable code being configured such that, on execution by a suitable computer or processor, the computer or processor is caused to perform the method as claimed in claim 1.
