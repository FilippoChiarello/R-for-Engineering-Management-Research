Stochastic time-to-digital converter and operating method thereof
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a stochastic time-to-digital converter, which includes a first arbiter cell that compares a timing of a reference signal and a timing of an input signal based on a voltage selected by a first selection signal from among a first voltage or a second voltage and outputs a first comparison result, a second arbiter cell that compares the timing of the reference signal with the timing of the input signal based on a voltage selected by a second selection signal from among the first voltage or the second voltage and outputs a second comparison result, and a binary converter that calculates a phase difference between the reference signal and the input signal based on the first comparison result and the second comparison result.
