SENSITIVE DATA MANAGEMENT
</title>

<abstract>
An approach is provided that detects transmission of sensitive data fields from a user device to an online site. The approach determines the data types of the sensitive data fields and gathers site information from the online site which are stored in a data store along with the current date. Subsequently, the user can manage the data by displaying site information on a display of the user device. Each record of site information pertains to one of many online sites including the selected online site. The user makes a data management request at the user device pertaining to the selected site information. The approach then responsively transmits a request to the selected online site with the request being based on the received data management request. One example of a request is a deletion request that requests that the online site remove the user's sensitive data from the online site.
