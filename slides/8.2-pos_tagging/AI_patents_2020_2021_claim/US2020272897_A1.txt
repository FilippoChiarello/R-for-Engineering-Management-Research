LEARNING DEVICE, LEARNING METHOD, AND RECORDING MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A learning device according to the present invention includes, in semi-supervised learning using domain information: a memory; and a processor. The processor performs operations. The operations includes: including a first neural network outputting data after predetermined conversion by using first data including the domain information and second data not including the domain information, a second neural network outputting a result of predetermined processing by using data after the conversion, and a third neural network outputting a result of domain discrimination by using data after the conversion; calculating a first loss being a loss of the domain discrimination; calculating a second loss being an unsupervised loss; calculating a third loss in the predetermined processing; and modifying a parameter of each of the first neural network to the third neural network in such a way as to decrease the second loss and the third loss and increase the first loss.
