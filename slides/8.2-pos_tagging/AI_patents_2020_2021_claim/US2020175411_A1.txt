SCALABLE NEUTRAL ATOM BASED QUANTUM COMPUTING
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides methods and systems for performing non-classical computations. The methods and systems generally use a plurality of spatially distinct optical trapping sites to trap a plurality of atoms, one or more electromagnetic delivery units to apply electromagnetic energy to one or more atoms of the plurality to induce the atoms to adopt one or more superposition states of a first atomic state and a second atomic state, one or more entanglement units to quantum mechanically entangle at least a subset of the one or more atoms in the one or more superposition states with at least another atom of the plurality, and one or more readout optical units to perform measurements of the superposition states to obtain the non-classical computation.

1. 1.-30. (canceled)
31. A method for performing a non-classical computation, comprising: (a) providing a plurality of trapping sites configured to trap a plurality of atoms, which plurality of atoms is a plurality of qubits; (b) moving one or more of said plurality of atoms from an occupied trapping site of said plurality of trapping sites to an unoccupied trapping site of said plurality of trapping sites, thereby altering a spatial arrangement of said plurality of atoms from an initial spatial arrangement of said plurality of atoms to an altered spatial arrangement of said plurality of atoms; (c) applying electromagnetic energy to one or more atoms of said plurality of atoms to induce said one or more atoms to adopt one or more superposition states of a first atomic state and at least a second atomic state that is different from said first atomic state, wherein at least one atom of said one or more atoms in said one or more superposition states is quantum mechanically entangled with at least another atom of said plurality of atoms; and (d) performing one or more measurements of said one or more superposition states.
32. The method of claim 31, wherein said plurality of trapping sites comprises a plurality of optical trapping sites.
33. The method of claim 32, wherein said plurality of optical trapping sites comprises a plurality of spatially distinct optical trapping sites.
34. The method of claim 31, further comprising quantum mechanically entangling said at least one atom of said one or more atoms in said one or more superposition states with said at least another atom.
35. The method of claim 31, further comprising, prior to (b), obtaining one or more images of said initial spatial arrangement of said plurality of atoms.
36. The method of claim 35, further comprising, prior to (b), performing one or more spatial arrangement artificial intelligence (AI) operations to determine said initial spatial arrangement of said plurality of atoms based on said one or more images.
37. The method of claim 36, wherein said one or more AI operations comprise one or more machine learning (ML) operations or reinforcement learning (RL) operations.
38. The method of claim 36, further comprising, prior to (b), performing one or more spatial re-arrangement AI operations to determine said altered spatial arrangement of said plurality of atoms based on said one or more images.
39. The method of claim 38, wherein said one or more spatial re-arrangement AI operations comprise one or more ML operations or RL operations.
40. The method of claim 38, wherein (b) comprises moving said one or more of said plurality of atoms based on said altered spatial arrangement.
41. The method of claim 31, wherein (b) comprises using one or more electrically tunable lenses, acousto-optic deflectors (AODs), or spatial light modulators (SLMs) to move said one or more of said plurality of atoms.
42. The method of claim 31, wherein moving said one or more of said plurality of atoms increases a filling factor of said plurality of trapping sites.
43. The method of claim 42, wherein said filling factor comprises a value of at least 70%.
44. The method of claim 31, wherein said plurality of qubits comprises at least 10 qubits.
45. A method for performing a non-classical computation, comprising: (a) providing a plurality of optical trapping sites configured to trap a plurality of atoms, which plurality of atoms is a plurality of qubits; (b) using at least two optical modulators to apply electromagnetic energy to one or more atoms of said plurality of atoms, thereby inducing said one or more atoms to adopt one or more superposition states of a first atomic state and at least a second atomic state that is different from said first atomic state; and (c) performing one or more measurements of said one or more superposition states.
46. The method of claim 45, wherein said at least two optical modulators comprise one or more members selected from the group consisting of: spatial light modulators (SLMs), acousto-optic deflectors (AODs), acousto-optic modulators (AOMs), electro-optic deflectors (EODs), electro-optic modulators (EOMs), digital micromirror devices (DMDs), liquid crystal devices, and liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) devices.
47. The method of claim 45, wherein (b) comprises using said at least two optical modulators to selectively apply said electromagnetic energy to said one or more atoms.
48. The method of claim 47, wherein (b) further comprises performing one or more electromagnetic energy AI operations to selectively apply said electromagnetic energy to said one or more atoms.
49. The method of claim 48, wherein said one or more electromagnetic energy AI operations comprise one or more ML operations or RL operations.
