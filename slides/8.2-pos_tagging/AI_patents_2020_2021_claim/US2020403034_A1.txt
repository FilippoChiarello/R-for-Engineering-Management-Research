STACKED RESISTIVE MEMORY WITH INDIVIDUAL SWITCH CONTROL
</title>

<abstract>
A method for fabricating stacked resistive memory with individual switch control is provided. The method includes forming a first random access memory (ReRAM) device. The method further includes forming a second ReRAM device in a stacked nanosheet configuration on the first ReRAM device. The method also includes forming separate gate contacts for the first ReRAM device and the second ReRAM device.
