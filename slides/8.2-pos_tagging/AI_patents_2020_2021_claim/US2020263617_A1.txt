<title>
STATE DETECTION SYSTEM FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE, DATA ANALYSIS DEVICE, AND VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
A state detection system for an internal combustion engine is provided. Rotation waveform variables include information on a difference between cylinders in the rotational speed of a crankshaft during periods in which the respective cylinders generate combustion torque. An obtainment process obtains a value of the rotation waveform variables and a value of a road surface state variable based on an output of a sensor that detects a state of the road surface. A selection process selects, from a plurality of types of mapping data stored in the storage device, the mapping data that is associated with the road surface state variable as the detection mapping. A determination process determines whether the engine is in a predetermined operating state based on an output value of the selected detection mapping that takes the rotation waveform variables as inputs.
