AUTONOMOUS ROBOT SYSTEM FOR STEEP TERRAIN FARMING OPERATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
An autonomous farming system (26) comprising one or more ground-based drones (10) and one or more unmanned aerial vehicles (12), whose routes through a field are optimized by an autonomous farming control system (30) that utilizes linearly constrained integer quadratic programming. The farming system (26) is particularly suited for farming steep terrain that is not accessible to conventional farming equipment.

We claim : 1. A method of autonomously farming a field having steep terrain comprising:
performing a farming operation within the field using at least one ground-based drone, at least a portion of the field upon which the farming operation is performed has a grade of at least 10%;
servicing the at least one drone with at least one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) while the at least one ground-based drone is within the field; communicating at least one of an amount of energy used and an amount of time taken by the at least one drone and the at least one UAV to traverse between at least two sites within the field to an autonomous farming control system, the autonomous farming control system generating a time and/or energy optimized route plan for the at least one drone and the at least one UAV within the field using linearly constrained integer quadratic programming; and
communicating instructions to the at least one drone and the at least one UAV for carrying out the optimized route plans. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the farming operation comprises planting seeds or harvesting grain. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein the servicing of the at least one drone comprises refueling the drone either by replacing a battery pack carried by the at least one drone or providing fuel for an internal combustion engine of the at least one drone. 4. The method of claim 1, wherein the servicing of the at least one drone comprises supplying the at least one drone with seeds.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the servicing of the at least one drone comprises removing harvested grain from the at least one drone. 6. The method of claim 1, wherein at least a portion of the field has a grade of up to 30%. 7. The method of claim 1, wherein the autonomous farming control system is configured to take into account, when generating the optimized route plan of the at least one drone and the at least one UAV, one or more of the topography of the field, soil and/or wind conditions within the field, and at least one physical parameter associated with the at least one drone and the at least one UAV. 8. The method of claim 7, wherein the at least one physical parameter comprises at least one of a drone weight, a drone seed capacity, a UAV weight, a UAV seed capacity, and an amount of seed required per planting site. 9. The method of claim 1, wherein the instructions communicated to the at least one UAV includes coordinates for the UAV to rendezvous with he at least one drone to perform the servicing of the drone. 10. A system for autonomous farming comprising:
at least one ground-based drone;
at least one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) configured to service the at least one drone; and
an autonomous farming control system comprising a processor and wireless communication equipment configured to permit communication between the at least one ground-based drone and/or the at least one unmanned aerial vehicle and/or the autonomous farming control system, the autonomous farming control system being configured to - a) receive information regarding the topography of a field of arable land to be farmed and at least one physical parameter associated with the at least one drone and the at least one UAV,
b) receive information from the at least one drone and the at least one UAV regarding at least one of an amount of energy used and an amount of time taken by the at least one drone and the at least one UAV to traverse between at least two planting sites, c) use linearly constrained integer quadratic programming to generate a time and/or energy optimized route plan for the at least one drone and the at least one UAV within the field, and
d) transmit the optimized route plan to the at least one drone and the at least one UAV using the wireless communication equipment. 11. The system of claim 10, wherein the autonomous farming control system comprises one or more low rank updates modules configured to receive the information from the at least one drone and the at least one UAV and the information regarding the topography of the field of arable land and convert the information into distance matrices DG and DA. 12. The system of claim 11, wherein the autonomous farming control system comprises a linearly constrained integer quadratic programming (LCIQP) module configured to generate the optimized route plan for the at least one drone and the at least one UAV using the distance matrices DG and DA and at least one physical parameter associated with the at least one drone and the at least one UAV. 13. The system of claim 10, wherein the at least one drone is configured to plant seeds within the field or harvest a crop within the field. 14. The system of claim 10, wherein the at least one UAV is configured to deliver seed to the at least one drone and/or replace a battery pack carried by the at least one drone or providing fuel for an internal combustion engine of the at least one drone. 15.
