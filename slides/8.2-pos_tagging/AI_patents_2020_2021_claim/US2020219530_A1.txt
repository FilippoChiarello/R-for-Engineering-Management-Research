<title>
ADAPTIVE SPATIAL VAD AND TIME-FREQUENCY MASK ESTIMATION FOR HIGHLY NON-STATIONARY NOISE SOURCES
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods include a first voice activity detector operable to detect speech in a frame of a multichannel audio input signal and output a speech determination, a constrained minimum variance adaptive filter operable to receive the multichannel audio input signal and the speech determination and minimize a signal variance at the output of the filter, thereby producing an equalized target speech signal, a mask estimator operable to receive the equalized target speech signal and the speech determination and generate a spectral-temporal mask to discriminate a target speech from noise and interference speech, and a second activity voice detector operable to detect voice in a frame of the speech discriminated signal. An audio input sensor array including a plurality of microphones, each microphone generating a channel of the multichannel audio input signal. A sub-band analysis module operable to decompose each of the channels into a plurality of frequency sub-bands.
