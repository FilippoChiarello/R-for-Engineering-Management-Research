ELECTRONIC DEVICE AND CONTROL METHOD THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
An electronic device and a control method thereof are disclosed. The electronic device according to the present disclosure comprises: an input unit; a display; and a processor which controls the display such that, based on a text being inputted through the input unit, a first translation obtained by translating the input text is acquired and the input text and the first translation are displayed, and controls the display such that, based on a predetermined user command being input, at least one related text, related to the input text, and second translations, obtained by translating the at least one related text, is acquired and the input text, the first translation, the at least one related text, and the at least one second translations is displayed.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An electronic device comprising: an inputter; a display; and a processor configured to: acquire a first translation in which an input text is translated based on a text being inputted through the inputter, and control the display to display the input text and the first translation, acquire at least one related text related to the input text and second translations in which at least one related text is translated, based on a predetermined user command being inputted, and control the display to display the input text, the first translation, at least one related text, at least one second translation.
2. The electronic device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to control the display to: display the input text and the first translation on a first user interface (UI), and display at least one related text and at least one second translation on a second UI displayed separately from the first UI.
3. The electronic device as claimed in claim 2, wherein the processor is configured to control the display to add and display a selected text and a translation corresponding to the selected text to the first UI, based on a user command of selecting one of at least one related text displayed on the second UI being inputted.
4. The electronic device as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least one related text is one of an answer text for the input text, a text that is contextually connected to the input text, or a text that supplements the input text.
5. The electronic device as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a memory, wherein the processor is configured to: generate a matching table by matching the input text with a selected text based on one of at least one related text being selected, and store the matching table in the memory.
6. The electronic device as claimed in claim 5, wherein the processor is configured to control the display to align and display at least one text related to the input text based on the input text and the matching table, in response to the text being inputted through the inputter.
7. The electronic device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the predetermined user command is a drag command that touches and drags one of an area on which the input text is displayed or an area on which the first translation is displayed, and the processor is configured to: acquire at least one related text and at least one second translation that is acquired based on the text, based on the drag command being inputted to the area on which the text is displayed, and acquire at least one related text and at least one second translation that is acquired based on the first translation, in response to the drag command being inputted to the area on which the first translation is displayed.
8. The electronic device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the inputter includes a microphone, and the processor is configured to: acquire a text corresponding to an input voice, based on voice recognition being inputted through the microphone, and acquire an alternative text based on the acquired text, in response to the acquired text being an incomplete sentence.
9. A control method of an electronic device, the control method comprising: acquiring a first translation in which an input text is translated based on a text being inputted, and displaying the input text and the first translation; acquiring at least one related text related to the input text and second translations in which at least one related text is translated, based on a predetermined user command being inputted; and displaying the input text, the first translation, at least one related text, and at least one second translation.
10. The control method as claimed in claim 9, wherein in the displaying, the input text and the first translation are displayed on a first user interface (UI), and at least one related text and at least one second translation is displayed on a second UI displayed separately from the first UI.
11. The control method as claimed in claim 10, wherein the displaying further includes adding and displaying a selected text and a translation corresponding to the selected text to the first UI, based on a user command of selecting one of at least one related text displayed on the second UI being inputted.
12. The control method as claimed in claim 9, wherein at least one text is one of an answer text for the input text, a text that is contextually connected to the input text, or a text that supplements the input text.
13. The control method as claimed in claim 9, further comprising generating a matching table by matching the input text with a selected text based on one of at least one related text being selected, and storing the matching table.
14. The control method as claimed in claim 13, wherein the displaying further includes aligning and displaying at least one text related to the input text based on the input text and the matching table, in response to the text being inputted.
15. The control method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the predetermined user command is a drag command that touches and drags one of an area on which the input text is displayed or an area on which the first translation is displayed, and in the acquiring of the second translations, at least one related text and at least one second translation that is acquired based on the text are acquired, in response to the drag command being inputted to the area on which the text is displayed, and at least one related texts and at least one second translation that is acquired based on the first translation are acquired, in response to the drag command being inputted to the area on which the first translation is displayed.
