VEHICLE EXTERNAL INFORMATION OUTPUT METHOD USING AUGMENTED REALITY AND APPARATUS THEREFOR
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle external information output method and an apparatus therefor are disclosed. The vehicle external information output method according to an embodiment of the present invention has the advantageous effect. A DSM camera acquires external information relating to a zone to which a user's gaze is directed. The external information is output to provide the user with a visual field having no blind spot. An autonomous vehicle according to the present invention can be associated with an artificial intelligence module, a drone (unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV), a robot, an augmented reality (AR) device, a virtual reality (VR) device, and a 5G service.

<claims>
1. A vehicle external information output method comprising: sensing a gaze direction of a driver through a driver status monitoring (DSM) camera installed in a vehicle; acquiring an external image of a first zone among a plurality of present zones through a first device installed in the vehicle, when the gaze direction of the driver is directed to the first zone; sensing whether an obstacle is present in the external image of the first zone; and outputting information relating to the obstacle to the first zone through a second device installed in the vehicle, wherein the plurality of preset zones include a plurality of elements configuring the vehicle that block the driver from seeing an outside of the vehicle.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of preset elements configuring the vehicle include at least one of a pillar, a door, a ceiling, and a bonnet of the vehicle.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the second device comprises an external image display installed in at least any one of the plurality of preset zones of the vehicle.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the second device comprises an indicator having a light emitting diode outputting a presence of the obstacle.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: outputting navigation information to the first zone.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the navigation information includes at least any one of a position of the vehicle, a speed of the vehicle, a destination of the vehicle, and an arrival time to the destination of the vehicle.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the information relating to the obstacle includes at least any information among a distance between the obstacle and the vehicle, a moving speed of the obstacle, and a type of the obstacle.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: stop outputting the information relating to the obstacle when the DSM camera detects that the gaze direction of the driver moves from the first zone to a second zone; acquiring an external image of the second zone through the first device; sensing whether the obstacle is present in the external image of the second zone; and outputting, to the second zone, information relating to the obstacle present in the external image of the second zone through the second device, wherein the second zone is one of the plurality of preset zones.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of elements exclude a transparent element in the vehicle, and wherein the second device is any one of a smart glasses, a projector, and an external image display.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the second device is a smart glasses, and the information relating to the obstacle is output in a form of augmented reality (AR).
12. A vehicle external information output apparatus comprising: a driver status monitoring (DSM) camera installed in a vehicle and configured to sense a gaze direction of a driver; and a processor functionally linked with the DSM camera, wherein the processor is configured to: acquire an external image of a first zone among a plurality of present zones through a first device installed in the vehicle, when the gaze direction of the driver is directed to the first zone; sense whether an obstacle is present in the external image of the first zone; and output information relating to the obstacle to the first zone through a second device installed in the vehicle, wherein the plurality of preset zones include a plurality of elements configuring the vehicle that block the driver from seeing an outside of the vehicle.
13. The apparatus of claim 12, wherein the plurality of elements configuring the vehicle include at least one of a pillar, a door, a ceiling, and a bonnet of the vehicle.
14. The apparatus of claim 12, wherein the second device comprises an external image display installed in at least any one of the plurality of preset zones of the vehicle.
15. The apparatus of claim 12, wherein the second device comprises an indicator having a light emitting diode outputting a presence of the obstacle.
16. The apparatus of claim 12, wherein the second device additionally outputs navigation information to the first zone, and wherein the navigation information includes at least any one of a position of the vehicle, a speed of the vehicle, a destination of the vehicle, and an arrival time to the destination of the vehicle.
17. The apparatus of claim 12, wherein the information relating to the obstacle includes at least any information among a distance between the obstacle and the vehicle, a moving speed of the obstacle, and a type of the obstacle.
18. The apparatus of claim 12, wherein the processor is further configured to: stop outputting the information relating to the obstacle when the DSM camera detects that the gaze direction of the driver moves from the first zone to a second zone; acquire an external image of the second zone through the first device; sense whether the obstacle is present in the external image of the second zone; and output, to the second zone, information relating to the obstacle present in the external image of the second zone through the second device, and wherein the second zone is one of the plurality of preset zones.
19. The apparatus of claim 12, wherein the plurality of elements exclude a transparent element in the vehicle, wherein the second device is any one of a smart glasses, a projector, and an external image display, and wherein when the second device is the smart glasses, the information relating to the obstacle is output in a form of augmented reality (AR).
20. An electronic device comprising: one or more processors; a memory; and one or more programs, wherein the one or more programs are stored in the memory, are executed by the one or more processors, and the one or more programs include a command for executing the method of claim 1.
