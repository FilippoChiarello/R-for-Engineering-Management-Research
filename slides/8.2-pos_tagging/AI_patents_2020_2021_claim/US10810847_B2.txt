<abstract>
determining an activity distance, being the distance from a position at the location of the two image sensors to an activity position including the detected motion, positioning in a three-dimensional coordinate system a predefined projection surface at a position having a distance between the position at the location of the image sensors and a position of the projection of the activity onto the projection surface that corresponds to the determined activity distance, projecting the video data from each of the image sensors onto the predefined projection surface that have been positioned at the activity distance, and outputting a two-dimensional video corresponding to the projection onto the projection surface.

<claims>
1. A method for stitching video data from two image sensors arranged to each capture video data of overlapping camera views of a scene, the method comprising: capturing video data of overlapping camera views of the scene using two image sensors, each image sensor having a position in a three-dimensional coordinate system relative to an origin of the three-dimensional coordinate system; detecting motion in an area in the camera views corresponding to the overlapping camera views; determining an activity distance, the activity distance being the distance from a position corresponding to the origin of the three-dimensional coordinate system to an activity position that includes the detected motion; positioning, in the three-dimensional coordinate system, a projection surface having a predetermined shape at a position having a distance from the origin of the three-dimensional coordinate system corresponding to the determined activity distance, wherein the projection surface is positioned so that the projection surface intersects a position in the three-dimensional coordinate system corresponding to the activity position; projecting the video data from each of the image sensors onto the projection surface; and outputting a two-dimensional video corresponding to the projected video data.
2. A method according to claim 1, wherein the detecting motion in an area in the camera views corresponding to the overlapping camera views includes detecting moving pixels in an overlapping portion of the captured video.
3. A method according to claim 1, further comprising determining from pixel data in the overlapping camera views the activity position of the detected motion and using this activity position in the determining of the activity distance.
4. A method according to claim 1, wherein the determining of the activity distance is based on a momentaneous instance of the detected motion in the overlapping image data and setting the position of the motion as the activity position.
5. A method according to claim 1, wherein the determining of an activity distance includes accumulating motion data in the overlapping image data during a predetermined time period and then selecting a position that have accumulated most motion during this time period as the activity position.
6. A method according to claim 1, wherein determining the activity distance includes comparing the position of the activity position in the captured video data with corresponding positions in a predetermined table including distances to positions in a coordinate system of each of the image sensors.
7. A method according to claim 1, wherein determining the activity distance includes receiving a radar signal covering the overlapping scenes, correlating a radar response to the activity position, and retrieving the distance to the activity position from the radar signal.
8. A method according to claim 1, wherein determining the activity distance includes calculating the difference, x1-x2, in position of the activity position in the captured images from the two sensors.
9. A method according to claim 1, wherein the projection surface is a plane.
10. A method according to claim 1, wherein the projection surface is a cylindrical surface.
11. A method according to claim 1, wherein the projection surface is a spherical surface.
