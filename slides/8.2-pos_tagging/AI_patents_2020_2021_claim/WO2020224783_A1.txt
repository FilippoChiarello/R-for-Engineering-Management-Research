SERVICE OPTIMIZATION BASED ON MOBILE MONEY INFORMATION
</title>

<abstract>
A method performed by a network node (e.g., a Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF)) is provided. The method includes registering for receiving notifications from a mobile money application; and receiving the notifications from the mobile money application. The method further includes collecting information from the received notifications, the collected information including revenue information for a first subscriber. The method further includes identifying a second subscriber to make an offer to; and making an offer to the second subscriber, wherein the offer is based at least in part on the collected data and the second subscriber.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method performed by a network node (e.g., a Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF)), the method comprising:
registering for receiving notifications from a mobile money application;
receiving the notifications from the mobile money application;
collecting information from the received notifications, the collected information including revenue information for a first subscriber;
identifying a second subscriber to make an offer to; and
making an offer to the second subscriber, wherein the offer is based at least in part on the collected data and the second subscriber.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the second subscriber is the same as the first subscriber.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the second subscriber is different from the first subscriber.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising determining a relationship between the first subscriber and the second subscriber, and wherein identifying the second subscriber to make an offer to is a result of determining the relationship between the first subscriber and the second subscriber.
5. The method of any one of claims 1-4, wherein the collected information includes coupon verification information.
6. The method of any one of claims 1-5, further comprising retrieving call and subscription information for one or more of the first subscriber and the second subscriber. 7. The method of any one of claims 1-6, wherein the offer is based on one or more of:
(i) a payment record to a third party service function;
(ii) a call record to a third party service function; and
(iii) a payment record of the first subscriber and/or a payment record of the second subscriber.
8. The method of any one of claims 1-7, wherein the collected information is received from one or more of a charging function (CHF) node and a Business Support System (BSS) node.
9. A node adapted for configuring devices for a user, the node comprising:
a data storage system; and
a data processing apparatus comprising a processor, wherein the data processing apparatus is coupled to the data storage system, and the data processing apparatus is configured to:
register for receiving notifications from a mobile money application;
receive the notifications from the mobile money application;
collect information from the received notifications, the collected information including revenue information for a first subscriber;
identify a second subscriber to make an offer to; and
make an offer to the second subscriber, wherein the offer is based at least in part on the collected data and the second subscriber.
10. The node of claim 9, wherein the second subscriber is the same as the first subscriber. 11. The node of claim 9, wherein the second subscriber is different from the first subscriber.
12. The node of claim 11, wherein the data processing apparatus is further configured to determine a relationship between the first subscriber and the second subscriber, and wherein identifying the second subscriber to make an offer to is a result of determining the relationship between the first subscriber and the second subscriber.
13. The node of any one of claims 9-12, wherein the collected information includes coupon verification information.
14. The node of any one of claims 9-13, wherein the data processing apparatus is further configured to retrieve call and subscription information for one or more of the first subscriber and the second subscriber.
15. The node of any one of claims 9-14, wherein the offer is based on one or more of:
(iv) a payment record to a third party service function;
(v) a call record to a third party service function; and
(vi) a payment record of the first subscriber and/or a payment record of the second
subscriber.
16. The node of any one of claims 9-15, wherein the collected information is received from one or more of a charging function (CHF) node and a Business Support System (BSS) node.
17. A node comprising:
a registering unit configured to register for receiving notifications from a mobile money application; a receiving unit configured to receive the notifications from the mobile money application; a collecting unit configured to collect information from the received notifications, the collected information including revenue information for a first subscriber;
an identifying unit configured to identify a second subscriber to make an offer to; and an offer unit configured to make an offer to the second subscriber, wherein the offer is based at least in part on the collected data and the second subscriber.
18. A computer program comprising instructions which when executed by processing circuitry of a node causes the node to perform the method of any one of claims 1-8.
19. A carrier containing the computer program of claim 18, wherein the carrier is one of an electronic signal, an optical signal, a radio signal, and a computer readable storage medium.
