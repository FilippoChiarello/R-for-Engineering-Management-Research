<title>
Systems and methods for intelligently configuring and deploying a machine learning-based dialogue system
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for intelligently configuring a machine learning-based dialogue system includes a conversational deficiency assessment of a target dialog system, wherein implementing the conversational deficiency assessment includes: (i) identifying distinct corpora of mishandled utterances based on an assessment of the distinct corpora of dialogue data; (ii) identifying candidate corpus of mishandled utterances from the distinct corpora of mishandled utterances as suitable candidates for building new dialogue competencies for the target dialogue system if candidate metrics of the candidate corpus of mishandled utterances satisfy a candidate threshold; building the new dialogue competencies for the target dialogue system for each of the candidate corpus of mishandled utterances having candidate metrics that satisfy the candidate threshold; and configuring a dialogue system control structure for the target dialogue system based on the new dialogue competencies, wherein the dialogue system control structure governs an operation of an automated dialogue agent.

2. The method according to claim 1, wherein each of the one or more distinct corpora of mishandled utterances relates to a collection of utterances posed to the target dialogue system that were ineffectively handled by the target dialogue system.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein: each of the one or more distinct corpora of mishandled utterances relate to one or more distinct groupings of historical utterances posed to the dialog system of which the dialogue system failed to provide a successful response to historical utterances of the one or more groupings of historical utterances.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein a subset of mishandled utterances defining each of the one or more distinct corpora of mishandled utterances relates to a grouping of utterances having a dialog intent that is misaligned with an intent applied or computed by the target dialogue system.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the assessment of the one or more distinct corpora of dialogue data of the target dialog system includes: computing a density metric value for each of the one or more distinct corpora of mishandled utterances; evaluating the density metric for each respective one of the one or more distinct corpora of mishandled utterances against a density threshold; if the density metric value for the respective one of the one or more distinct corpora of mishandled utterances satisfies the density threshold, identifying the respective one as the suitable candidate for building a new dialogue competency for the target dialogue system of the subscriber.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the density threshold relates to a minimum density value, if satisfied, indicates that a new competency can be defined or constructed based on mishandled utterance data within the respective one of the one or more distinct corpora of mishandled data.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein the assessment of the one or more distinct corpora of dialogue data of the target dialog system includes: computing a proximity metric value for each of the one or more distinct corpora of mishandled utterances; evaluating the proximity metric for each respective one of the one or more distinct corpora of mishandled utterances against a proximity threshold; if the proximity metric value for the respective one of the one or more distinct corpora of mishandled utterances satisfies or exceeds the proximity threshold, identifying the respective one as the suitable candidate for building a new dialogue competency for the target dialogue system of the subscriber.
8. The method according to claim 7, wherein the proximity threshold relates to a minimum required distance between a target corpora of mishandled utterances and any cluster or corpus of utterance data associated with an existing dialogue competency of the target dialog system of the subscriber.
9. The method according to claim 1, wherein building the one or more new dialogue competencies for the target dialogue system includes: setting one or more machine learning models for each of the one or more new dialogue competencies.
10. The method according to claim 9, further comprising: constructing a corpus of training data for training one or more machine learning models defining a target new dialogue competency of the one or more new dialogue competencies of the target dialogue system, wherein constructing the corpus of training data includes sourcing training data from one or more distinct sources of machine learning training data based on attributes of mishandled utterance data within a target corpus of mishandled utterances of the one or more distinct corpora of mishandled utterances; and training the one or more machine learning models using training samples from the corpus of training data.
11. The method according to claim 9, wherein once the one or more machine learning models are trained, each of the one or more new dialogue competencies of the target dialogue system performs one or more dialogue intent classification tasks using the one or more machine learning models for predicting one or more dialogue intents of a user involved in a conversation with an automated dialogue agent of the target dialogue system of the subscriber.
12. The method according to claim 10, wherein sourcing the training data includes: building a corpus of seed samples based on a sampling of the mishandled utterance data within of the target corpus of mishandled utterances of the one or more distinct corpora of mishandled utterances; and sourcing the training data from a remote crowdsourcing platform based on the corpus of seed samples.
13. The method according to claim 10, wherein sourcing the training data includes: building a corpus of seed samples based on a sampling of the mishandled utterance data within of the target corpus of mishandled utterances of the one or more distinct corpora of mishandled utterances; and probing one or more internal data sources of the subscriber for the training data based using the corpus of seed samples.
14. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: if the training data for training of the one or more machine learning models defining each of the one or more new dialogue competencies satisfy one or more efficacy threshold, deploying each of the one or more new dialog competencies in the target dialogue system.
15. The method according to claim 11, wherein configuring the dialogue system control structure of the target dialogue system of the subscriber includes: setting an archetype that is selected from a plurality of distinct archetypes for each of the one or more new dialogue competencies of the target dialogue system based on attributes of mishandled utterance data within a target corpus of mishandled utterances of the one or more distinct corpora of mishandled utterances.
