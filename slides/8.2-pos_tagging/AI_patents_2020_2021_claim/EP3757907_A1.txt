<title>
HEURISTIC METHODS OF CONVERTING HIGHER ORDER TO QUADRATIC POLYNOMIALS IN BINARY SPACES
</title>

<abstract>
A method of converting a HOBO problem into a QUBO problem. The method may include creating a data structure of key-value pairs by sorting the plurality of indices of the variables of the HOBO problem, the key in each key-value pair corresponding to combinations of quadratic terms appearing in the HOBO and the value corresponding to all terms of at least degree three that contain the associated key. For each key of the data structure, a quadratization process is performed including identifying a key with the largest number of associated values, replacing the identified key with an auxiliary variable, and updating the data structure so as to correspond with the replacement of the auxiliary variable, storing the auxiliary variable and a quadratic term the auxiliary variable replaced as a pair in a data map. The method may also include constructing a quadratic polynomial for each pair in the data map.
