Image analyzing method and electrical device
</title>

<abstract>
An image analyzing method is provided and includes: extracting a first feature vector according to global information of a digital image; dividing the digital image into multiple regions, and inputting each region into a convolutional neural network to obtain a second feature vector; merging the first feature vector with the second feature vectors to obtain a third feature vector; and performing an image analyzing process according to the third feature vector.
