DIGITAL SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A computerized supply chain management system and method includes one or more input/output interfaces, one or more memories or databases, one or more processors communicably coupled to the one or more input/output interfaces and the one or more memories or databases, and an information management platform communicably coupled to the one or more processors. The information management platform includes a process automation component, an application programming interface management component, a dynamic analytics component, and a data management component. The information management platform manages a supply chain using one or more automated processes executed by the one or more processors.

<claims>
1. A computerized supply chain management system comprising:
one or more input/output interfaces;
one or more memories or databases;
one or more processors communicably coupled to the one or more input/output interfaces and the one or more memories or databases;
an information management platform communicably coupled to the one or more processors, wherein the information management platform comprises a process automation component, an application programming interface management component, a dynamic analytics component, and a data management component; and
the information management platform manages a supply chain using one or more automated processes executed by the one or more processors.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising one or more systems, modules, or data sources communicably coupled to the one or more input/output interfaces.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the process automation component automates logistics and inventory management processes using robotic process automation, intelligent data capture and cognitive automation.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the process automation component automatically identifies any purchases and inventory locations of a recalled product, generates instructions to remove the recalled product, and generates a product return for the recalled product, all in response a recall message for the recalled product.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the process automation component automatically identifies any users or patients impacted by the recalled product.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the application programming interface management component creates, analyzes and manages one or more application programming interfaces.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the application programming interface management component automatically creates an item add/change/delete request using a template.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the application programming interface management component automatically processes and provides alternatives backordered items, builds and provides requisitions, and requests and processes services.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the dynamic analytics component provides seamless access to data within the one or more memories or databases.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the dynamic analytics component automatically optimizes procedure-based preference card content.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the data management component integrates, cleans and maintains data within the one or more memories or databases.
12. The system of claim 1, further comprising an innovation sandbox component provides supply chain simulation and application development.
13. The system of claim 1, wherein the information management platform provides one or more functions selected from procure to pay, category management, operations, risk management, business management, and initiative management.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the procure to pay function comprises procurement, payables, informatics and/or customer service.
15. The system of claim 13, wherein the category management function comprises performance consulting, contracting, value analysis and/or formulary.
16. The system of claim 13, wherein the operations function comprises inventory management, logistics, clinical support, operations support and/or CRM.
17. The system of claim 13, wherein the risk management function comprises financial management, business continuity, and/or audit.
18. The system of claim 13, wherein the business management function comprises business development and/or data integrity.
19. The system of claim 13, wherein the initiative management function comprises portfolio management and/or project support.
20. A method for managing a supply chain comprising:
providing one or more input/output interfaces, one or more memories or databases, one or more processors communicably coupled to the one or more input/output interfaces and the one or more memories or databases, and an information management platform communicably coupled to the one or more processors, wherein the information management platform comprises a process automation component, an application programming interface management component, a dynamic analytics component, and a data management component; and
managing the supply chain using one or more automated processes in the information management platform executed by the one or more processors.
21. The method of claim 20, further comprising one or more systems, modules, or data sources communicably coupled to the one or more input/output interfaces.
22. The method of claim 20, further comprising automating logistics and inventory management processes using robotic process automation, intelligent data capture and cognitive automation via the process automation component.
23. The method of claim 20, further comprising automatically identifying any purchases and inventory locations of a recalled product, generating instructions to remove the recalled product, and generating a product return for the recalled product, all in response a recall message for the recalled product via the process automation component.
24. The method of claim 20, further comprising automatically identifying any users or patients impacted by the recalled product via the process automation component.
25. The method of claim 20, further comprising creating, analyzing and managing one or more application programming interfaces via application programming interface management via the application programming interface management component.
26. The method of claim 20, further comprising automatically creating an item add/change/delete request using a template via the application programming interface management component.
27. The method of claim 20, further comprising automatically processing and providing alternatives backordered items, builds and provides requisitions, and requests and processes services via the application programming interface management component.
28. The method of claim 20, further comprising providing seamless access to data within the one or more memories or databases via the dynamic analytics component.
29. The method of claim 20, further comprising automatically optimizing procedurebased preference card content via the dynamic analytics component.
30. The method of claim 20, further comprising integrating, cleaning and maintaining data within the one or more memories or databases via the data management component.
31. The method of claim 20, further comprising an innovation sandbox component provides supply chain simulation and application development.
32. The method of claim 20, further comprising providing one or more functions selected from procure to pay, category management, operations, risk management, business management, and initiative management via the information management platform.
33. The method of claim 32, wherein the procure to pay function comprises procurement, payables, informatics and/or customer service.
