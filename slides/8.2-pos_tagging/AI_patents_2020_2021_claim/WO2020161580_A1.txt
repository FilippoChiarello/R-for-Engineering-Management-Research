SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETECTING ONE OR MORE TARGETS LOCATED WITHIN A MONITORING AREA
</title>

<abstract>
The invention is a system for detecting one or more targets (T) positioned within a monitored area (A), comprising: at least one pair of devices (2), each of which is provided with one or more radio modules (3) having at least one antenna (5) designed to transmit/receive an electromagnetic signal (S); at least one electronic processing unit (4) provided with a first electronic portion (4') associated with one or more radio modules (3) and suited to process the information associated with the electromagnetic signal (S) in such a way as to extract data related to the status of the transmission channel (C), and with a second electronic portion (4') operatively connected to the first portion (4') and suited to process the information associated with the status of the transmission channel (C) in such a way as to obtain data related to the movement and the instantaneous position of the target (T) within the monitored area (A). The electronic processing unit (4) is configured to selectively send a control signal (sc) to at least one radio module (3), wherein said control signal (sc) promotes the variation of the parameters (P) associated with the radio modules (3) to promote the selective emission and/or reception by the same of an electromagnetic signal (S) corresponding to a given wave mode (vx). The invention concerns also a method for detecting one or more targets (T) within a monitored area (A).
