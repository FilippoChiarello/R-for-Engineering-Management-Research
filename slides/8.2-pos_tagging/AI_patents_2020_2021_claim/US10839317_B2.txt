Control device and machine learning device
</title>

<abstract>
A control device includes a machine learning device that learns a state of a spindle during normal machining without a collision of the spindle, and the machine learning device includes a state observation unit that observes spindle estimated load torque data indicating an estimated load torque value for the spindle and spindle acceleration data indicating an acceleration value of the spindle as state variables representing a current state of an environment and a learning unit that learns a correlation between the estimated load torque values for the spindle and the acceleration values of the spindle during the normal machining with use of the state variables.
