<title>
DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF DYSBIOSIS-ASSOCIATED WITH NEC
</title>

<abstract>
This invention provides a method of determining risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in an infant, comprising the steps of: (a) obtaining a fecal sample of the infant's relevant microbiome; (b) sequencing genetic material in the sample to obtain sequence data for the relevant microbiome; (c) analyzing sequence data for the relevant microbiome to identify biomarkers in the infant's microbiome; and (d) categorizing the NEC risk of the infant using the biomarkers identified in the microbiome of the infant.

<claims>
1. A method of determining risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in an infant,
comprising: a) obtaining a fecal sample of the infant's relevant microbiome; b) sequencing genetic material in the sample to obtain sequence data for the
relevant microbiome; c) analyzing sequence data for the relevant microbiome to identify biomarkers in the infant's microbiome; and d) categorizing the NEC risk of the infant using the biomarkers identified in the microbiome of the infant.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein categorizing according to step (d) is based on an artificial intelligence (Al) model developed by analyzing sequence data from the relevant microbiomes of N infants, said N infants comprising at least M infants diagnosed with NEC, and N-M infants not diagnosed with NEC, said Al model developed by processing the sequence data from the relevant microbiomes of the N infants by Machine Learning algorithms to identify at least X biomarkers which differ significantly between infants diagnosed with NEC and infants not diagnosed with NEC and associating said X biomarkers with infants having or at risk for having NEC.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein N is at least 10-fold higher than X and M is at least 2-fold higher than X.
4. The method of any one of claims 2 or 3, wherein X is at least 5, at least 10, at least 20, at least 30 or at least 40 biomarkers.
5. The method of any one of claims 2-4, wherein Nis between 400 and 10,000 infants, and M is between 200 and 1300 infants.
6. The method of any one of claims 2-4, wherein N is at least 30, at least 50, at least 100, at least 250, at least 500, at least 1000, or at least 10,000 infants.
7. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the biomarkers identified in step (c) are proteins, mobile genetic elements, functional annotations, superpathways, and/or taxonomic identifiers.
8. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the biomarkers identified in step (c) are biomarkers found on Table 5 and/or 6.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein at least 3 biomarkers are selected from the top 20 influencers in the NEC model from Table 7.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein at least 5 biomarkers are selected from the top 20 influencers in the NEC model from Table 7.
11. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the infant is a term infant or a preterm infant.
12. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the relevant microbiome is an intestinal microbiome, fecal microbiome, a milk microbiome, a skin microbiome, an environmental microbiome, or a combination thereof.
13. The method of any preceding claim, further wherein the infant's risk for NEC is categorized as high based on the presence of any biomarker enumerated in Table 7. The method of any preceding claim, further wherein the infant's risk of NEC is categorized as high if intestinal arginine levels are at least 1 fold lower compared to known intestinal arginine levels of preterm infants who do not get NEC, Fecal ATP levels, if fecal calprotectin is higher, if lactate dehydrogenase is increased compared to preterm infants who do not get NEC, and/or the
14. The method of ant of the preceding claims Wherein the risk of NEC is at least 5 fold higher for any of the gene abundance of biomarkers identified in Table 5 and 6 compared to the reference control infants.
15. The method of any preceding claim, further wherein the infant's risk for NEC is categorized as high based on the presence of any biomarker enumerated in Table 7.
16. The method of any preceding claim wherein the infant's risk for NEC is categorized as high based on the presence, individually or in any combination, of any of the following biomarkers or homologues thereof: UniRef90_G2SBG8, UniRef90_B5XVF2, UniRef90_Q8SDM3, UniRef90_D7IXQ4, UniRef90_X8H364, UniRef90_B5XPQ3,
UniRef90_G2S602, UniRef90_G8I0W8, UniRef90_WlGNF8, UniRef90_Q64WL9.
17. The method of claim 15 wherein the infant's risk for NEC is categorized as high based on the presence of at least 3 of the biomarkers enumerated therein, or homologues thereof.
18. The method of claim 15 wherein the infant's risk for NEC is categorized as high based on the presence of at least 5 of the biomarkers enumerated therein, or homologues thereof.
19. The method of any preceding clam wherein the infant's risk for NEC is categorized as high based on the presence, individually or in any combination, of any of the following bacterial taxa: Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter asburiae, Bacteroides fragilis, Viellonella sp., Bacteriophage phi-13, and/or Bacteriophage phi-11.
20. The method of any preceding claim wherein an infant having risk of NEC categorized as high is treated by administering B. infantis and/or mammalian milk oligosaccharides (MMO).
