Automated quick task notifications via an audio channel
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the technology described herein provide an efficient user interface that enables users to respond to tasks quickly by providing automated quick task notifications via an audio channel. An audio channel quick task system includes components for recognizing and extracting quick tasks from content (e.g., interpersonal communications, composed content, line of business (LOB) application documents), and for prioritizing and routing the quick tasks to the user via an audio channel at an appropriate and relevant time. The system is enabled to process a user response, determine an action for handling the quick task, and execute the action on behalf of the user (e.g., pass a reply to a requestor, pass an instruction to an application or service, queue the quick task notification, delegate the quick task to another user or bot, forward the quick task to a companion device, or launch an application on a companion device).

<claims>
We claim:
1. A system for providing automated quick task notifications via an audio channel, the system comprising: at least one processing device; and at least one computer readable data storage device storing instructions that, when executed by the at least one processing device, cause the system to: provide an interface engine operative to receive a structured or unstructured content item associated with a user from a content source; provide a classifier operative to: identify a task expressed in the content item; determine whether the identified task is a quick task, wherein a quick task is a task that is amenable to being presented via an audio channel and can be processed with a quick action; and in response to a determination that the identified task is a quick task: rank the identified quick task based on a calculated prioritization score; and determine, based on one or a combination of the calculated prioritization score and monitored context data, whether conditions are favorable for exposing the identified quick task to the user via an audio channel; and provide an output manager operative to: in response to a determination that conditions are favorable for exposing the identified quick task to the user via an audio channel: generate a quick task notification; and pass the quick task notification to a client computing device with which the user is associated, such that an audio output device executing on the client computing device can produce an audible presentation of the quick task notification on the client computing device that can be heard through a speaker.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is further operative to provide a response handler operative to: receive a user response to the quick task notification; process the user response for determining an action to take based on the identified quick task and the user response; and execute the determined action.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the determined action is one of: delegating the identified quick task to another user or bot; queuing the quick task notification in a task store; or passing an instruction to a task action actor.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the task action actor comprises one of: a personal digital assistant; a line of business application; an email application; a messaging application; or a calendar application.
5. The system of claim 3, wherein in queuing the quick task notification in the task store, the system is further operative to: generate a quick task notification comprising a description of the identified quick task and contextual trigger criteria; store the quick task notification in the task store; monitor context data for the user and one or more client computing devices associated with the user for determining when the contextual trigger criteria have been satisfied; and when a determination is made that the contextual trigger criteria have been satisfied, pass the quick task notification to a client computing device with which the user is associated for presentation of the quick task notification to the user.
6. The system of claim 2, wherein the system is further operative to provide a feedback manager operative to: collect user feedback, wherein user feedback includes one or more of: explicit user feedback; and implicit user feedback; tune one or more of the interface engine, classifier, and the response handler using the collected user feedback for training one or more of the interface engine, classifier, and the response handler to take a desired action in the future.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein in identifying the task expressed in the content item, the classifier is operative to: identify one of: an explicit task item; a request made of the user to perform a task action; or a commitment made by the user to perform a task action.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein amenability to presentation via the audio channel is determined based on at least one of: a determination of possible responses to the task; whether a companion device with a screen is needed to handle the task; whether an application needed to process the task is operable on the client computing device with which the user is associated; and whether a network on which the client computing device is connected satisfies a network requirement for processing the task.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the quick action comprises at least one of: a communication response; approving or denying a request; sending content; passing an instruction to a task action actor; and scheduling a calendar item.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the prioritization score is calculated based on one or a combination of an inferred importance and relevance of the identified quick task to the user, wherein importance is inferred based on one or a combination of content and attributes extracted from the identified quick task comprising: user-selected priority; a relevant date; location; an indication of urgency; task subject matter; people; and age of the identified quick task.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein in making the determination that conditions are favorable for exposing the identified quick task to the user via the audio channel, the output manager is operative to calculate a condition favorability score, wherein the condition favorability score indicates a level of intrusiveness associated with a level of disruption of an audibly-played quick task, via a speaker, to the user or to processes executing on the user's client computing device, and is calculated based on the user's context and the context of the user's client computing device.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein when a determination is made that conditions are not favorable for exposing the identified quick task to the user via an audio channel, the output manager is operative to: generate a quick task notification comprising a description of the identified quick task and contextual trigger criteria; and store the quick task notification in a task store.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the system is further operative to: monitor context data for the user and one or more client computing devices associated with the user for determining when the contextual trigger criteria have been satisfied; and when a determination is made that the contextual trigger criteria have been satisfied, pass the quick task notification to the client computing device with which the user is associated for presentation of the quick task notification to the user.
14. A computer-implemented method for providing automated quick task notifications via an audio channel, the method comprising: receiving a structured or unstructured content item associated with a user from a content source; identifying a task expressed in the content item; determining whether the identified task is a quick task, wherein a quick task is a task that is amenable to being presented via an audio channel and can be processed with a quick action; and in response to a determination that the identified task is a quick task: ranking the identified quick task based on a calculated prioritization score; determining, based on one or a combination of the calculated prioritization score and context data, whether conditions are favorable for exposing the identified quick task to the user via an audio channel; and in response to a determination that conditions are favorable for exposing the identified quick task to the user via an audio channel: generating a quick task notification; and passing the quick task notification to a client computing device with which the user is associated, such that an audio output device executing on the client computing device can produce an audible presentation of the quick task notification on the computing device that can be heard through a speaker.
15.
