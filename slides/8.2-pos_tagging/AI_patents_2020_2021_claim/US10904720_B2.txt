<title>
Deriving signal location information and removing private information from it
</title>

<abstract>
The invention extends to methods, systems, and computer program products for deriving signal location information removing private information. A privacy infrastructure can apply data privacy operations to user information prior to, during, or after any of signal ingestion, event detection, or event notification. A raw signal is ingested. A partially normalized signal is derived from the raw signal. A list of one or more geo cells where the raw signal potentially originated is accessed. A location annotation identifying a geo cell from among the one or more geo cells can be formulated. The partially normalized signal is annotated with the location annotation. In one aspect, deriving the partially normalized signal includes identifying user information contained within the raw signal. At least one data privacy operation is applied to the user information. The partially normalized signal is generated subsequent to applying the at least one data privacy operation.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: ingesting a raw signal; deriving a partially normalized signal from the raw signal; identifying user information contained within the raw signal; modifying the partially normalized signal by applying a data privacy operation to the user information to thereby generate a modified partially normalized signal; accessing a list of one or more geo cells where the raw signal potentially originated; and annotating the partially normalized signal with a location annotation identifying a geo cell from among the one or more geo cells.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein said applying the data privacy operation comprises permanently eliminating the user information; and wherein modifying the partially normalized signal comprises altering the partially normalized signal to remove the user information.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein said applying the data privacy operation comprises applying a cryptographic operation to at least a portion of the user information.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein said identifying the user information contained within the raw signal comprises identifying one or more of: confidential information, patient information, personally identifiable information (PII), personal health information (PHI), sensitive personal information (SPI), or Payment Card Industry information (PCI) contained within the raw signal.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein said applying the data privacy operation to the user information comprises applying the data privacy operation to one or more of: confidential information, patient information, personally identifiable information (PII), personal health information (PHI), sensitive personal information (SPI), or Payment Card Industry information (PCI).
6. The method of claim 1, wherein said applying the data privacy operation to the user information comprises temporarily obscuring the user information.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein said deriving the partially normalized signal from the raw signal comprises: submitting a region to location services; receiving a region ID corresponding to the region from the location services; and inserting the region ID into the partially normalized signal.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein said accessing the list of one or more geo cells where the raw signal potentially originated comprises: recognizing a named entity in content of the raw signal; querying a geo cell database with the named entity; and receiving the list of one or more geo cells from the geo cell database.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein said ingesting the raw signal comprises ingesting one of: a social signal, a web signal, or a streaming signal.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising formulating the location annotation in view of a probability that the raw signal is originated within the list of the one or more geo cells.
11. A computer system comprising: a processor; system memory coupled to the processor and storing instructions configured to cause the processor to: ingest a raw signal; derive a partially normalized signal from the raw signal; identify user information contained within the raw signal; modify the partially normalized signal by applying a data privacy operation to the user information to thereby generate a modified partially normalized signal; access a list of one or more geo cells where the raw signal potentially originated; and annotate the partially normalized signal with a location annotation identifying a geo cell from among the one or more geo cells.
12. The computer system of claim 11, wherein the instructions configured to apply the data privacy operation comprise instructions configured to permanently eliminate the user information; and wherein the instructions configured to generate the partially normalized signal comprise instructions configured to generate the modified partially normalized signal without the user information.
13. The computer system of claim 11, wherein the instructions configured to said applying the data privacy operation comprise instructions configured to apply a cryptographic operation to at least a portion of the user information.
14. The computer system of claim 11, wherein the instructions configured to identify the user information contained within the raw signal comprise instructions configured to identify one or more of: confidential information, patient information, personally identifiable information (PII), personal health information (PHI), sensitive personal information (SPI), or Payment Card Industry information (PCI) contained within the raw signal.
15. The computer system of claim 11, wherein the instructions configured to apply the data privacy operation to the user information comprise instructions configured to apply the data privacy operation to one or more of: confidential information, patient information, personally identifiable information (PII), personal health information (PHI), sensitive personal information (SPI), or Payment Card Industry information (PCI).
16. The computer system of claim 11, wherein the instructions configured to apply the data privacy operation to the user information comprise instructions configured to temporarily obscure the user information.
17. The computer system of claim 11, wherein the instructions configured to derive the partially normalized signal from the raw signal comprise instructions configured to: submit a region to location services; receive a region ID corresponding to the region from the location services; and insert the region ID into the partially normalized signal.
18. The computer system of claim 11, wherein the instructions configured to access the list of one or more geo cells where the raw signal potentially originated comprise instructions configured to: recognize a named entity in content of the raw signal; query a geo cell database with the named entity; and receive the list of one or more geo cells from the geo cell database.
19. The computer system of claim 11, wherein the instructions configured to ingest the raw signal comprise instructions configured to ingest one of: a social signal, a web signal, or a streaming signal.
20. The computer system of claim 11, further comprising instructions configured to formulate the location annotation in view of a probability that the raw signal is originated within the list of the one or more geo cells.
