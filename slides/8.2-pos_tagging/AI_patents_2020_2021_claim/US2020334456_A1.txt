IDENTIFYING VERSIONS OF A FORM
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are a method and apparatus for identifying versions of a form. In an example, clients of a medical company fill out many forms, and many of these forms have multiple versions. The medical company operates in 10 states, and each state has a different version of a client intake form, as well as of an insurance identification form. In order to automatically extract information from a particular filled out form, it may be helpful to identify a particular form template, as well as the version of the form template, of which the filled out form is an instance. A computer system evaluates images of filled out forms, and identifies various form templates and versions of form templates based on the images.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving a plurality of images of forms; initializing a plurality of clusters based on the plurality of images, wherein each cluster of the plurality of clusters includes an exemplar image that is one of the plurality of images; aligning exemplar images from two clusters of the plurality of clusters based on keypoints of the exemplar images; computing a form similarity score based on the alignment of the exemplar images; when the first form similarity score is above a predetermined threshold, merging the two clusters into a same cluster of the plurality of clusters; and identifying form images from one cluster of the plurality of clusters as being versions of a same template form based on the form images being in the one cluster.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining a single template form associated with each of the plurality of clusters via registration of a single image of each of the plurality of clusters of forms against a set template forms; and assign all forms in each cluster to a particular template form based on said determining.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the similarity score is based on a sub-comparisons of predetermined regions of each of the plurality of images, wherein the predetermined regions are based on regions of a set of template forms that are most indicative of variations between a plurality of form versions.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the predetermined regions are based on the keypoints in the plurality of images.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein said computing is based on a threshold of matching vector elements, wherein the vector elements describe each of the plurality of images.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein said computing further includes: assigning a class label to each vector element in the respective image.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein said computing is performed using a trained machine learning model that receives vectors and outputs a confidence of similarity score.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the confidence of similarity score is based on a "k-nearest neighbors" classification.
9. A method comprising: receiving a plurality of images of forms, each of the plurality of images is associated with one of a plurality of form versions; dividing each of the plurality of images into sub images, each sub image is a region of a respective image, each sub image includes metadata tying the sub image to the region of the respective image; converting each sub image into a vector, wherein the vector describes the content of the sub image; comparing each vector with other vectors describing a matching region of the respective image based on the metadata; and sorting the plurality of images of forms into matching categories based on form version, the sorting based on said comparing each vector.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising: for each category, identify the form version based on registration of a single image of the plurality of images of forms that is sorted into the respective category; and assign all forms in each category a particular form version based on said identifying.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein each region of the respective image included in each sub image is predetermined based on regions of the plurality of images that are most indicative of variations between the plurality of form versions.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the predetermined regions are based on keypoints in the plurality of images.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein said comparison is based on a threshold of matching vector elements.
14. The method of claim 9, wherein said comparison further includes: assigning a class label to each vector found in the respective image.
15. The method of claim 9, wherein said comparison is performed using a trained machine learning model that receives vectors and outputs a confidence of similarity score.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the confidence of similarity score is based on a "k-nearest neighbors" classification.
17. A system comprising: an image processor configured to receiving a plurality of images of forms, wherein each of the plurality of images is associated with one of a plurality of form versions, the image processor further configured to divide each of the plurality of images into sub images, each sub image is a region of a respective image, each sub image includes metadata tying the sub image to the region of the respective image, and the image processor is configured to convert each sub image into a vector, wherein the vector describes the content of the sub image; and a memory including a trained machine learning model configured to compare each vector with other vectors describing a matching region of the respective image based on the metadata and sort the plurality of images of forms into matching categories based on form version, the sorting based on said comparing each vector.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the image processor is further configured to identify the form version based on registration of a single image of each category the plurality of images of forms are sorted into by the machine learning model and assign all forms in each category a particular form version based on the identification.
19. The system of claim 17, wherein each region of the respective image included in each sub image is predetermined based on regions of the plurality of images that are most indicative of variations between the plurality of form versions.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein the predetermined regions are based on keypoints in the plurality of images.
21. The system of claim 17, wherein said comparison is based on a threshold of matching vector elements.
22. The system of claim 17, wherein said comparison further includes assignment of a class label to each vector found in the respective image.
