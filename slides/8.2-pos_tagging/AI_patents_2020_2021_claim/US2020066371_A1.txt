METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR 3D STRUCTURE ESTIMATION
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein are systems and methods for efficient 3D structure estimation from images of a transmissive object, including cryo-EM images. The method generally comprises, receiving a set of 2D images of a target specimen from an electron microscope, carrying out a reconstruction technique to determine a likely molecular structure, and outputting the estimated 3D structure of the specimen. The described reconstruction technique comprises: establishing a probabilistic model of the target structure; optimizing using stochastic optimization to determine which structure is most likely; and, optionally utilizing importance sampling to minimize computational burden.

4. The system of claim 1, wherein the probabilistic model comprises a likelihood function marginalized over 3D orientations and 2D shifts of the at least one target in the particle images, the marginalization being effected on a generative model of the 3D density of the at least one target.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein utilizing Stochastic Average Gradient Descent comprises, iteratively, selecting a mini batch of particle images, computing a gradient of the log of the likelihood function with respect to 3D density for the mini batch of particle images, and adding the gradient to a running total.
