<title>
SYSTEMS, DEVICES, AND METHODS FOR PERFORMING ACTIVE AUSCULTATION AND DETECTING SONIC ENERGY MEASUREMENTS
</title>

<abstract>
Active auscultation may be used to determine organ (e.g., lung or heart) characteristics of users. An acoustic or piezo-electric signal (e.g., a pulse, a tone, and/or a broadband pulse) may be projected into an animal (typically human) body or thorax. The signal interacts with the body, or lungs, and in some cases may induce resonance within the body/lungs. A resultant signal may be emitted from the body which may be analyzed to determine, for example, a lung's resonant frequency or frequencies and/or how the sound is otherwise absorbed, reflected, or modified by the body. This information may be indicative of lung characteristics such as lung capacity, a volume of air trapped in the lungs, and/or the presence of COPD.

<claims>
1. A method of performing active auscultation comprising: directing a acoustic signal that includes a series of pseudo-randomly selected frequencies into a user's body toward a target of interest; receiving an acoustic signal from the user's body, the received acoustic signal corresponding to the acoustic signal; and determining a characteristic of the received acoustic signal, wherein the characteristic is at least one of an intensity and a frequency of the received acoustic signal.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the acoustic signal is a first acoustic signal and the received acoustic signal is a first received acoustic signal, the method further comprising: receiving a second acoustic signal from the user's body, the received acoustic signal corresponding to a second acoustic signal projected into the user's body; determining a characteristic of the second received acoustic signal, wherein the characteristic of the second received acoustic signal is at least one of an intensity and a frequency of the second received acoustic signal; comparing a characteristic of the first and second received acoustic signals; and providing an indication of the comparison to an operator.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: comparing the characteristic of the acoustic signal to a predetermined value.
4. The method of claim 1, furthering comprising: adjusting at least one of a duration of the signal, an intensity of the signal, and frequencies included in the signal responsively to the determined characteristics of the acoustic signal.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the signal comprises a plurality of frequencies between 2,000 Hz and 30,000 Hz.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the acoustic signal is directed toward the target for a time period lasting between 0.1 seconds and 2 seconds.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the target is at least one of a heart and a lung of the user.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the target is the user's lung, the method further comprising: determining a volume of air trapped in the user's lung responsively to the determined characteristic.
9. A method comprising: receiving, by a processor, a detected acoustic signal from a receiver, the detected acoustic signal corresponding to an acoustic signal directed toward a target within the body of a user in a pulse and responsively emanating from the user, the acoustic signal comprising a series of pseudo-randomly selected frequencies; and analyzing, by the processor, the received acoustic signal to determine a resonant frequency for the target.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the target is the user's lung, the method further comprising: determining, by the processor, a volume of trapped air present in the user's lung responsively to the resonant frequency.
11. The method of claim 9, any of claim 9 or 10, further comprising: comparing the resonant frequency of the target to a predetermined value.
12. The method of claim 9, furthering comprising: adjusting at least one of a duration, an intensity of the signal stimuli, and frequencies included in the signal stimuli responsively to the determined resonant frequency of the target.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein the signal includes signals within a range of 2,000 Hz and 30,000 Hz.
14. A method for performing active auscultation comprising: providing, by a processor in communication with an emitter, signal stimuli to the emitter so that the emitter produces acoustic energy that includes a series of pseudo-randomly selected frequencies, the acoustic energy being directed towards an organ of a user; receiving, by the processor, via a receiver in communication with the processor, an acoustic energy response that corresponds to the acoustic energy directed towards to the organ; and analyzing, by the processor, the received acoustic energy response to determine a resonant frequency for the organ.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the plurality of frequencies directed towards the organ includes a set of discrete frequencies.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the signal stimuli cause the emitter to produce acoustic energy that cycles through the set of discrete frequencies over a predetermined period of time.
17. (canceled)
18. The method of claim 14, wherein signal stimuli cause the emitter to produce a burst of acoustic energy that includes the plurality of pseudo-randomly selected frequencies.
19. The method of claim 14, further comprising: determining, by the processor, a volume of air trapped in the organ based on the resonant frequency for the organ.
20. The method of claim 14, further comprising: receiving, by the processor, information pertaining to the user; and correlating, by the processor, the received information with the resonant frequency of the organ.
21. The method of claim 20, wherein the received information pertains to one or more of a physiological characteristic of a user, a diagnosis of a user, a size of the organ, a shape of the organ, a type of fluid in the organ, a type of gas in the organ, a location of the emitter, a location of the receiver, a level of ambient noise, and an orientation of a user.
22. The method of claim 14, wherein signal stimuli cause the emitter to produce an acoustic signal with one or more of a predetermined frequency response and a predetermined frequency bin.
