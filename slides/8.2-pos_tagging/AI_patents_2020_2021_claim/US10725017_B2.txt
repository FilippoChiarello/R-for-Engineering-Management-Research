<title>
Prediction of therapeutic response using vibrational spectroscopy
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a prognostic method of analyzing a biological sample from a cancer patient to predict his/her response to a specified modality of cancer treatment comprising the steps of: (a) performing spectroscopy on the biological sample to obtain a spectrum; (b) comparing the obtained spectrum with one or more spectra to calculate a probability of a response to the specified modality of cancer treatment by the cancer patient.

<claims>
1. A prognostic method of analyzing a biological biofluid sample from a cancer patient to predict the patient's response to a specified modality of cancer treatment, the prognostic method comprising: obtaining diagnosis of a cancer patient, wherein the cancer is selected from esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer; obtaining the biological biofluid sample from the cancer patient; performing spectroscopy on the biological sample to obtain a spectrum; and comparing the obtained spectrum with one or more spectra from a pre-classified library to calculate a probability of a response to the specified modality of cancer treatment by the cancer patient.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the modality of cancer treatment is selected from a group consisting of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and radiotherapy combined with either chemotherapy or hormonal therapy.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the modality of cancer treatment comprises radiotherapy.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the biological biofluid sample is unirradiated.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the biological biofluid sample is a blood sample.
6. The method of claim 5, comprising irradiating the in-vitro blood sample.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein: the blood sample is used whole and analyzed; or plasma or lymphocytes are extracted from the blood sample and analyzed.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein plasma is extracted and analyzed and the steps for analyzing the plasma are as follows: extracting plasma from the blood sample; depositing the plasma on a substrate; acquiring Raman/FTIR spectra; analyzing the obtained spectra by a statistical learning algorithm which compares the obtained spectra to spectra from a pre-classified library; and predicting response to therapy based on the analysis of the immediately preceding step.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein lymphocytes are extracted and analyzed and the steps for analyzing the lymphocytes are as follows: extracting lymphocytes from the blood sample; fixing the lymphocytes; depositing the fixed lymphocytes on a substrate; acquiring Raman/FTIR spectra; analyzing the obtained spectra by a statistical learning algorithm which compares the obtained spectra to spectra from a pre-classified library; and predicting response to therapy based on the analysis of the immediately preceding step.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the biological biofluid sample is a blood lymphocyte sample.
11. The method of claim 10, comprising culturing blood lymphocyte cells as whole blood in-vitro.
