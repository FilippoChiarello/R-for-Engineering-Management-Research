SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ANALYZING USER-SUPPLIED MEDIA AT A SPORTING EVENT
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method of analyzing and presenting user-supplied media at a sporting event is described herein. A user may collect data using a mobile device at a sporting event. The data may be analyzed by an application on the mobile device to determine if the data comprises an event at the sporting event. The data may be combined with data from a plurality of mobile devices to create a combined data set for distribution. The fan may be rewarded for the contribution to the combined data set.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of analyzing user-supplied media at a sporting event, the method comprising the steps of: collecting data from a mobile device at the sporting event, wherein the data is indicative of activities at the sporting event; determining that the data is indicative of an event; distributing the data for broadcast of the event; and providing rewards to a user of the mobile device based at least in part on the data.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising the steps of: performing a first analysis to determine if the data meets a first threshold for quality; and performing a second analysis to determine if the data meets requirements for distribution.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of providing rewards to the user of the mobile device based at least in part on the data.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of processing the data for display and distribution of the event; wherein the event is displayed on at least one of social media, broadcast television, radio, and a display at the sporting event.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising the step of tracking at least one of a quantity of shares and a quantity of views of the event and comparing information indicative of the event with historic information to determine a potential indicator of the quantity of shares and the quantity of views.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising the step of selecting at least one set of data based on the comparison of information indicative of the event with the historic information.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising the steps of: analyzing sensor data from the mobile device to determine at least one of time and orientation of the mobile device, and determining a likelihood that the event was captured by at least one other mobile device.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising the step of combining the set of data with secondary data from the at least one other mobile device when it is determined that the at least one other mobile device is oriented to capture the event.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of initiating storage of the data when it is determined that a triggering event has occurred, wherein the data is pre-recorded such that data prior to storage initiation is stored.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the triggering event is detected by at least one of an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a microphone, and a camera associated with the mobile device.
11. The method of claim 9, further comprising the step of sending a notification to at least one other user when the at least one other user is within a specified proximity of the sporting event.
12. A method of analyzing user-supplied media at a sporting event, the method comprising the steps of: collecting data from a mobile device at the sporting event, wherein the data is indicative of activities at the sporting event; determining at least one marker from the data, wherein the at least one marker is indicative of an event; and providing rewards to a user of the mobile device based at least in part on the data.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the data is a first set of data; and further comprising the step of combining the first set of data with a second set of data, wherein the second set of data comprises the at least one marker.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the at least one marker comprises at least one of a location of the event, an orientation of the mobile device, and a location of the mobile device.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein the at least one marker comprises at least one of an artificial reality marker, an object at the sporting event, a sound.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the second set of data is collected by a second fan attending the sporting event, and wherein the second fan is rewarded for submitting the second set of data.
17. One or more non-transitory computer-readable media storing computer-executable instructions that, when executed by a processor, perform a method of analyzing user-supplied media at a sporting event, the method comprising the steps of: collecting a first set of data from a first mobile device at the sporting event, wherein the first set of data is indicative of activities at the sporting event; determining at least one marker in the first set of data; collecting a second set of data from a second mobile device at the sporting event; wherein the second set of data is indicative of the activities at the sporting event; and combining the first set of data and the second set of data to create a combined set of data based at least in part on the at least one marker.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the at least one marker is indicative of a product associated with the sporting event; and further comprising the step of determining if the second set of data comprises the at least one marker.
19. The method of claim 18, further comprising the steps of: displaying the combined set of data on at least one of a social media platform, a display at the sporting event, broadcast television, and a live-streaming platform; tracking a distribution of the combined set of data; and analyzing and comparing the combined set of data to saved data to determine correlations to the distribution.
20. The method of claim 18, further comprising the step of initiating storage of the first set of data when it is determined that the at least one marker is obtained.
