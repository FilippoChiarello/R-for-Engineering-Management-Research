<title>
INTERACTIVE LIBRARY SYSTEM AND METHOD OF INTERACTIVE, REAL-TIME CREATION AND CUSTOMIZATION
</title>

<abstract>
An interactive library system comprised of a Processing Engine phase, a Presentation Engine phase, a Content Management phase, and a Content Editing/Reading pages phase, which work together in real time. The system, by providing a set of structures within an overarching database, provides the flexibility to build any data set (library) within an overarching data schema. The system proactively presents information to a user in real time as the system constantly scans to finds library matches to user text, saving the user from having to actively search and confirm information and greatly enhancing data handling capability. Further, each user has the flexibility to create a library most relevant to a user's particular position and needs, and select information for retrieval most useful to them.

<claims>
1. A method of providing an interactive user library system, comprising: providing at least one electronic device with a user interface, the at least one electronic device comprised of either a server and at least one access electronic device, or at least one access electronic device, providing an account management phase and respective software, providing a content reading/editing phase and respective software, providing a processing engine phase and respective software, and providing a presentation engine phase and respective software, wherein the account management phase is further comprised of interactive library extension software and an installation interface to assist in installing system extension software, user library software that allows a user to access a pre-made library, create a library, import a library from an internal or external source, or any combination thereof, and wherein the content reading/editing phase is further comprised of a library management interface and respective library management software capable of assisting a user in accessing a library, importing a library, creating a customized library, editing a library, managing a library, using a library, ordering a library, arranging a library, acquiring a library, assigning formats to a library, deleting a library, or any combination thereof, a library management interface further comprised of at least one record field and at least one attribute field, wherein the processing engine phase is further comprised of software capable of processing user-derived data by continuously comparing the user-derived data to at least one system library to determine if there are any matches between the user-derived data and the at least one system library, finding any matches, and reformatting the user-derived text to signal each match, an accompanying processing interface for processing text, and execution software capable of providing data about each matching library record by supplying attribute information about each matching library record, wherein the presentation engine is capable of adding match attribute information to user-derived matching text for user review, and is further comprised of a respective system use interface capable of displaying attribute information of each library match to user-derived text, and wherein the processing engine phase is capable of receiving data from one or more user-created libraries, non-user created libraries, or a combination thereof.
