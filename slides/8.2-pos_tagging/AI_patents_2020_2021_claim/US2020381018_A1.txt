TAGGING TRACKED OBJECTS IN A VIDEO WITH METADATA
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments herein describe a video editor that can identify and track objects (e.g., products) in a video. The video editor identifies a particular object in one frame of the video and tracks the location of the object in the video. The video editor can update a position of an indicator that tracks the location of the object in the video. In addition, the video editor can identify an identification (ID) of the object which the editor can use to suggest annotations that provide additional information about the object. Once modified, the video is displayed on a user device, and when the viewer sees an object she can is interested in, she can pause the video which causes the indicator to appear. The user can select the indicator which prompts the user device to display the annotations corresponding to the object.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: a processor; and a memory storing instructions, wherein, when executed on the processor, the instructions perform an operation, the operation comprising: storing frames of a video; storing location information of an object in the frames; storing an annotation corresponding to the object, wherein the annotation provides additional information about the object; transmitting the frames to be displayed; detecting that the video was paused on one of the frames containing the object; transmitting, for display, an indicator identifying a location of the object in the paused frame; detecting that a user has selected at least one of the indicator or the object in the paused frame; and transmitting the annotation to be displayed on the paused frame.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the indicator is a bounding box surrounding the object.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the indicator is displayed after determining the video was paused and that the object is in the paused frame.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the annotation is transmitted to be displayed in response to detecting that the user has selected at least one of the indicator or the object in the paused frame.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the annotation is a pop-up graphic that occludes at least a portion of the paused frame.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the pop-up graphic comprises an selectable element for purchasing the object, wherein the object is a product for sale.
7. The system of claim 5, wherein the pop-up graphic comprises a link to another segment in the video that includes the object.
8. A computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable program code embodied therewith, the computer-readable program code executable by one or more computer processors to perform an operation, the operation comprising: storing frames of a video; storing an annotation corresponding to an object in the frames, wherein the annotation provides additional information about the object; transmitting the frames to be displayed; detecting that the video was paused on one of the frames containing the object; transmitting, for display, an indicator identifying a location of the object in the paused frame; detecting that a user has selected at least one of the indicator or the object in the paused frame; and transmitting the annotation to be displayed on the paused frame.
9. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 8, wherein the indicator is a bounding box surrounding the object.
10. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 8, wherein the indicator is displayed after determining the video was paused and that the object is in the paused frame.
11. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 8, wherein the annotation is transmitted to be displayed in response to detecting that the user has selected at least one of the indicator or the object in the paused frame.
12. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 8, wherein the annotation is a pop-up graphic that occludes at least a portion of the paused frame.
13. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein the pop-up graphic comprises an selectable element for purchasing the object, wherein the object is a product for sale.
14. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein the pop-up graphic comprises a link to another segment in the video that includes the object.
15. A method, comprising: storing frames of a video; storing an annotation corresponding to an object in the frames, wherein the annotation provides additional information about the object; transmitting the frames to be displayed; detecting that the video was paused on one of the frames containing the object; transmitting, for display, an indicator identifying a location of the object in the paused frame; detecting that a user has selected at least one of the indicator or the object in the paused frame; and transmitting the annotation to be displayed on the paused frame.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the indicator is a bounding box surrounding the object.
17. The method of claim 15, wherein the indicator is displayed after determining the video was paused and that the object is in the paused frame.
18. The method of claim 15, wherein the annotation is transmitted to be displayed in response to detecting that the user has selected at least one of the indicator or the object in the paused frame.
19. The method of claim 15, wherein the annotation is a pop-up graphic that occludes at least a portion of the paused frame.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein the pop-up graphic comprises an selectable element for purchasing the object, wherein the object is a product for sale, and wherein the pop-up graphic comprises a link to another segment in the video that includes the object.
