<title>
VIRTUAL STAINING OF CELLS IN DIGITAL HOLOGRAPHIC MICROSCOPY IMAGES USING GENERAL ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS
</title>

<abstract>
A cell visualization system includes a digital holographic microscopy (DHM) device, a training device, and a virtual staining device. The DHM device produces DHM images of cells and the virtual staining device colorizes the DHM images based on an algorithm generated by the training device using generative adversarial networks and unpaired training data. A computer-implemented method for producing a virtually stained DHM image includes acquiring an image conversion algorithm which was trained using the generative adversarial networks, receiving a DHM image with depictions of one or more cells and virtually staining the DHM image by processing the DHM image using the image conversion algorithm. The virtually stained DHM image includes digital colorization of the one or more cells to imitate the appearance of a corresponding actually stained cell.
