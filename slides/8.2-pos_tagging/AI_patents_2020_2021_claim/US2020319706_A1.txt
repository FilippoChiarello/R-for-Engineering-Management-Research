SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETECTING INVISIBLE HUMAN EMOTION IN A RETAIL ENVIRONMENT
</title>

<abstract>
A system for detecting invisible human emotion in a retail environment is provided. The system comprises a camera and an image processing unit. The camera is configured in a retail environment to capture an image sequence of a person before and during when a price of a product or service becomes visible. The image processing unit is trained to determine a set of bitplanes of a plurality of images in the captured image sequence that represent the hemoglobin concentration (HC) changes of the person, and to detect the person's invisible emotional states based on HC changes. The image processing unit is trained using a training set comprising a set of subjects for which emotional state is known.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A system for determining probability for a state of human emotion among a set of identifiable states of human emotion from a digital image sequence of a person in a retail environment, the system comprising: a computer-readable memory comprising the digital image sequence, the digital image sequence being of light re-emitted from the skin of the person before and during viewing of a product; and a processing unit comprising one or more processors in communication with the computer-readable memory, the image processing unit executable to: determine, using a first machine learning model trained with a hemoglobin concentration (HC) training set, HC changes of the person using bit values from each bitplane of images in the captured image sequence, the HC training set comprising bit values from each bitplane of images captured from one or more people while such people experience a known state of emotion; and determine a measure of probability, using a second machine learning model trained with a state training set, for the emotional state of the person against each of the set of identifiable states of human emotion, the state training set obtained by receiving bit values from each bitplane of images representing HC changes determined by the first machine learning model.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein determining the measure of probability, using the second machine learning model trained with the state training set, for the emotional state of the person further comprises determining a normalized intensity measure for the emotional state.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the person views the product before and during a point of sale event comprising a price display device displaying a price.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the point of sale event comprises the price display device temporarily displaying a discounted price.
5. The system of claim 3, wherein the captured image sequence is received from a camera that is integral to the price display device.
6. The system of claim 5, further comprising a motion sensor to detect motion in a region proximal the product display, and to, upon detecting motion in the region, trigger the camera to capture the image sequence and the price display device to display the price.
7. The system of claim 5, wherein the processing unit is configured to receive locations of the camera and the product, to perform gaze tracking to analyze the image sequence to determine whether the person is looking at the product during the point of sale event, and to discard the image sequence if the person is not looking at the product during the point of sale event.
8. The system of claim 1, further comprising outputting of the detected emotional state with the highest measure of probability to a display.
9. A method for determining probability for a state of human emotion among a set of identifiable states of human emotion from a digital image sequence of a person in a retail environment, the digital image sequence being of light re-emitted from the skin of the person before and during viewing of a product, the method comprising: determining, using a first machine learning model trained with a hemoglobin concentration (HC) training set, HC changes of the person using bit values from each bitplane of images in the captured image sequence, the HC training set comprising bit values from each bitplane of images captured from one or more people while such people experience a known state of emotion; and determinizing a measure of probability, using a second machine learning model trained with a state training set, for the emotional state of the person against each of the set of identifiable states of human emotion, the state training set obtained by receiving bit values from each bitplane of images representing HC changes determined by the first machine learning model.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein determining the measure of probability, using the second machine learning model trained with the state training set, for the emotional state of the person further comprises determining a normalized intensity measure for the emotional state.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the person views the product before and during a point of sale event comprising a displaying a price.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the point of sale event comprises temporarily displaying a discounted price.
13. The method of claim 11, further comprising detecting motion in a region proximal the product, and, upon detecting motion in the region, capturing the image sequence and displaying the price.
14. The method of claim 11, further comprising performing gaze tracking to analyze the image sequence to determine whether the person is looking at the product during the point of sale event, and discarding the image sequence if the person is not looking at the product during the point of sale event.
15. The method of claim 9, further comprising outputting of the detected emotional state with the highest measure of probability.
