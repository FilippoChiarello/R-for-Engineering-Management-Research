SYSTEMS AND TECHNIQUES TO QUANTIFY STRENGTH OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ENTERPRISE
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are a system, apparatus and techniques for training a model to account for a relationship depth of an enterprise user with an enterprise. A machine learning engine may evaluate a machine learning model using user-related generalized data drawn from multiple service areas of the enterprise, data sources external to the enterprise, or both as an input or inputs to quantify the relationship depth. A relationship depth value may be generated that is representative of a user a dept.
