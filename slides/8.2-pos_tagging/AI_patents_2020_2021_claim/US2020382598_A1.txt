<title>
Localized Situational Intelligent Awareness from Multiple Sensor Types Through a 4-Dimensional State System
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention describes a computer implemented method for training a home monitoring system comprising of a plurality of occupational sensors, a plurality of computing devices, and a server network that communicate over a network. The plurality of occupational sensors can transmit information from the occupational sensors to the server; upon receiving the information from the plurality of occupational sensors, the server can generate and maintain a three-dimensional model of the environment. The server can then identify a first action performed by the special needs user based on the three-dimensional model of the environment and the information from the plurality of occupational sensors. Upon identifying the first action performed by the user, the server can determine a second action to be performed by a computing device; the server then transmits the second action to be performed to the computing device, which can then perform the second action.

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method for training a home monitoring system comprising: a plurality of occupational sensors; a plurality of computing devices; a server network; wherein the plurality of occupational sensors transmits information from the occupational sensors to the server; upon receiving the information from one or more of the plurality of occupational sensors, the server generates and maintains a three-dimensional model of the environment; the server identifies a first action performed by the special needs user based on the three-dimensional model of the environment and the information from one or more of the plurality of occupational sensors; upon identifying the first action performed by the user, the server determines a second action to be performed by a computing device; the server then transmits the second action to be performed to the computing device, which then performs the second action.
2. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the server identifies a third action performed by the user based on the three-dimensional model and information from one or more of the plurality of occupational sensors; upon identifying a third action performed by the user, the server determines a fourth action to be performed by the computing device to help the user; the server then transmits a fourth action to be performed to the computing device, which then performs a fourth action.
3. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the computing device modifies the three-dimensional model of the environment based on information from one or more of the plurality of occupational sensors as a difference in standard state.
4. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein one of the sensors in the plurality of sensors is an RGB depth sensor.
5. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein one of the sensors in the plurality of sensors is a thermal sensor.
6. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein one of the sensors in the plurality of sensors is an audio-visual sensor.
7. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein one of the sensors in the plurality of sensors is a microphone.
8. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein one of the sensors in the plurality of sensors is a motion sensor.
9. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the second action to be performed by the computing device is updating the status of the special needs user with a care-person.
10. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein after identifying the first action performed by the special needs user, the second action to be performed by the computing device is advising the special needs user about the next steps in the first action performed by the special needs user.
11. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the second action to be performed by the computing device is contacting an emergency service.
12. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the forth action to be performed by the computing device is updating the status of the special needs user with a care-person.
13. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein after identifying the third action performed by the special needs user, the forth action to be performed by the computing device is advising the special needs user about the next steps in the third action performed by the special needs user.
14. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the forth action to be performed by the computing device is contacting an emergency service.
