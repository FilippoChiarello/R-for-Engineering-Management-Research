<title>
Storage device including nonvolatile memory device, nonvolatile memory device, operating method of storage device
</title>

<abstract>
A storage device includes a controller and a nonvolatile memory device having memory cells and reference memory cells. The controller accesses first memory cells of the memory cells, reads first reference memory cells, which are associated with the first memory cells, from among the reference memory cells when the access to the first memory cells fails, determines a bad area depending on a read result of the first reference memory cells, and identifies second memory cells, which belong to the bad area, from among the memory cells to bad memory cells.

<claims>
1. A storage device comprising: a nonvolatile memory device including memory cells and reference memory cells; and a controller that: accesses first memory cells of the memory cells, reads, when the access to the first memory cells fails, first reference memory cells, among the reference memory cells, that are associated with the first memory cells but do not include the first memory cells, determines, based on a read result of the first reference memory cells, a bad area within the memory cells that includes the first memory cells, and identifies second memory cells, from among the memory cells, that belong to the bad area as bad memory cells.
2. The storage device of claim 1, wherein the controller transmits to the nonvolatile memory device: a first command for accessing the first memory cells, and a second command for reading the first reference memory cells when the nonvolatile memory device communicates an access fail to the controller.
3. The storage device of claim 2, wherein the controller: transmits to the nonvolatile memory device a third command for reading second reference memory cells, of the reference memory cells, and determines the bad area depending on results obtained by executing the second command and the third command.
4. The storage device of claim 1, wherein the first memory cells and the first reference memory cells are associated with a same string selection line and a same word line.
5. The storage device of claim 1, wherein the first memory cells and the first reference memory cells are associated with a same string selection line and a same bit line.
6. The storage device of claim 1, wherein when the access to the first memory cells fails due to a left-alone fail, the controller determines that the bad area does not exist.
7. The storage device of claim 1, wherein: the memory cells are connected to sub-word lines and two or more sub-word lines of the sub-word lines are grouped and connected to each of word lines, and when the access to the first memory cells fails due to a failure of a minority of the sub-word lines connected to a specific word line, the controller identifies the minority of the sub-word lines as the bad area.
8. The storage device of claim 1, wherein: the memory cells are connected to sub-word lines and two or more sub-word lines of the sub-word lines are grouped and connected to each of word lines, and when the access to the first memory cells fails due to a failure of a majority of the sub-word lines of connected to a specific word line, the controller identifies the specific word line as the bad area.
9. The storage device of claim 1, wherein: the nonvolatile memory device includes cell strings, disposed on a substrate in rows and columns, that include the memory cells, the memory cells of the cell strings are stacked in a direction perpendicular to the substrate, and when the access to the first memory cells fails due to a failure of a specific row, the controller identifies cell strings of the specific row, among the cell strings, as the bad area.
10. The storage device of claim 1, wherein: the nonvolatile memory device includes memory blocks, each of the memory blocks including the memory cells, and when the access to the first memory cells fails due to a failure of a specific memory block of the memory blocks and a specific cause of the failure is not determined, the controller identifies the specific memory block, to which the first memory cells belong, as the bad area.
11. The storage device of claim 1, wherein the access to the first memory cells is a write operation, a read operation, or an erase operation.
12. The storage device of claim 1, wherein the reference memory cells include dummy memory cells, selection transistors, reference memory cells storing reference data corresponding to a specific threshold voltage range, or memory cells used to store user data.
13. The storage device of claim 1, wherein the controller identifies the bad area depending on a threshold voltage distribution of the first reference memory cells.
14. The storage device of claim 1, wherein the controller compares a threshold voltage distribution of the first reference memory cells and a threshold voltage distribution of second reference memory cells of the reference memory cells to identify the bad area.
15. The storage device of claim 1, wherein: the controller identifies the bad area depending on fail information of the first memory cells and the read result of the first reference memory cells.
16. A nonvolatile memory device comprising: a memory cell array including memory cells and reference memory cells; a row decoder circuit connected to the memory cell array through word lines; a page buffer circuit connected to the memory cell array through bit lines; and a control logic circuit that controls: the row decoder circuit and the page buffer circuit to access first memory cells of the memory cells, and the row decoder circuit and the page buffer circuit to read first reference memory cells, which are associated with the first memory cells but do not include the first memory cells, when the access to the first memory cells fails, wherein the control logic circuit identifies, based on a read result of the first reference memory cells, a bad area within the memory cells that includes the first memory cells.
17. The nonvolatile memory device of claim 16, wherein the control logic circuit controls the page buffer circuit to output the read result of the first reference memory cells to an external device.
18. The nonvolatile memory device of claim 16, wherein the control logic circuit identifies the bad area depending on the read result of the first reference memory cells and outputs information of the bad area to an external device.
19. An operating method executed by a storage device that includes a controller and a nonvolatile memory device having memory cells and reference memory cells, the method comprising: accessing first memory cells of the memory cells; reading first reference memory cells, which are associated with the first memory cells but do not include the first memory cells, from among the reference memory cells when the access to the first memory cells fails; and identifying, based on a read result of the first reference memory cells, a bad area within the memory cells that includes the first memory cells.
