<title>
System for changing operation modes in a loyalty program
</title>

<abstract>
A method for changing operation modes includes receiving disaster information from trending data, a newsfeed, or an alert message; upon detecting at least one redirection trigger from the disaster information, configuring a loyalty system to operate in a redirection mode; receiving or accessing data associated with a transaction between a customer and a merchant; determining, from at least one of customer information and merchant information in the data associated with the transaction, a donation amount and a location associated with the transaction; when the loyalty system is configured to operate in a redirection mode, generating signals to cause accrual of at least a portion of the donation amount to a redirection account based on the location associated with the transaction; and generating signals to cause accrual of any remaining portion of the donation amount to one or more defined donation accounts based on charity catchment area parameters.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving disaster information for a disaster including a plurality of scores each being selected from the group consisting of: an event impact value representing a relative metric for an extent of the disaster; a response value representing a currency amount to remedy or for a relief effort for the disaster; and a donation impact value representing a metric for effectiveness of the response value; when the impact value, the response value, and the donation impact value meet one or more predetermined corresponding redirection thresholds, detecting at least one redirection trigger from the disaster information; upon the detection of the at least one redirection trigger: configuring the Internet server hardware system to operate in a redirection mode; receiving or accessing data associated with a transaction between a customer and a merchant by way of: an authorization request for the transaction between the customer and the merchant; an authorization response to the authorization request sent from the card issuer corresponding to the customer to the merchant acquirer corresponding to the merchant; and for each said transaction for which the authorization response includes an indicator that the transaction has been authorized by the card issuer corresponding to the customer; determining, using a neural network of an artificial intelligence engine, from at least one of customer information and merchant information in the data associated with the transaction, a donation amount and a location associated with the transaction; and when the Internet server hardware system is configured to operate in the redirection mode, generating signals to cause accrual of: at least a portion of the donation amount to a redirection account based on the location associated with the transaction; and any remaining portion of the donation amount to one or more defined donation accounts based on charity catchment area parameters; and transmitting a message to a logical address corresponding to a web-enabled mobile computing device associated with the customer indicating that the system is operating in the redirection mode.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the message transmitted to the web-enabled mobile computing device includes an option to increase the amount of the donation.
3. A non-transient computer readable medium comprising software instructions executed by an Internet server hardware system to perform the method as defined in claim 1.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising sending a transmission, to a predetermined logical address, including the accrual of any remaining portion of the donation amount to one or more defined donation accounts based on charity catchment area parameters.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the disaster information includes: at least one redirection region; and a redirection rate for donations arising from transactions occurring within each of the at least one redirection region.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the disaster information includes a redirection time frame, and a redirection goal for the redirection mode.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein when at least one of the redirection time frame ends and the redirection goal is reached, the Internet server hardware system no longer operates in the redirection mode.
8. The method of claim 2, further comprising: receiving a transmission, in response to the message transmitted to the web-enabled mobile computing device, giving instructions to increase the amount of the donation.
9. The method of claim 5, further comprising means for determining at least the portion of the donation amount to accrue to a redirection account based the redirection rate of a redirection region corresponding to the location associated with the transaction.
10. A method comprising: receiving disaster information for a disaster, wherein the disaster information includes a plurality of scores each being selected from the group consisting of: an event impact value representing a relative metric for an extent of the disaster; a response value representing a currency amount to remedy or for a relief effort for the disaster; and a donation impact value representing a metric for effectiveness of the response value; configuring the Internet server hardware system to operate in a redirection mode when the impact value, the response value, and the donation impact value meet one or more predetermined corresponding redirection thresholds; and when the Internet hardware server system is configured in the redirection mode: receiving or accessing data associated with a plurality of transactions, each being conducted between a customer and a merchant by way of: an authorization request for the transaction between the customer and the merchant; an authorization response to the authorization request sent from the card issuer corresponding to the customer to the merchant acquirer corresponding to the merchant; and for each said transaction for which the authorization response includes an indicator that the transaction has been authorized by the card issuer corresponding to the customer; for each said transaction and from the data associated with the transaction: accessing data, using a neural network of an artificial intelligence engine, to calculate a donation amount that the merchant will give for the customer conducting the transaction with merchant, wherein the donation amount is at least in part a percentage of a currency amount of the transaction; determining, from the data associated with the transaction, a location associated with the transaction; generating signals to cause accrual of at least a portion of the donation amount to a redirection account based on the location associated with the transaction; generating signals to cause accrual of any remaining portion of the donation amount to one or more defined donation accounts based on charity catchment area parameters; and calculating, for the plurality of transactions, a summary of each said accrual of any remaining portion of the donation amount to one or more defined donation accounts based on charity catchment area parameters; and transmitting a message to a logical address corresponding to a web-enabled mobile computing device associated with the customer indicating that the system is operating in the redirection mode.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the message transmitted to the web-enabled mobile computing device includes an option to increase the amount of the donation.
12. A non-transient computer readable medium comprising software instructions executed by an Internet server hardware system to perform the method as defined in claim 10.
13. The method of claim 10, further comprising sending a transmission, to a predetermined logical address, including the calculated summary of each said accrual of any remaining portion of the donation amount to one or more defined donation accounts based on charity catchment area parameters.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein the disaster information includes: at least one redirection region, and a redirection rate for donations arising from transactions occurring within each of the at least one redirection region.
15. The method of claim 10, wherein the disaster information includes: a redirection time frame; and a redirection goal for the redirection mode.
16. The method of claim 15, further comprising means, when at least one of the redirection time frame ends and the redirection goal is reached, for configuring the loyalty system to no longer operate in the redirection mode.
17. The method of claim 11, further comprising receiving, in response to the message transmitted to the web-enabled mobile computing device, a transmission giving instructions to increase the amount of the donation.
18. The method of claim 14, further comprising determining at least the portion of the donation amount to accrue to a redirection account based the redirection rate of a redirection region corresponding to the location associated with the transaction.
19. A computer-readable medium or media having stored thereon computer-readable instructions which, when executed by an Internet server hardware system, configure the Internet server hardware system for: receiving disaster information for a disaster, wherein the disaster information includes a plurality of scores each being selected from the group consisting of: an event impact value representing a relative metric for an extent of the disaster; a response value representing a currency amount to remedy or for a relief effort for the disaster; and a donation impact value representing a metric for effectiveness of the response value; configuring the Internet server hardware system to operate in a redirection mode when the impact value, the response value, and the donation impact value meet one or more predetermined corresponding redirection thresholds; and when the Internet hardware server system is configured in the redirection mode: receiving or accessing data associated with a plurality of transactions, each being conducted between a customer and a merchant by way of: an authorization request for the transaction between the customer and the merchant; an authorization response to the authorization request sent from the card issuer corresponding to the customer to the merchant acquirer corresponding to the merchant; and for each said transaction for which the authorization response includes an indicator that the transaction has been authorized by the card issuer corresponding to the customer; for each said transaction and from the data associated with the transaction: accessing data to calculate, using a neural network of an artificial intelligence engine, a donation amount that the merchant will give for the customer conducting the transaction with merchant, wherein the donation amount is at least in part a percentage of a currency amount of the transaction; determining, from the data associated with the transaction, a location associated with the transaction; generating signals to cause accrual of at least a portion of the donation amount to a redirection account based on the location associated with the transaction; transmitting a message to a logical address corresponding to a web-enabled mobile computing device associated with the customer indicating: that the loyalty system is operating in the redirection mode; and an option to increase the amount of the donation; and generating signals to cause accrual of any remaining portion of the donation amount to one or more defined donation accounts based on charity catchment area parameters; calculating, for the plurality of transactions, a summary of each said accrual of any remaining portion of the donation amount to one or more defined donation accounts based on charity catchment area parameters; and transmitting, a logical address, the summary of each said accrual of any remaining portion of the donation amount to one or more defined donation accounts based on charity catchment area parameters.
