<title>
Tilt-Wing Aircraft
</title>

<abstract>
Example embodiment provides an aircraft with improved agility. The aircraft includes a main body, at least two wing assemblies, at least two motors, and a controller. The wing assemblies are attached to the main body. Each motor tilts one wing assembly with a tilting angle. The controller is connected with the motors for controlling the tilting angle of the wing assembly. Each wing assembly further includes a wing, a power plant, and a propeller that is driven by the power plant for providing propulsion. Each wing assembly tilts with an individual tilting angle, so that the aircraft can fly with improved agility. The power plants and propellers on the wings can each be controlled independently in synchronism with the tilting wings.

9. A method for controlling an attitude of an aircraft that comprises a controller and two wing assemblies that are driven by two motors respectively, the method comprising: determining, by the controller, a current flying attitude of the aircraft according to measurements of a plurality of sensors; calculating, by the controller, a first tilting angle of the first wing assembly according to the current flying attitude and a desired flying attitude; calculating, by the controller, a second tilting angle of the second wing assembly according to the current flying attitude and the desired flying attitude; providing, by the first motor, a first torque to the first wing assembly to tilt the first wing assembly with the first tilting angle; providing, by the second motor, a second torque to the second wing assembly to tilt the second wing assembly with the second tilting angle; and controlling the attitude of the aircraft by tilting the first wing assembly with the first tilting angle and tilting the second wing assembly with the second tilting angle simultaneously and respectively.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein each wing assembly further comprises a power plant and a propeller driven by the power plant, the method further comprising: calculating, by the controller, a first power output for the first power plant; calculating, by the controller, a second power output for the second power plant; providing, by the first power plant, the first power output to the first propeller; and providing, by the second power plant, the second power output to the second propeller, wherein the first and second power plant can provide appropriate power in synchronism with the tilting wings to maintain balance of the aircraft according to the control instructions inputted to the system.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising: providing, by the second power plant, a larger power output than the first power plant when the desired flying attitude of the aircraft is shifting to the side of the first wing assembly.
12. The method of claim 9, further comprising: measuring, by the plurality of sensors, parameters of the aircraft, wherein the sensors include one or more of an accelerometer, a gravity sensor, a digital compass, a Global Positioning System (GPS), a temperature sensor, a wind sensor and cameras.
13. The method of claim 9, further comprising: tilting, by the motors, the wing assemblies to be vertical to ground when the desired flying attitude of the aircraft is taking off from the ground, landing on the ground or hovering above the ground.
14. The method of claim 9, further comprising: tilting, by the motors, the wing assemblies with a same forward tilting angle when the desired flying attitude of the aircraft is flying forward or accelerating.
15. The method of claim 9, further comprising: tilting, by the motors, the wing assemblies with a same backward tilting angle when the desired flying attitude of the aircraft is flying backward or decelerating.
16. The method of claim 9, further comprising: tilting, by the motors, the first wing assembly with a forward tilting angle and the second wing assembly with a backward tilting angle when the desired flying attitude of the aircraft is turning towards the side of the second wing assembly.
17. The method of claim 9, further comprising: tilting, by the motors, the first wing assembly upwards and the second wing assembly downwards when the desired flying attitude of the aircraft is rotating around itself.
18. The method of claim 17, further comprising: tilting, by the motors, both wing assemblies downwards when the aircraft has flipped over and is hovering upside down.
