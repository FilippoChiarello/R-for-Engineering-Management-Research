Machine learning device and thermal displacement compensation device
</title>

<abstract>
A calculation formula learning unit sets a coefficient relating to a time lag element in a thermal displacement estimation calculation formula by machine learning while fixing a coefficient relating to measured data except the coefficient relating to the time lag element at a predetermined value based on a difference between a thermal displacement estimated value about a machine element calculated by substituting a measured data group into the thermal displacement estimation calculation formula and a thermal displacement actual measured value about the machine element; sets the coefficient relating to the measured data except the coefficient relating to the time lag element in the thermal displacement estimation calculation formula by machine learning based on the difference while fixing the coefficient relating to the time lag element at a predetermined value; and repeats the machine learning.
