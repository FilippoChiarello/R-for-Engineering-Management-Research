<abstract>
Provided is a technique capable of generating a discriminator having high inference precision at low cost. An inspection system according to one aspect of the present invention generates, from first image data, plural pieces of second image data of a product; determines, by a first discriminator, whether to adopt each piece of the second image data as learning data; generates a learning data set by the second image data that is determined to be adopted as learning data; constructs, by applying machine learning using the generated learning data set, a second discriminator that determines the acceptability of a product; and uses the constructed second discriminator to determine the acceptability of a product in target image data.
