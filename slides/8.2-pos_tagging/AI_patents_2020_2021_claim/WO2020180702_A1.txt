PERSONALIZING PREDICTION OF PERFORMANCE USING DATA AND BODY-POSE FOR ANALYSIS OF SPORTING PERFORMANCE
</title>

<abstract>
A method of generating a player prediction is disclosed herein. A computing system retrieves data from a data store. The computing system generates a predictive model using an artificial neural network. The artificial neural network generates one or more personalized embeddings that include player-specific information based on historical performance. The computing system selects, from the data, one or more features related to each shot attempt captured in the data. The artificial neural network learns an outcome of each shot attempt based at least on the one or more personalized embeddings and the one or more features related to each shot attempt.
