SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR COMPUTING BURNING INDEX SCORE PERTAINING TO CROPS
</title>

<abstract>
Stubble burning is a serious problem resulting in pollution attributable to smog, loss of nutrients in the top soil, and risk of fires spreading out of control. Existing methodologies have attempted to predict burning areas, but have failed to do so because of inefficient sensing mechanism. Present disclosure proposes a system and method to compute burning index score pertaining to crops by detecting harvest season and predicting probable areas of burning by combining current year's crop area map along with harvesting period and historical hot spot information. Computation of the burning index score is accomplished based on inputs received from at least one of satellite imaging, multi - spectral drone based sensing devices and crowdsourcing information. This will help to prioritize the area for taking corrective measures such as training of farmers, availability of resources, optimizing the resources schedule, etc.
