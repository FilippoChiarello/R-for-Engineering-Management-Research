VEHICLE CONTROL DEVICE, VEHICLE MANAGEMENT DEVICE, VEHICLE CONTROL METHOD, AND STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle control device is a vehicle control device mountable in a vehicle and including an acquirer configured to acquire positional information of a frame line of a second parking frame from other vehicle stopped at the second parking frame adjacent to a first parking frame at which the vehicle automatically parks, and a calculator configured to calculate a position of a frame line of the first parking frame on the basis of the positional information of the frame line of the second parking frame acquired by the acquirer.

<claims>
1. A vehicle control device mountable in a vehicle comprising: an acquirer configured to acquire positional information of a frame line of a second parking frame from other vehicle stopped at the second parking frame adjacent to a first parking frame at which the vehicle automatically parks; and a calculator configured to calculate a position of a frame line of the first parking frame on the basis of the positional information of the frame line of the second parking frame acquired by the acquirer.
2. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, further comprising: a first recognizer configured to recognize the frame line of the first parking frame; and a first requester configured to transmit a request for requesting the positional information of the frame line of the second parking frame to the other vehicle in a case where the frame line of the first parking frame is not recognized by the first recognizer.
3. The vehicle control device according to claim 2, wherein the acquirer is configured to acquire the positional information of the frame line of the second parking frame measured by a sensor of the other vehicle activated on the basis of the request.
4. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, further comprising: a second recognizer configured to recognize a position of the other vehicle, wherein the acquirer is configured to acquire information indicating a distance between the other vehicle and the frame line of the second parking frame from the other vehicle, and the calculator is configured to calculate a position of the frame line of the first parking frame on the basis of the position of the other vehicle recognized by the second recognizer and information indicating a distance between the other vehicle and the frame line of the second parking frame, which is acquired by the acquirer.
5. The vehicle control device according to claim 4, wherein the calculator is configured to calculate the position of the frame line of the first parking frame by subtracting the distance between the other vehicle and the frame line of the second parking frame, which is acquired by the acquirer, from a distance between a position of the vehicle and the position of the other vehicle recognized by the second recognizer.
6. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein the acquirer is configured to acquire positional information of the frame line of the first parking frame calculated on the basis of the positional information of the frame line of the second parking frame from the other vehicle.
7. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, further comprising: a second requester configured to transmit a request for requesting an operation of a light illuminating a lower portion of the other vehicle to the other vehicle.
8. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein there is at least another parking frame between the first parking frame and the second parking frame.
9. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, further comprising: a controller configured to control automatic parking of the vehicle at the first parking frame on the basis of the position of the frame line of the first parking frame calculated by the calculator.
10. The vehicle control device according to claim 2, further comprising: a controller configured to control the automatic parking of the vehicle at the first parking frame on the basis of the position of the frame line of the first parking frame calculated by the calculator, wherein the controller is configured to change a parking frame at which the vehicle performs automatic parking in a case where the frame line of the first parking frame is not recognized by the first recognizer and the positional information of the frame line of the second parking frame is not acquired from the other vehicle by the acquirer.
11. The vehicle control device according to claim 2, further comprising: a controller configured to control the automatic parking of the vehicle at the first parking frame on the basis of the position of the frame line of the first parking frame calculated by the calculator, wherein the controller is configured to control the automatic parking to make a center position in a vehicle width direction of the vehicle and a center position in a width direction of the first parking frame overlap each other in a case where the frame line of the first parking frame is not recognized by the first recognizer and the positional information of the frame line of the second parking frame is not acquired from the other vehicle by the acquirer.
12. A vehicle management device that selects a vehicle to be guided to a first parking frame on the basis of positional information of a frame line of a second parking frame transmitted by the vehicle control device according to claim 1.
13. A vehicle control method comprising: by a computer of a vehicle control device mountable in a vehicle, acquiring positional information of a frame line of a second parking frame from other vehicle stopped at the second parking frame adjacent to a first parking frame at which the vehicle automatically parks; and calculating a position of a frame line of the first parking frame on the basis of the acquired positional information of the frame line of the second parking frame.
14. A computer-readable non-transitory storage medium that stores a program causing a computer of a vehicle control device mountable in a vehicle to: acquire positional information of a frame line of a second parking frame from other vehicle stopped at the second parking frame adjacent to a first parking frame at which the vehicle automatically parks, and calculate a position of a frame line of the first parking frame on the basis of the acquired positional information of the frame line of the second parking frame.
