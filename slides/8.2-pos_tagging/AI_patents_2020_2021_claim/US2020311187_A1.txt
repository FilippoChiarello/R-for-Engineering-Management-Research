<title>
System And Method Integrating Machine Learning Algorithms To Enrich Documents In A Content Management System
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for integrating machine learning algorithms to enrich documents in a content management system. The content management system includes a content services engine, a transformation engine to execute one or more transformations on documents stored in the content management system, and a machine learning services to apply a machine learning algorithm to the documents based on the one or more transformations.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A content management system comprising: a content services engine having a content server that stores one or more documents, and is configured to receive a request for a requested document, and serve the requested document to a communication channel; a transformation engine connected with the content services engine via the communication channel, the transformation engine being configured to invoke a transformation to transform the requested document from an original document format to a rendition of the document in an enhanced format; and a machine learning service having one or more machine learning algorithms, the machine learning service being configured to determine one or more algorithm types of the one or more machine learning algorithms based on the transformation invoked by the transformation engine, and to provide the one or more machine learning algorithms to the transformation.
2. The content management system in accordance with claim 1, wherein the machine learning service generates an association for the one or more algorithm types between the original document format and the rendition of the document in the enhanced format
3. The content management system in accordance with claim 2, wherein the machine learning service invokes a policy based on the association.
4. The content management system in accordance with claim 3, wherein an event invokes an action to transform the original document format to the rendition of the document in the enhanced format.
5. The content management system in accordance with claim 1, wherein providing the one or more machine learning algorithms to the transformation includes executing at least one of the one or more machine learning algorithms as part of the transformation.
6. A method executed by a content management system, the method comprising: receiving, by a content server of a content services engine, a request from a user for a requested document from one or more documents stored by the content server; serving, by the content server, the requested document to a transformation engine via a communication channel; invoking, by the transformation engine, a transformation to transform the requested document from an original document format to a rendition of the document in an enhanced format, the transformation including a specification of one or more machine learning algorithms; retrieving, by the transformation engine from a machine learning service, the one or more machine learning algorithms specified by the transformation; and transforming the requested document into the enhanced format using the one or more machine learning algorithms.
7. The method in accordance with claim 6, wherein the machine learning service generates an association for the one or more algorithm types between the original document format and the rendition of the document in the enhanced format
8. The method in accordance with claim 7, wherein the machine learning service invokes a policy based on the association.
9. The method in accordance with claim 8, wherein an event invokes an action to transform the original document format to the rendition of the document in the enhanced format.
10. The method in accordance with claim 1, wherein providing the one or more machine learning algorithms to the transformation includes executing at least one of the one or more machine learning algorithms as part of the transformation.
