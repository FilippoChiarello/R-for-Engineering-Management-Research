INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
An information processing system is configured to generate data for identifying an emotion of a person touching a deformable structure (11). The information processing system includes a sensor provided in the structure (11) and configured to output a signal indicating a temporal change of a physical quantity in the structure (11) due to a touch by the person; and an electronic control unit (30) configured to i) perform fast Fourier transform on the signal at a sampling frequency that is equal to or less than 10 Hz to generate frequency domain data, ii) quantize data with a frequency equal to or less than half the sampling frequency among the frequency domain data into a predetermined number of frequency bands to generate emotion identification data, and iii) perform machine learning using the emotion identification data as input data, to generate classification boundary data for classifying data serving as a processing target according to emotion categories.
