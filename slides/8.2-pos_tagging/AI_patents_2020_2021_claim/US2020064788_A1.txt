<title>
METHOD AND CONTROL DEVICE FOR CONTROLLING A TECHNICAL SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
In order to control a technical system, a system state of the technical system is continually detected. By a trained first control model, a subsequent state of the technical system is predicted on the basis of a sensed system state. Then, a distance value is determined for a distance between the predicted subsequent state and an actually occurring system state. Furthermore, a second control model is trained by the trained first control model to predict the distance value on the basis of a sensed system state and on the basis of a control action for controlling the technical system. A subsequent state predicted by the first control model is then modified on the basis of a distance value predicted by the trained second control model. The modified subsequent state is output in order to control the technical system.

<claims>
1. A method for controlling a technical system, wherein a) a system state of the technical system is continually detected, b) by a trained first control model, a subsequent state of the technical system is predicted on the basis of a detected system state, c) a distance value is determined for a distance between the predicted subsequent state and an actually occurring system state, d) a second control model is trained by the trained first control model to predict the distance value on the basis of a detected system state, and on the basis of a control action for controlling the technical system, e) a subsequent state predicted by the first control model is modified on the basis of a distance value predicted by the trained second control model, and f) the modified subsequent state is generated as an output for the control of the technical system.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least one of the first and the second control model comprises a neural network, a Gaussian process, a support vector machine, a data-driven trainable regression model, a physical model and/or a decision tree.
3. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the system state incorporates an influencing variable, the influence of which upon the technical system dominates an influence of the control action upon the technical system.
4. The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the technical system is a wind turbine, and the influencing variable comprises a wind speed, a turbine capacity, a speed of rotation and/or an acceleration of the generating gear nacelle.
5. The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the influencing variable is subject to statistical fluctuations, and in that the first control model is trained to optimize a statistical mean of a distance between the predicted subsequent state and an actually occurring system state.
6. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first control model is trained on the basis of detected system states of the technical system.
7. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first control model is trained on the basis of detected system states of a training system which differs from the technical system.
8. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least one of in the training of the first control model and in the prediction of the subsequent state, the control action is not considered.
9. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein for a plurality of control actions, a respective distance value is predicted by the trained second control model, and a predicted subsequent state is thus modified and assigned to the respective control action, in that, from the resulting modified subsequent states, a target state is selected, and in that the technical system is controlled on the basis of the control action which is assigned to the selected target state.
10. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein a third control model, by the trained first control model and the trained second control model is trained, on the basis of a detected system state, to generate the output of an optimum control action for the control of the technical system.
11. The method as claimed in claim 10, wherein the third control model is trained by a reinforcement learning method.
12. A control device for the control of a technical system, which is designed to execute a method as claimed in claim 1.
13. A computer program product, comprising a computer readable hardware storage device having computer readable program code stored therein, said program code executable by a processor of a computer system to implement a method which is designed to execute a method as claimed in claim 1.
14. A computer-readable storage medium containing a computer program product as claimed in claim 13.
