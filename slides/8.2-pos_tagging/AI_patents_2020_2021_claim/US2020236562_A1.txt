<title>
NODE PROFILING BASED ON A KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR (KPI)
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a system for profiling one or more nodes based on a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) associated to a node. Initially, a receiving module receives a flag indicating an issue with the KPI of a node present in a network of nodes. An identification module identifies a set of Performance Management (PM) counters influencing the KPI using machine learning based statistical method of correlation. A determination module determines a subset of PM counters, from the set of PM counters, by comparing each PM counter with a corresponding predefined threshold limit. A normalization module normalizes the subset of PM counters by computing a variance of the subset of PM counters. A profile module profiles one or more nodes, present in the network of nodes, by comparing the variance associated to the node with variance corresponding to each of the one or more nodes.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A system for profiling one or more nodes based on a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) associated to a node in a communication network, the system comprising: a memory; a processor coupled to the memory, wherein the processor is configured to execute programmed instructions stored in the memory for: receiving a flag indicating an issue with a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) of a node present in a network of nodes; identifying a set of Performance Management (PM) counters influencing the KPI, wherein the set of PM counters is identified using machine learning based statistical method of correlation; determining a subset of PM counters, from the set of PM counters, by comparing each PM counter with a corresponding predefined threshold limit; normalizing the subset of PM counters by computing a variance of the subset of PM counters; and profiling one or more nodes, present in the network of nodes, by comparing the variance associated to the node with a variance corresponding to each of the one or more nodes.
2. The system of claim 1 further comprises installing a patch at the node to resolve the flag, wherein the patch is installed based on the variance in the subset of PM counters.
