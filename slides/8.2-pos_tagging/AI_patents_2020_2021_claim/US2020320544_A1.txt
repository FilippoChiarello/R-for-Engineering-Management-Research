<title>
INTELLIGENT TOE CAP
</title>

<abstract>
System and methods for managing compliance of a wearer of apparel are disclosed. One method includes receiving an identifier associated with a toe cap for footwear; receiving, via radio frequency, characteristic information associated with the toe cap for footwear; determining a compliance of the toe cap based at least on the identifier and the characteristic information; and providing a response to a wearer of the footwear based at least upon the determination of the compliance.
</abstract>

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for managing compliance of apparel, the method comprising: receiving an identifier associated with a toe cap for footwear; receiving, via radio frequency, characteristic information associated with the toe cap for footwear; determining a compliance of the toe cap based at least on the identifier and the characteristic information; and providing a response to a wearer of the footwear based at least upon the determination of the compliance.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the identifier is received via radio frequency from an RFID tag disposed in the footwear.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the identifier is received via a wireless communication channel.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the characteristic information is represented by an RF signal form generated from an antenna disposed in the footwear.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein a compromised condition of the toe cap is reflected in the signal form generated from the antenna.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the compliance comprises comparing the characteristic information to comparative information.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the comparative information is selected based at least on the identifier.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the response to the wearer comprises one or more of audio feedback, visual feedback, and tactile feedback.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the response to the wearer indicates a notification to the wearer of the compliance, instructions to the wearer, a suggestion to alter the footwear, or a combination thereof.
10. A compliance management system comprising: a memory comprising one or more compliance rules and processor executable instructions; a processor in communication with the memory, the processor configured to: receive an identifier associated with a toe cap for footwear; receive, via radio frequency, characteristic information associated with the toe cap for footwear; determine a compliance of the toe cap based at least on the identifier and the characteristic information; and provide a response to a wearer of the footwear based at least upon the determination of the compliance.
11. The compliance management system of claim 10, wherein the identifier is received via radio frequency from an RFID tag disposed in the footwear.
12. The compliance management system of claim 10, wherein the identifier is received via a wireless communication channel.
13. The compliance management system of claim 10, wherein the characteristic information is represented by an RF signal form generated from an antenna disposed in the footwear.
14. The compliance management system of claim 13, wherein a compromised condition of the toe cap is reflected in the signal form generated from the antenna.
15. The compliance management system of claim 10, wherein determining the compliance comprises comparing the characteristic information to comparative information.
16. The compliance management system of claim 15, wherein the comparative information is selected based at least on the identifier.
17. The compliance management system of claim 10, wherein the response to the wearer comprises one or more of audio feedback, visual feedback, and tactile feedback.
18. The compliance management system of claim 10, wherein the response to the wearer indicates a notification to the wearer of the compliance, instructions to the wearer, a suggestion to alter the footwear, or a combination thereof.
19. The compliance management system of claim 10, wherein the compliance rule indicates a safety compliance for the toe cap.
20. The compliance management system of claim 10, wherein the compliance rule indicates a compromised state threshold for the toe cap.
