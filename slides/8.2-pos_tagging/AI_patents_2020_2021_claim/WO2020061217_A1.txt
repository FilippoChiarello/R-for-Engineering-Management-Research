ASSESSING HOST RNA USING ISOTHERMAL AMPLIFICATION AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE
</title>

<abstract>
A method for estimating a diagnostic score includes adding a first aliquot of a test sample to a first reaction vessel, and a second aliquot of the test sample to a second reaction vessel. The test sample includes a first target nucleic acid and a second target nucleic acid. The second target nucleic acid has a lower expected abundance than the first target nucleic acid. The second aliquot has a larger volume than the first aliquot. A first relative abundance value of the first target nucleic acid and a second relative abundance value of the second target nucleic acid are estimated by performing a first real-time quantitative isothermal amplification assay in the first reaction vessel, and performing a second real-time quantitative isothermal amplification assay in the second reaction vessel, respectively. The diagnostic score is estimated based on the first relative abundance value and the second relative abundance value.
