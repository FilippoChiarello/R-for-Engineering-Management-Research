METHOD TO LABEL SUBSTRATES BASED ON PROCESS PARAMETERS
</title>

<abstract>
Substrates to be processed are partitioned based on pre-processing data that is associated with substrates before a process step. The data is partitioned using a partition rule and the substrates are partitioned into subsets in accordance with subsets of the data obtained by the partitioning. Corrections are applied, specific to each subset. The partition rule is obtained using decision tree analysis on a training set of substrates. The decision tree analysis uses pre-processing data associated with the training substrates before they were processed, and post-processing data associated with the training substrates after being subject to the process step. The partition rule that defines the decision tree is selected from a plurality of partition rules based on a characteristic of subsets of the post-processing data. The associated corrections are obtained implicitly at the same time.
