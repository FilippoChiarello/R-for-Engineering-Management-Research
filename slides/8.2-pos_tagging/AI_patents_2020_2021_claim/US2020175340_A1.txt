METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR EVALUATING QUALITY OF MEDICAL IMAGE DATASET FOR MACHINE LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to a method for evaluating quality of a medical image dataset and a system thereof capable of confirming whether medical image data is suitable to be used for machine learning. Evaluation items may include data normality which means a ratio of normal frames in all frames; learning fitness which means a ratio of labeled or labelable frames in the received data; and anatomical completeness which means a ratio of anatomical elements included in the received data against anatomical elements based on medical standards.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for evaluating quality of a medical image dataset for machine learning using a system including a requirement definition unit, a data reception unit, and a data evaluation unit, the method comprising: receiving, by the requirement definition unit, requirements according to a machine learning purpose; receiving, by the data reception unit, medical image data for machine learning; and evaluating, by the data evaluation unit, evaluation items in which the requirement received by the requirement definition unit is applied to the medical image data for machine learning received by the data reception unit, wherein the evaluation items include data normality which means a ratio of normal frames in all frames; learning fitness which means a ratio of labeled or labelable frames in the received data; and anatomical completeness which means a ratio of anatomical elements included in the received data against anatomical elements based on medical standards.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the data normality is calculated by the following Equation 1. (Here, T represents the total number of frames, Nor represents the number of normal frames, Ni represents the number of i-th type obstacle frames, and i represents an index of the obstacle type.)
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the learning fitness is calculated by the following Equation 2. (Here, T means the total number of frames and L means the number of labeled or labelable frames.)
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the anatomical completeness is calculated by the following Equation 3. (Here, MF is the number of required features found, TMF is the total number of required features, OF is the number of optional features found, TOF is the total number of optional features, and Î± means a ratio factor determined according to the learning purpose.)
5. The method of claim 1, wherein in the receiving of the requirements according to the machine learning purpose, the requirement definition unit determines obstacle data defined according to a machine learning purpose, and in the evaluating of the evaluation items, data from which the obstacle data is removed is evaluated.
6. A system for evaluating quality of a medical image dataset for machine learning, the system comprising: a requirement definition unit configured to receive requirements according to a machine learning purpose; a data reception unit configured to receive medical image data for machine learning; and a data evaluation unit configured to evaluate evaluation items in which the requirement received by the requirement definition unit is applied to the medical image data for machine learning received by the data reception unit, wherein the data evaluation unit includes, as evaluation items, data normality which means a ratio of normal frames in all frames; learning fitness which means a ratio of labeled or labelable frames in the received data; and anatomical completeness which means a ratio of anatomical elements included in the received data against anatomical elements based on medical standards.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the data normality is calculated by the following Equation 1. (Here, T represents the total number of frames, Nor represents the number of normal frames, Ni represents the number of i-th type obstacle frames, and i represents an index of the obstacle type.)
8. The system of claim 6, wherein the learning fitness is calculated by the following Equation 2. (Here, T means the total number of frames and L means the number of labeled or labelable frames.)
9. The system of claim 6, wherein the anatomical completeness is calculated by the following Equation 3. (Here, MF is the number of required features found, TMF is the total number of required features, OF is the number of optional features found, TOF is the total number of optional features, ands means a ratio factor determined according to the learning purpose.)
10. The system of claim 6, wherein the requirement definition unit determines obstacle data defined according to a machine learning purpose, and the data evaluation unit evaluates data from which the obstacle data is removed.
