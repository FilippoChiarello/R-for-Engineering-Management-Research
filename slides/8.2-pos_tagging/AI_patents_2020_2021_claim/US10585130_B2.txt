<title>
Noise spectrum analysis for electronic device
</title>

<abstract>
A method for analyzing noise spectrum of an electronic device includes storing a waveform data including a plurality of data points, the waveform data is obtained by measuring a target signal from the electronic device, removing data points corresponding to a background noise fluctuation based on a smooth curve of the waveform data, data points considered candidates for peaks are extracted from the waveform data, classifying the extracted data points based on a distance between adjacent data points in order to discriminate a cluster of distant data points from data points closely positioned to dominant peaks, determining the dominant peaks based on the cluster of distant data points such that the data points closely positioned to the dominant peaks are ignored, each dominant peak corresponds to the characteristic of the electronic device, and outputting the dominant peaks as an analysis result for the electronic device.

1. A computer program product for analyzing noise spectrum of an electronic device comprising: a non-transitory computer readable storage medium containing computer instructions stored therein for causing a computer processor to perform the steps of: storing, in a memory device, a waveform data including a plurality of data points, wherein the waveform data is obtained by measuring a target signal from the electronic device; removing data points, from the plurality of data points in the waveform data, corresponding to a background noise fluctuation based on a smooth curve of the waveform data, such that the data points are extracted from the waveform data, wherein the extracted data points comprise candidates for peaks in the waveform data; estimating one or more optimal parameters by maximizing a count of remaining data points after removal with respect to a smoothing parameter, wherein removing the data points from the plurality of data points in the waveform data is repeated with each optimal parameter in the one or more optimal parameters until a second order derivative of the count of remaining data points after a subsequent removal becomes negative, wherein the data points representing the candidates for peaks are extracted as remaining data points after a final removal; classifying the extracted data points based on a distance between adjacent data points in order to discriminate a cluster of distant data points from data points closely positioned to one or more dominant peaks, each distant data point in the cluster of distant data points defining a region in the waveform data associated to a characteristic of the electronic device; determining the one or more dominant peaks based on the cluster of distant data points such that the data points closely positioned to the determined one or more dominant peaks are ignored, wherein each dominant peak corresponds to the characteristic of the electronic device; and outputting the one or more dominant peaks as an analysis result for the electronic device.
2. The computer program product of claim 1, wherein removing the data points, from the plurality of data points in the waveform data, corresponding to the background noise fluctuation comprises: calculating the smooth curve of the waveform data such that a fit to remaining data points is obtained after a previous removal; and selecting data points to be removed from the remaining data points based on an amplitude of each remaining data point relative to the smooth curve.
3. The computer program product of claim 2, wherein removing data points, from the plurality of data points in the waveform data, corresponding to the background noise fluctuation comprises: repeatedly removing the data points with each optimal parameter until a number of iterations reaches a specified number of times, the data points representing the candidates for peak being extracted as remaining data points after the final removal.
4. The computer program product of claim 1, wherein the distance between adjacent data points corresponds to an interval between the adjacent data points in the extracted data points with respect to an independent variable of the waveform data.
5. The computer program product of claim 1, wherein classifying the extracted data points based on the distance between adjacent data points comprises: performing a clustering analysis on a plurality of random seeds; and selecting a combination of clusters based on a separation between the cluster of the distant data points and another cluster comprising the data points closely positioned to the one or more dominant peaks and a number of members in the another cluster for each random seed if a plurality of different combinations is obtained by the clustering analysis, the separation being defined as a separation between a minimum value of the distance in the cluster and a maximum value of the distance in the another cluster.
6. The computer program product of claim 1, wherein classifying the extracted data points based on the distance between adjacent data points comprises: dividing the extracted data points into a first cluster having a larger distance and a second cluster having a shorter distance; determining whether a further division is required; and in response to determining that the further division is required, dividing data points of the second cluster into a third cluster having a larger distance and a fourth cluster having a shorter distance; and merging the first cluster and the third cluster as the cluster of the distant data points.
7. The computer program product of claim 1, wherein determining the one or more dominant peaks comprises: setting boundaries between adjacent distant data points in the cluster of distant data points to define the region in the waveform data associated to the characteristic of the electronic device; and detecting an extreme from the waveform data within each region defined by adjacent boundaries.
8. The computer program product of claim 1, wherein the smooth curve is based on a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing technique and classifying the extracted data points is based on a k-means clustering analysis.
9. The computer program product of claim 1, wherein each data point comprises an independent variable and a dependent variable, the independent variable being either frequency or time, the dependent variable being a magnitude of an electromagnetic interference signal emitted from the electronic device with respect to the independent variable, the electronic device including a plurality of noise sources with different base frequencies.
