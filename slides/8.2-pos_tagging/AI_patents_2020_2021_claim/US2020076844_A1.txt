SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PROVIDING SECURE REMOTE DATA TRANSFER FOR MEDICAL DEVICES
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems are provided for providing a secure connection to a medical device for remote servicing of the medical device. In one embodiment, a computing device is in communication with a medical device, the computing device comprising non-transitory memory including executable instructions for: communicating with the medical device via a first protocol; and communicating with a remote computing device via an encrypted, second protocol. The computing device also includes a processor for executing said executable instructions.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computing device in communication with a medical device, the computing device comprising: non-transitory memory including executable instructions for: communicating with the medical device via a first protocol; and communicating with a remote computing device via an encrypted, second protocol; and a processor for executing said executable instructions.
2. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the non-transitory memory further includes executable instructions for determining firewall screening rules.
3. The computing device of claim 2, wherein the firewall screening rules comprise rules for categorizing incoming traffic as either verified or unverified traffic.
4. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the non-transitory memory further includes executable instructions for blocking unverified traffic.
5. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the non-transitory memory further includes executable instructions for permitting verified traffic to pass through the computing device.
6. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the non-transitory memory further includes executable instructions for identifying the first protocol from a list of protocols.
7. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the computing device is in communication with the medical device via a wired connection, and wherein the computing device is included between the medical device and a hospital network.
8. A method for servicing a medical device, comprising: encrypting a connection between a remote computing device and a supplemental computing device for a medical device; and converting between a first protocol used by the medical device and a second protocol used by the remote computing device to enable communication between the remote computing device and the medical device.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising identifying the first protocol from a list of protocols.
10. The method of claim 8, further comprising blocking unverified traffic, the unverified traffic determined based on a set of screening rules.
11. The method of claim 8, further comprising periodically querying the remote computing device to log into the medical device for servicing of the medical device.
12. A system, comprising: a medical device; a remote computing device configured with executable instructions stored in non-transitory memory for servicing the medical device; and a supplemental computing device communicatively coupled to the medical device and configured with executable instructions stored in non-transitory memory that when executed cause the computing device to: identify a first protocol used by the medical device; convert between the first protocol used by the medical device a second protocol used by the remote computing device; and encrypt communications with the remote computing device via a security protocol.
13. The system of claim 12, further comprising a hospital network, wherein the supplemental computing device and the medical device are included on the hospital network.
14. The system of claim 13, further comprising one or more external databases, the external databases included on the hospital network and in communication with the medical device and the supplemental computing device.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the external databases include one or more of a picture archiving and communication system (PACS), hospital information system (HIS), a radiology information system (RIS), and an electronic medical record (EMR) system.
16. The system of claim 14, wherein the supplemental computing device comprises a firewall that blocks unverified traffic between the medical device and the hospital network and secures open ports on the medical device.
17. The system of claim 14, wherein the supplemental computing device does not block data from the one or more external databases.
18. The system of claim 13, wherein the supplemental computing device is an aftermarket device and is included between the medical device and the hospital network.
19. The system of claim 13, wherein the supplemental computing device is configured with additional executable instructions stored in non-transitory memory that when executed cause the computing device to identify one or more protocols used to communicate on the hospital network.
20. The system of claim 12, wherein the supplemental computing device is configured with additional executable instructions stored in non-transitory memory that when executed cause the computing device to identify itself to the remote computing device and periodically send a login request query to the remote computing device.
