<title>
Artificial intelligence to enhance a listening experience
</title>

<abstract>
An earbud system and method adaptively acquires and classifies one or more data sets to provide a custom audio listening experience.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A music listening customization system, comprising: a data input module comprising a computing device and computer-readable instructions that, when executed, cause the data input module to: receive customization data that includes at least one of equalization data from a sound test by a user and music preference data of the user; and provide the customization data to a customization rule module; wherein: the customization rule module comprises a computing device and computer readable instructions that, when executed, cause the customization rule module to: apply an artificial intelligence algorithm to the customization data to generate a customization rule set based on the customization data, the customization rule set comprising rules that, when applied to music, change at least one of a pitch, frequency, timbre, decibels, equalizer, and other audible musical characteristic to enhance music that is played for the user, wherein the customization data comprises a song set comprising at least one song, applying the artificial intelligence algorithm comprises mapping a note from the at least one song to a plurality of measurable tonal qualities, and the customization rule set is based at least in part on the plurality of measurable tonal qualities.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the customization data further comprises at least one of the following: user-defined preferences; user listening patterns; data sources; external information; real-time auto-populated data; parental control settings; a physiological response of a user; and doctor prescribed settings.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the customization rule set comprises at least one customization rule.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein: the customization data comprises a user tone map; the user tone map comprises a tone deficiency; and the customization rule set comprises a rule to compensate for the tone deficiency by amplifying an associated tone.
5. The system of claim 3, wherein: the customization data comprises a song set comprising at least one song; applying the artificial intelligence algorithm comprises determining at least one sound characteristic of the song set; and the customization rule set is based at least in part on the at least one sound characteristic.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein: the song set comprises at least two songs; and all songs in the song set share a common genre.
7. A computer-implemented method for customizing musical output, comprising: receiving customization data that includes equalization testing data of a user; applying an artificial intelligence algorithm to the customization data to generate a customization rule set based on the customization data; and using the customization rule to compensate for hearing deficiencies of the user by changing at least one of a pitch, frequency, timbre, and other audible musical characteristic associated with music that is played for the user, wherein the customization data comprises a song set comprising at least one song, applying the artificial intelligence algorithm comprises mapping a note from the at least one song to a plurality of measurable tonal qualities, and the customization rule set is based at least in part on the plurality of measurable tonal qualities.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the customization data comprises at least one of: a user's physiological response metrics; ambient sound; ambient light; currently played music; a user's active choice; and a user's active response.
9. The method of claim 7, further comprising applying the customization rule set to base audio to generate customized audio.
10. The method of claim 7, wherein the active choice of a user includes conscious music selections and in-time conscious responses.
11. The method of claim 7, wherein the active choice of a user includes music genre choice and volume control from played music.
12. The method of claim 7, wherein the active response of a user includes one or more volume adjustment or and setting adjustment.
13. The method of claim 7, wherein the active choice of a user includes one or more of: a selected musical piece; a selected music playlist; a modified frequency profile; a modified tone profile; a modified volume profile; modified or deleted language content of a musical piece; and selected output from control to another app.
14. The method of claim 7, wherein the modified or deleted language content comprises deletion of vulgarity or a translation.
15. The method of claim 7, further comprising using the customization rule for left-right balance, compression, noise cancellation, and volume control based on external information.
16. A music listening customization system, comprising: a data input module comprising a computing device and computer-readable instructions that, when executed, cause the data input module to: receive customization data that includes music preference data based on at least one user-defined preference, collected data of the user, and an external data source; and provide the customization data to a customization rule module; wherein: the customization rule module comprises a computing device and computer readable instructions that, when executed, cause the customization rule module to: apply an artificial intelligence algorithm to the customization data to generate a customization rule set based on the customization data, the customization rule comprising rules that, when applied to music, change at least one of a pitch, frequency, timbre, decibels, equalizer, and other musical characteristic to enhance music that is played for the user, the customization data comprising a song set comprising at least one song, applying the artificial intelligence algorithm comprises mapping a note from the at least one song to a plurality of measurable tonal qualities, and the customization rule set is based at least in part on the plurality of measurable tonal qualities.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein the collected data includes at least one of previous user control, preferred music type, volume control, and listening habits.
18. The system of claim 16, wherein: the external data source includes at least one of a listening pattern, music playlist, top chart songs, ranked songs, songs by genre, song data analytics, song characteristics, requested equalization settings, and standard equalization settings; and the customization rule set comprises a rule to modify music to have a musical characteristic associated from the external data source.
