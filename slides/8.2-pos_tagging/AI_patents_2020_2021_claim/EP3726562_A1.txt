AMBIENT IONIZATION MASS SPECTROMETRY IMAGING PLATFORM FOR DIRECT MAPPING FROM BULK TISSUE
</title>

<abstract>
A method of ion imaging is disclosed that includes automatically sampling a plurality of different locations on a sample 20 using a first device 21 which is arranged and adapted to generate aerosol, smoke or vapour from the sample 20. Mass spectral data and/or ion mobility data corresponding to each location is obtained and the obtained mass spectral data and/or ion mobility data is used to construct, train or improve a sample classification model.

<claims>
1. A mass spectrometer and/or ion mobility spectrometer comprising: a first device comprising an a laser device arranged and adapted to generate aerosol, smoke or vapour from a sample; a device arranged and adapted to automatically translate said sample relative to said first device any one or more of before, during, and after obtaining mass spectral data and/or ion mobility data from at least some of said locations on said sample; a collision surface located within a vacuum chamber of said mass spectrometer and/or ion mobility spectrometer; a device arranged and adapted to add a matrix to said aerosol, smoke or vapour prior to said aerosol, smoke or vapour impacting upon said collision surface; and a control system arranged and adapted: (i) to automatically sample a plurality of different locations on said sample using said first device and to obtain mass spectral data and/or ion mobility data corresponding to each said location; and (ii) to use said obtained mass spectral data and/or ion mobility data to construct, train or improve a sample classification model;
wherein in use at least some of said aerosol, smoke or vapour and matrix is caused to impact upon said collision wherein at least some of said aerosol, smoke or vapour is ionized upon impacting said collision surface so as to generate analyte ions; and
wherein said matrix is selected from the group consisting of: (i) a solvent for said aerosol, smoke or vapour; (ii) an organic solvent; (iii) a volatile compound; (iv) polar molecules; (v) water; (vi) one or more alcohols; (vii) methanol; (viii) ethanol; (ix) isopropanol; (x) acetone; (xi) acetonitrile; (xii) 1-butanol; (xiii) tetrahydrofuran; (xiv) ethyl acetate; (xv) ethylene glycol; (xvi) dimethyl sulfoxide; (xvii) an aldehyde; (xviii) a ketone; (xiv) non-polar molecules; (xx) hexane; (xxi) chloroform; (xxii) butanol; and (xxiii) propanol or wherein said matrix comprises a lockmass or calibration compound.
2. A mass spectrometer and/or ion mobility spectrometer as claimed in claim 1, wherein said sample comprises a biological sample, biological tissue, human tissue, animal tissue, biological matter, a bacterial colony, a fungal colony or one or more bacterial strains.
3. A mass spectrometer and/or ion mobility spectrometer as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said sample comprises native or unmodified sample material, optionally wherein said native or unmodified sample material is unmodified by the addition of a matrix or reagent.
4. A mass spectrometer and/or ion mobility spectrometer as claimed in any of claims 1, 2 or 3, wherein said sample classification model comprises a biological sample classification model, a biological tissue classification model, a human tissue classification model, an animal tissue classification model or a bacterial strain classification model.
5. A mass spectrometer and/or ion mobility spectrometer as claimed in any preceding claim, further comprising a heater which is arranged and adapted to heat said collision surface.
6. A mass spectrometer and/or ion mobility spectrometer as claimed in claim 5, wherein said heater is arranged and adapted to heat said collision surface to a temperature selected from the group consisting of: (i) 200-300 °C; (ii) 300-400 °C; (iii) 400-500 °C; (iv) 500-600 °C; (v) 600-700 °C; (vi) 700-800 °C; (vii) 800-900 °C; (viii) 900-1000 °C; (ix) 1000-1100 °C; and (x) > 1100 °C
