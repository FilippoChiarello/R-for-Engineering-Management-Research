CROWD SENSING FOR ELEVATOR SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
An aspect includes capturing crowd data associated with a lobby area of an elevator system. A dispatching schedule of one or more elevator cars of the elevator system is adjusted based on the crowd data. A notification of the adjustment to the dispatching schedule is output.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising: capturing crowd data associated with a lobby area of an elevator system; adjusting a dispatching schedule of one or more elevator cars of the elevator system based on the crowd data; and outputting a notification of the adjustment to the dispatching schedule.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the crowd data is captured by a sensing system.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein adjusting the dispatching schedule is selectively enabled on-demand in response to an enable command.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein adjusting the dispatching schedule is selectively enabled based on one or more of a predetermined schedule and an artificial intelligence algorithm configured to predict formation of a crowd.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein adjusting the dispatching schedule is selectively enabled based on verification of an active subscription to a crowd control service.
6. The method of claim 1 further comprising: providing a priority request to schedule an empty elevator car targeting a selected user; and adjusting the dispatching schedule to incorporate the priority request.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein the notification of the adjustment to the dispatching schedule comprises a message transmitted to one or more mobile devices associated with one or more targeted users.
8. The method of claim 1 further comprising: determining a travel impact on a user based on the crowd data; and outputting a notification of a travel plan adjustment for the user based on the travel plan.
9. The method of claim 8 wherein the travel impact comprises an estimated delay for crowd reduction at the lobby area, and the notification of the travel plan adjustment comprises a message indicating that a subsequent notification will be sent based on a crowd size reduction dropping below a predetermined threshold.
10. The method of claim 8 wherein the notification of the travel plan adjustment comprises an identification of a priority elevator car dispatched for the user.
11. A system comprising: a sensing system configured to capture crowd data associated with a lobby area of an elevator system; and a dispatching system configured to adjust a dispatching schedule of one or more elevator cars of the elevator system based on the crowd data and output a notification of the adjustment to the dispatching schedule.
12. The system of claim 11 wherein adjustment of the dispatching schedule is selectively enabled on-demand in response to an enable command.
13. The system of claim 11 wherein adjustment of the dispatching schedule is selectively enabled based on one or more of a predetermined schedule and an artificial intelligence algorithm configured to predict formation of a crowd.
14. The system of claim 11 wherein adjustment of the dispatching schedule is selectively enabled based on verification of an active subscription to a crowd control service.
15. The system of claim 11 wherein the dispatching system is configured to provide a priority request to schedule an empty elevator car targeting a selected user and adjust the dispatching schedule to incorporate the priority request.
16. The system of claim 11 wherein the notification of the adjustment to the dispatching schedule comprises a message transmitted to one or more mobile devices associated with one or more targeted users.
17. The system of claim 11 wherein the dispatching system is configured to determine a travel impact on a user based on the crowd data and output a notification of a travel plan adjustment for the user based on the travel plan.
18. The system of claim 17 wherein the travel impact comprises an estimated delay for crowd reduction at the lobby area, and the notification of the travel plan adjustment comprises a message indicating that a subsequent notification will be sent based on a crowd size reduction dropping below a predetermined threshold.
19. The system of claim 17 wherein the notification of the travel plan adjustment comprises an identification of a priority elevator car dispatched for the user.
20. A method comprising: capturing crowd data associated with a lobby area of an elevator system; determining a travel impact for a user based on the crowd data; and outputting a notification of a travel plan adjustment for the user based on the travel impact.
