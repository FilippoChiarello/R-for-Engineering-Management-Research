METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATMENT OF PANCREATIC CANCER
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention provides various compositions and methods useful for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PD AC), and methods for activating pancreatic tissue-specific anti-tumor T cell immunity. In some embodiments such methods involve administration of IL33. In some embodiments such methods involve administration of a PD-1 and/or PD-L1 inhibitor.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method of treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PD AC) in a subject in need thereof, the method comprising administering to a subject with PD AC an effective amount of IL33, thereby treating the PD AC in the subject.
2. A method of treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PD AC) in a subject in need thereof, the method comprising administering to a subject with PD AC an effective amount of: (a) IL33 and (b) a PD-1 and/or PD-L1 inhibitor, thereby treating the PD AC in the subject.
3. A method of activating pancreatic tissue-specific anti -tumor T cell immunity in a subject in need thereof, the method comprising administering to a subject with PD AC an effective amount of IL33, thereby activating pancreatic tissue-specific anti-tumor T cell immunity in the subject.
4. A method of activating pancreatic tissue-specific anti-tumor T cell immunity in a subject in need thereof, the method comprising administering to a subject with PD AC an effective amount of: (a) IL33 and (b) a PD-1 and/or PD-L1 inhibitor, thereby activating pancreatic tissue-specific anti -tumor T cell immunity in the subject.
5. A method of activating pancreatic ILC2 cells, the method comprising contacting pancreatic ILC2 cells with an effective amount of IL33, thereby activating the pancreatic ILC2 cells.
6. A method of activating pancreatic ILC2 cells, the method comprising contacting pancreatic ILC2 cells with an effective amount of: (a) IL33 and (b) a PD-1 and/or PD-L1 inhibitor, thereby activating the pancreatic ILC2 cells.
7. A method according to claim 5 or claim 6, wherein the ILC2 cells are contacted with the IL33, PD-1 inhibitor or PD-L1 inhibitor in vitro / ex vivo.
8. A method according to claim 5 or claim 6, wherein the ILC2 cells are contacted with the IL33, PD-1 inhibitor or PD-L1 inhibitor in vivo.
9. A method of sensitizing PD AC tumors and/or pancreatic ILC2 cells to PD-1 and/or PD-L1 inhibitors, the method comprising contacting PDAC tumors and/or pancreatic ILC2 cells with an effective amount of IL33, thereby sensitizing the PDAC tumors and/or pancreatic ILC2 cells to PD-1 and/or PD-L1 inhibitors.
10. A method according to any of claims 1-4, wherein the subject is a human.
11. A method according to any of claims 1-4, wherein the subject is a non-human mammal.
12. A method according to any of claims 1-4, wherein the subject is a mouse.
13. A method according to any of claims 1-4, wherein the subject has a PDAC that is partially or totally resistant to PD-1 and/or PD-L1 inhibitor treatment.
14. A method according to any of claims 1-9, wherein the IL33 is recombinant IL33.
15. A method according to claim 10, wherein the IL33 is human IL33.
16. A method according to claim 10, wherein the IL33 is recombinant human IL33.
17. A method according to claim 12, wherein the IL33 is mouse IL33.
18. A method according to claim 12, wherein the IL33 is recombinant mouse IL33.
19. A method according to any of claims 2, 4, 6, and 9, wherein the PD-1 inhibitor is an antibody.
20. A method according to any of claims 2, 4, 6, and 9, wherein the PD-1 inhibitor is selected from the group consisting of pembrolizumab, nivolumab, cemiplimab, AMP-224, AMP-514 and PDR001.
21. A method according to any of claims 2, 4, 6, and 9, wherein the PD-L1 inhibitor is an antibody.
22. A method according to any of claims 2, 4, 6, and 9, wherein the PD-L1 inhibitor is selected from the group consisting of atezolizumab, Avelumab, Durvalumab, BMS-936559 and CK-301. 23. A pharmaceutical composition comprising: (a) IL33 and (b) a PD-1 and/or PD-L1 inhibitor.
24. A pharmaceutical composition for use in treatment of PDAC comprising: (a) IL33 and (b) a PD-1 and/or PD-L1 inhibitor.
25. A method of treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in a subject in need thereof, the method comprising: (a) administering to a recipient subject with PDAC an effective amount of activated donor pancreatic ILC2 cells, wherein the donor pancreatic ILC2 cells have been obtained from donor subject and activated ex vivo/in vitro by contact with IL33, and wherein the donor subject and the recipient subject are of the same species, thereby treating the PDAC in the recipient subject.
26. A method of treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in a subject in need thereof, the method comprising: (a) contacting donor pancreatic ILC2 cells obtained from a donor subject with IL33 ex vivo/in vitro to produce activated donor pancreatic ILC2 cells, and (b) administering the donor activated pancreatic ILC2 cells to a recipient subject having pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), wherein the donor subject and the recipient subject are of the same species, thereby treating the PDAC in the recipient subject.
27. A method of treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in a subject in need thereof, the method comprising: (a) obtaining donor pancreatic ILC2 cells from a donor subject, (b) contacting the donor pancreatic ILC2 cells with IL33 ex vivo/in vitro to produce activated donor pancreatic ILC2 cells, and (c) administering the activated donor pancreatic ILC2 cells to a recipient subject having pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), wherein the donor subject and the recipient subject are of the same species, thereby treating the PDAC in the recipient subject.
28. A method according to any of claims 25-27, further comprising expanding the donor pancreatic ILC2 cells and/or activated donor pancreatic ILC2 cells ex vivo/in vitro prior to administering the activated donor pancreatic ILC2 cells to the recipient subject.
