INFORMATION PROCESSING APPARATUS, INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided an information processing apparatus, information processing method, and program, capable of accurately performing the future prediction of a user-specific physical condition and giving advice accordingly. The information processing apparatus includes a prediction unit configured to predict a future physical condition of a user on the basis of a sensor information history including information relating to the user acquired from a sensor around the user, and a generation unit configured to generate advice for bringing the physical condition closer to an ideal physical body specified by the user on the basis of the predicted physical condition, and lifestyle information and preference information of the user obtained from the sensor information history.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An information processing apparatus comprising: a prediction unit configured to predict a future physical condition of a user on a basis of a sensor information history including information relating to the user acquired from a sensor around the user; and a generation unit configured to generate advice for bringing the physical condition closer to an ideal physical body specified by the user on a basis of the predicted physical condition, and lifestyle information and preference information of the user obtained from the sensor information history.
2. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the physical condition includes at least one of an inner element or an outer element of a physical body.
3. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the ideal physical body includes at least one of an inner element or an outer element of a physical body.
4. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the inner element is an element relating to a health condition, and the outer element is an element relating to a body shape.
5. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the prediction unit predicts the physical condition on a basis of at least one of the user's lifestyle information or preference information obtained from the sensor information history.
6. The information processing apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the lifestyle information is information relating to exercise and diet of the user and is acquired from an action history and information relating to a meal of the user included in the sensor information history.
7. The information processing apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the preference information is information relating to an intake amount and intake timing of a personal preference item consumed by the user.
8. The information processing apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the prediction unit analyzes a current whole-body image of the user obtained from the sensor information history to obtain an outer element of a current physical body of the user, and predicts the physical condition after a lapse of a specified predetermined time on a basis of the user's lifestyle information and preference information by setting the outer element of the current physical body as a reference.
9. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the sensor around the user includes a sensor provided in an information processing terminal held by the user or an ambient environmental sensor.
10. The information processing apparatus according to claim 9, wherein the sensor around the user is a camera, a microphone, a weight sensor, a biometric sensor, an acceleration sensor, an infrared sensor, or a position detector.
11. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the sensor information history includes information input by the user, information acquired from the Internet, or information acquired from an information processing terminal held by the user.
12. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the generation unit generates, as the advice for bringing the physical condition closer to the ideal physical body, advice relating to excessive intake or insufficient intake of a personal preference item on a basis of the preference information of the user.
13. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the advice is presented to the user as counsel from a specific character or a person preferred by the user on a basis of liking/preference of the user.
14. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the ideal physical body is input as a parameter by the user.
15. An information processing method, by a processor, comprising: predicting a future physical condition of a user on a basis of a sensor information history including information relating to the user acquired from a sensor around the user; and generating advice for bringing the physical condition closer to an ideal physical body specified by the user on a basis of the predicted physical condition, and lifestyle information and preference information of the user obtained from the sensor information history,
16. A program for causing a computer to function as: a prediction unit configured to predict a future physical condition of a user on a basis of a sensor information history including information relating to the user acquired from a sensor around the user; and a generation unit configured to generate advice for bringing the physical condition closer to an ideal physical body specified by the user on a basis of the predicted physical condition, and lifestyle information and preference information of the user obtained from the sensor information history.
