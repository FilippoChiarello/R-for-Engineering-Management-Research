SYSTEMS AND METHODS AUTHENTICATING A DIGITALLY SIGNED ASSERTION USING VERIFIED EVALUATORS
</title>

<abstract>
A system for authenticating a requesting device using verified evaluators includes an authenticating device. The authenticating device is designed and configured to receive at least a first digitally signed assertion from a requesting device, the at least a first digitally signed assertion linked to at least a verification datum, evaluate at least a second digitally signed assertion, signed by at least a cryptographic evaluator, conferring a credential to the requesting device, validate the credential, as a function of the at least a second digitally signed assertion, and authenticate the requesting device based on the credential.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of authenticating a requesting device using verified evaluators, the method
comprising:
receiving, by an authenticating device, at least a first digitally signed assertion from a
requesting device, the at least a first digitally signed assertion linked to at least a verification datum;
evaluating, by the authenticating device, at least a second digitally signed assertion, signed by at least a cryptographic evaluator, conferring a credential to the requesting device; validating, by the authenticating device, the credential as a function of the at least a second digitally signed assertion; and
authenticating, by the authenticating device, the requesting device based on the credential.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein receiving further comprises receiving a credential renewal request.
3. The method of claim 2 further comprising generating a new credential as a function of
credential
4. The method of claim 3 further comprising posting the new credential to a temporally
sequential listing.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein validating further comprises:
determining a confidence level in the at least a cryptographic evaluator; and
validating the credential as a function of the confidence level.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the second digitally signed assertion includes a plurality of digitally signed assertions generated by a plurality of cryptographic evaluators.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein validation further comprises:
determining an aggregate confidence level in the plurality of cryptographic evaluators;
comparing the aggregate confidence level to a validation threshold; and
validating the credential as a function of the determination.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein:
the credential includes an expiration period; and
validation further comprises determining that the credential is current, based on the
expiration period.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein validation further comprises determining that the credential is not on a revocation list.
10. The method of claim 1 further comprising transmitting, to a cryptographic evaluator, a secondary authentication request.
11. The method of claim 10 further comprising receiving, from the cryptographic evaluator, an identifier of the requesting device.
12. The method of claim 1 further comprising determining a scope of authorization based on the credential.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein
receiving the at least a first digitally signed assertion further comprises receiving an
authorization request to execute an application; and
authentication further comprises determining that the scope of authorization includes the application.
14. A system for authenticating a requesting device using verified evaluators, the system
comprising:
an authenticating device, wherein the authenticating device is designed and configured to receive at least a first digitally signed assertion from a requesting device, the at least a first digitally signed assertion linked to at least a verification datum, evaluate at least a second digitally signed assertion, signed by at least a cryptographic evaluator, conferring a credential to the requesting device, validate the credential, as a function of the at least a second digitally signed assertion, and authenticate the requesting device based on the credential.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the authenticating device is further configured to receive a credential renewal request.
16. The system of claim 14, wherein the second digitally signed assertion includes a plurality of digitally signed assertions generated by a plurality of cryptographic evaluators.
17. The system of claim 14, wherein:
the credential includes an expiration period; and
validation further comprises determining that the credential is current, based on the
expiration period.
18. The system of claim 14, wherein the authenticating device is further configured to transmit, to a cryptographic evaluator, a secondary authentication request.
19. The system of claim 18 wherein the authenticating device is further configured to receive, from the cryptographic evaluator, an identifier of the requesting device. 20 The system of claim 1 wherein the authenticating device is further configured to determine a scope of authorization based on the credential.
