<title>
Orthogonal path renderer for natural looking sequence flows
</title>

<abstract>
Implementations generally relate to rendering orthogonal lines in a sequence flow. In some implementations, a method includes determining, in a user interface of a client device, a first location of a first process node of a process and a second location of a second process node of the process. The method further includes determining, in the user interface, a control location of a control point for a sequence flow process element. The method further includes placing an orthogonal line between the first location and the second location, wherein the orthogonal line is selected from a plurality of predetermined orthogonal lines based on the control location, the first location, and the second location.
