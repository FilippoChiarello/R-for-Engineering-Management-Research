KNOWLEDGE-BASED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT DESIGN
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for data-driven recommendations during infrastructure project design. Input data, which may comprise technical data and stakeholder data, is passed to a design module. Based on that data, the design module recommends a design for the infrastructure project and recommends components to be used in the design. The design is then passed to a fleet selection module for identifying logistical needs of the design; to a cost estimation module for predicting the cost of the design; to a deterioration-forecaster module for predicting the rate of deterioration of the design components; and a scheduling module for scheduling construction tasks while accounting for logistical needs. The user is then presented with a project design and that design's logistical requirements, projected costs, likely maintenance requirements, and scheduling needs. The user may modify the design and the system may recommend additional modifications.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A system for predicting deterioration values of components of an infrastructure project, said system comprising: an input module for receiving input data related to said infrastructure project; a design module for determining said components, based on said input data, and for verifying said components with a user; and a deterioration-forecaster module for predicting said deterioration values for said components, wherein said predicting is based on said input data.
2. The system according to claim 1, wherein said predicting is also based on known data.
3. The system according to claim 2, wherein said system further comprises at least one database for storing said known data, and wherein said input module and said deterioration-forecaster module are in operative communication with said database.
4. The system according to claim 2, wherein said system comprises a machine-learning-based module.
5. The system according to claim 1, wherein said infrastructure project is a construction of a bridge.
6. A system for scheduling tasks related to an infrastructure project, said system comprising: an input module for receiving input data related to said infrastructure project; a design module for recommending a design of said infrastructure project to a user; a fleet selection module for identifying logistical needs of said infrastructure project, wherein said needs are identified based on said input data; and a scheduling module for identifying said tasks and for producing a schedule for said tasks, wherein said tasks are identified and scheduled based on said design and on said logistical needs.
7. The system according to claim 6, wherein at least one of said tasks and said logistical needs are identified based on previous known data.
8. The system according to claim 6, further comprising at least one database in operative communication with at least one of said fleet selection module and said scheduling module.
9. The system according to claim 6, further comprising at least one machine-learning based module.
10. The system according to claim 6, wherein said infrastructure project is a construction of a bridge.
11. A system for making recommendations related to an infrastructure project, said system comprising: an input module for receiving project-related data from a user; a design module for performing at least one analysis of said project-related data, and for, based on said analysis, recommending a design for said infrastructure project and components of said infrastructure project to said user; a fleet selection module for predicting logistical needs of said infrastructure project; a cost estimation module for predicting costs related to said infrastructure project; a deterioration-forecaster module for predicting deterioration values of said components; and a scheduling module for identifying tasks related to said infrastructure project and for producing a schedule of said tasks, wherein said tasks are identified and scheduled based on said design and on said logistical needs.
12. The system according to claim 11, wherein said logistical needs, said costs, said deterioration, and said schedule are presented to said user for approval.
13. The system according to claim 11, further comprising at least one database in operative communication with at least one of said design module, said fleet selection module, said cost estimation module, said deterioration-forecaster module, and said scheduling module.
14. The system according to claim 11, wherein at least one of said design module, said fleet selection module, said cost estimation module, said deterioration-forecaster module, and said scheduling module uses fuzzy logic.
15. The system according to claim 11, wherein at least one of said design module, said fleet selection module, said cost estimation module, said deterioration-forecaster module, and said scheduling module uses machine learning.
16. The system according to claim 11, wherein said infrastructure project is a construction of a bridge.
