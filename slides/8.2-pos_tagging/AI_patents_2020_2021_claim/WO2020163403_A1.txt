B. selecting a subset of the genomic regions, wherein the selection is made when cfDNA molecules corresponding to, or derived from each of the genomic regions in HD samples have an abnormal methylation pattern, wherein the abnormal methylation pattern comprises at least five methylation sites either
hypomethylated or hypermethyl ated, and
C. designing an HD assay panel comprising a plurality of probes, wherein each of the probes is configured to hybridize to a converted cfDNA molecule corresponding to or derived from one or more of the subset of the genomic regions.
118. The method of claim 117, wherein the converted cfDNA molecules comprise cfDNA molecules treated to convert unmethylated cytosines to uracils.
119. A hematological disorder (HD) assay panel comprising a plurality of probes, wherein each of the plurality of probes is configured to hybridize to a converted cfDNA molecule corresponding to one or more of the genomic regions in any one of Lists 1-8.
120. The hematological disorder (HD) assay panel of claim 119, wherein the converted
cfDNA molecules comprise cfDNA molecules treated to convert unmethylated cytosines to uracils.
121. The HD assay panel of claim 120, wherein the plurality of probes is configured to
hybridize to a plurality of converted cfDNA molecules corresponding to or derived from at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90%, 95% or 100% of the genomic regions of any one of Lists 1-8.
122. The HD assay panel of claim 120, wherein the plurality of probes is configured to
hybridize to a plurality of converted cfDNA molecules corresponding to or derived from at least 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1,000, 5000, 10,000, 15,000, 16,000, 17,000,
18,000, 19,000, 20,000, 21,000 or 23,000 genomic regions of any one of Lists 1-8.
123. The HD assay panel of any one of claims 120-122, wherein at least 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% of the probes comprise no G (Guanine).
124. The HD assay panel of any one of claims 120-122, wherein each of the probes comprise multiple binding sites to methylation sites of the converted cfDNA molecule, wherein at least 80, 85, 90, 92, 95, or 98% of the multiple binding sites comprise exclusively either CpG or CpA.
125. The HD assay panel of any one of claims 120-124, wherein each of the probes is
conjugated to a non-nucleotide affinity moiety.
126. The HD assay panel of claim 125, wherein the non-nucleotide affinity moiety is a biotin moiety.
