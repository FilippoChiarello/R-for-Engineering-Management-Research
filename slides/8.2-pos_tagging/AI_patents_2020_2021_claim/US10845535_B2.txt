<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided for processing an optical signal. An example system may include a source disposed on a substrate and capable of emitting the optical signal. A first waveguide is formed in the substrate to receive the optical signal. A first coupler is disposed on the substrate to receive a reflected portion of the optical signal. A second waveguide is formed in the substrate to receive the reflected portion from the first coupler. A second coupler is formed in the substrate to mix the optical signal and the reflected portion to form a mixed signal. Photodetectors are formed in the substrate to convert the mixed signal to an electrical signal. A processor is electrically coupled to the substrate and programmed to convert the electrical signal from a time domain to a frequency domain to determine a phase difference between the optical signal and the reflected portion.
