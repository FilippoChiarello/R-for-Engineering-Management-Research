MODIFYING AN APPEARANCE OF A GUI TO IMPROVE GUI USABILITY
</title>

<abstract>
In one or more embodiments of the present invention, a method modifies a graphical user interface (GUI) for an application to improve GUI usability. One or more processors identify a non-intuitive icon on a current graphical user interface (GUI) The processor(s) match the non-intuitive icon to a traditional icon that performs a same function as the non-intuitive icon when selected by a user. The processor(s) replace the non-intuitive icon with the traditional icon on the current GUI.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising: identifying, by one or more processors, a non-intuitive icon on a current graphical user interface (GUI); matching, by one or more processors, the non-intuitive icon to a traditional icon that performs a same function as the non-intuitive icon when selected by a user; and replacing, by one or more processors, the non-intuitive icon with the traditional icon on the current GUI.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the traditional icon is identified as an icon that is historically used more frequently than the non-intuitive icon on other GUIs.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the non-intuitive icon visually suggests a function that is contrary to a function of the traditional icon.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the non-intuitive icon is labeled with a label that does not match an intended purpose of the non-intuitive icon and the traditional icon.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the non-intuitive icon is labeled with a non-intuitive label that does not match an intended purpose of the non-intuitive icon and the traditional icon, and wherein the traditional icon is labeled with an intuitive label that matches the intended purpose of the non-intuitive icon and the traditional icon.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the non-intuitive icon is initially placed in a first location on the current GUI, and wherein the traditional icon that replaces the non-intuitive icon is placed in a different second location on the current GUI.
7. A computer program product for modifying a graphical user interface (GUI) for an application to improve usability of the current GUI, the computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable storage medium having program code embodied therewith, the program code readable and executable by a processor to perform a method comprising: identifying a non-intuitive icon on a current graphical user interface (GUI); matching the non-intuitive icon to a traditional icon that performs a same function as the non-intuitive icon when selected by a user; and replacing the non-intuitive icon with the traditional icon on the current GUI.
8. The computer program product of claim 7, wherein the traditional icon is identified as an icon that is historically used more frequently than the non-intuitive icon on other GUIs.
9. The computer program product of claim 7, wherein the non-intuitive icon visually suggests a function that is contrary to a function of the traditional icon.
10. The computer program product of claim 7, wherein the non-intuitive icon is labeled with a label that does not match an intended purpose of the non-intuitive icon and the traditional icon.
11. The computer program product of claim 7, wherein the non-intuitive icon is labeled with a non-intuitive label that does not match an intended purpose of the non-intuitive icon and the traditional icon, and wherein the traditional icon is labeled with an intuitive label that matches the intended purpose of the non-intuitive icon and the traditional icon.
12. The computer program product of claim 7, wherein the non-intuitive icon is initially placed in a first location on the current GUI, and wherein the traditional icon that replaces the non-intuitive icon is placed in a different second location on the current GUI.
13. The computer program product of claim 7, wherein the program code is provided as a service in a cloud environment.
14. A computer system comprising one or more processors, one or more computer readable memories, and one or more computer readable non-transitory storage mediums, and program instructions stored on at least one of the one or more computer readable non-transitory storage mediums for execution by at least one of the one or more processors via at least one of the one or more computer readable memories, the stored program instructions executed to perform a method comprising: identifying a non-intuitive icon on a current graphical user interface (GUI); matching the non-intuitive icon to a traditional icon that performs a same function as the non-intuitive icon when selected by a user; and replacing the non-intuitive icon with the traditional icon on the current GUI.
15. The computer system of claim 14, wherein the traditional icon is identified as an icon that is historically used more frequently than the non-intuitive icon on other GUIs.
16. The computer system of claim 14, wherein the non-intuitive icon visually suggests a function that is contrary to a function of the traditional icon.
17. The computer system of claim 14, wherein the non-intuitive icon is labeled with a label that does not match an intended purpose of the non-intuitive icon and the traditional icon.
18. The computer system of claim 14, wherein the non-intuitive icon is labeled with a non-intuitive label that does not match an intended purpose of the non-intuitive icon and the traditional icon, and wherein the traditional icon is labeled with an intuitive label that matches the intended purpose of the non-intuitive icon and the traditional icon.
19. The computer system of claim 14, wherein the non-intuitive icon is initially placed in a first location on the current GUI, and wherein the traditional icon that replaces the non-intuitive icon is placed in a different second location on the current GUI.
20. The computer system of claim 14, wherein the stored program instructions are provided as a service in a cloud environment.
