<title>
Brand personality comparison engine
</title>

<abstract>
Mechanisms are provided to implement a brand comparison engine. The mechanisms receive a request to compare brand personalities of a first specified brand and a second specified brand and obtain a first brand personality scale associated with the first specified brand and a second brand personality scale associated with the second specified brand. The mechanisms calculate at least one gap value indicating a difference between at least one personality trait in the first brand personality scale and a corresponding at least one personality trait in the second brand personality scale. The mechanisms also output an output indicating an aspect of the at least one gap based on the calculation.

<claims>
1. A method, in a data processing system comprising a processor and a memory, the memory comprising instructions which when executed by the processor configure the processor to implement a brand personality and recommendation system that operates to perform the method comprising: training, by the brand personality and recommendation system executing in the data processing system, one or more brand personality computer models, using a machine learning computer operation, to identify brand personality traits based on first crowdsource information obtained from one or more first crowdsource computing systems; receiving, by a brand comparison engine of the brand personality and recommendation system, a request to compare brand personalities of a first specified brand and a second specified brand; generating, by the brand comparison engine, a first brand personality scale comprising one or more first brand personality traits associated with the first specified brand, and a second brand personality scale comprising one or more second brand personality traits associated with the second specified brand, based on an execution of the trained one or more brand personality computer models on features extracted from second crowdsource information obtained from one or more second crowdsource computing systems; calculating, by the brand comparison engine, at least one gap value indicating a difference between at least one first personality trait in the first brand personality scale and a corresponding at least one second personality trait in the second brand personality scale; determining, by the brand comparison engine, based on the calculated at least one gap value, whether or not the second specified brand is a competitor of the first specified brand; and outputting, by the brand comparison engine, an output indicating whether or not the second specified brand is a competitor of the first specified brand based on results of the determining.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: obtaining, by the brand comparison engine, from a crowdsource information source, crowdsource information, wherein the crowdsource information comprises natural language content submitted by a plurality of providers to the crowdsource information source; identifying, by the brand comparison engine, for each of the first specified brand and the second specified brand, providers in the plurality of providers providing portions of the crowdsource information directed to the corresponding first specified brand or second specified brand to thereby generate a first set of providers associated with the first specified brand and a second set of providers associated with the second specified brand; and calculating, by the brand comparison engine, a first global personality representation of the providers in the first set of providers and a second global personality representation of the providers in the second set of providers.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein calculating the at least one gap value comprises calculating the at least one gap value between the first global personality representation and the second global personality representation.
4.

7. The method of claim 4, further comprising: determining, based on the calculated degree of overlap between the first set of providers and the second set of providers, whether or not the second specified brand is a potential partner of the first specified brand; and outputting, as part of the output, an indication of whether or not the second specified brand is a potential partner of the first specified brand.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein determining whether or not the second specified brand is a potential partner of the first specified brand comprises calculating a ratio of a number of providers present in the first set of providers that are also present in the second set of providers, to a total number of unique providers in the first set of providers and the second set of providers, wherein in response to the ratio having a value equal to or greater than a threshold value, the second specified brand is determined to be a potential partner of the first specified brand.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising grouping a plurality of brands into a plurality of groupings based on the brands being associated with similar entities such that brands in a same group are comparable or complementary brands, wherein the first specified brand and the second specified brand are in a same identified group and are comparable or complementary brands.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising: calculating, by the brand comparison engine, a degree of brand personality singularity for the first specified brand in the identified group, wherein the degree of brand personality singularity for the first specified brand in the identified group is a measure of a first variance between brand personality traits of the brand personality scale associated with the first identified brand and a second variance between the brand personality scale of the first identified brand and a brand personality scale of the second identified brand.
11. A computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable storage medium having a computer readable program stored therein, wherein the computer readable program, when executed on a data processing system, causes the data processing system to execute instructions configuring the data processing system to implement a brand comparison engine personality and recommendation system that operates to: train, by the brand personality and recommendation system executing in the data processing system, one or more brand personality computer models, using a machine learning computer operation, to identify brand personality traits based on first crowdsource information obtained from one or more first crowdsource computing systems; receive, by a brand comparison engine of the brand personality and recommendation system, a request to compare brand personalities of a first specified brand and a second specified brand; generate, by the brand comparison engine, a first brand personality scale comprising one or more first brand personality traits associated with the first specified brand, and a second brand personality scale comprising one or more second brand personality traits associated with the second specified brand, based on an execution of the trained one or more brand personality computer models on features extracted from second crowdsource information obtained from one or more second crowdsource computing systems; calculate, by the brand comparison engine, at least one gap value indicating a difference between at least one first personality trait in the first brand personality scale and a corresponding at least one second personality trait in the second brand personality scale; determine, by the brand comparison engine, based on the calculated at least one gap value, whether or not the second specified brand is a competitor of the first specified brand; and output, by the brand comparison engine, an output indicating whether or not the second specified brand is a competitor of the first specified brand based on results of the determining.
