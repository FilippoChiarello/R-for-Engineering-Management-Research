BIOMARKERS AND METHODS FOR TREATMENT WITH NAE INHIBITORS
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein are markers whose mutational status is associated with sensitivity to treatment with NAE inhibitors. Mutational status is determined by measurement of characteristics of markers corresponding to the marker genes. Compositions and methods are provided to assess markers of marker genes to predict response to NAE inhibition treatment.
