<title>
VEHICLE ACCESS AND POWER MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND METHODS VIA MACHINE LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
A method for access to a vehicle includes receiving data from an identification device related to at least one device environment sensor of the identification device. At least one pattern associated with the received data is identified. An environment of the identification device based on feedback from the at least one device environment sensor is determined. The environment to the at least one pattern is compared. In response to the comparing step, access to the vehicle is allowed or denied.

<claims>
1. A method for access to a vehicle, the method comprising: receiving data from an identification device related to at least one device environment sensor of the identification device; identifying at least one pattern associated with the received data; determining an environment of the identification device based on feedback from the at least one device environment sensor; comparing the environment to the at least one pattern; and in response to the comparing step, allowing or denying access to the vehicle.
2. The method as recited in claim 1, the method comprising: in response to the comparing step, altering a search and listen pattern between the vehicle and the identification device.
3. The method as recited in claim 1, the method comprising: in response to the comparing step, changing a power condition of a device of the vehicle.
4. The method as recited in claim 3, wherein the device is a transceiver associated with a communication interface between the vehicle and the identification device.
5. The method as recited in claim 3, wherein the changing a power condition includes powering up the device.
6. The method as recited in claim 3, wherein the changing a power condition includes powering down the device.
7. The method as recited in claim 1, the method comprising: receiving data from the vehicle related to at least one vehicle environment sensor of the vehicle; identifying a second pattern associated with the received vehicle environment data; determining a vehicle environment of the vehicle based on feedback from the at least one vehicle environment sensor; and comparing the vehicle environment to the second pattern, wherein the allowing or denying access step is in response to the comparing the vehicle environment step.
8. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the identifying the pattern step is performed using machine learning.
9. The method as recited in claim 8, wherein the machine learning utilizes an algorithm and model programmed into an ECU system of the vehicle.
10. A method for power management of a vehicle, the method comprising: receiving data from an identification device related to at least one device environment sensor of the identification device; identifying at least one pattern associated with the received data; determining an environment of the identification device based on feedback from the at least one device environment sensor; comparing the environment to the at least one pattern; and in response to the comparing step, changing a power condition of a device of the vehicle.
11. The method as recited in claim 10, wherein the device is a transceiver associated with a communication interface between the vehicle and the identification device.
12. The method as recited in claim 10, wherein the changing a power condition includes powering up the device.
13. The method as recited in claim 10, wherein the changing a power condition includes powering down the device.
14. The method as recited in claim 10, the method comprising: in response to the comparing step, altering a search and listen pattern between the vehicle and the identification device.
15. The method as recited in claim 10, the method comprising: identifying that the identification device is stationary and charging; and reducing a frequency of a search and listen pattern between the vehicle and the identification device.
16. A power management and access system for a vehicle, comprising an ECU system; at least one lock in communication with the ECU system; and one or more devices in communication with the ECU system, wherein the ECU system is configured to utilize machine learning to receive data from an identification device related to at least one device environment sensor of the identification device, identify at least one pattern associated with the received data, determine an environment of the identification device based on feedback from the at least one device environment sensor, compare the environment to the at least one pattern, and, in response to the comparison, send a signal to control the at least one lock to allow or deny access to the vehicle.
17. The power management system as recited in claim 16, wherein the ECU system is configured to change a power condition of the one or more devices in response to the comparison.
18. The power management system as recited in claim 16, wherein the ECU system is configured to alter a search and listen pattern between the vehicle and the identification device in response to the comparison.
