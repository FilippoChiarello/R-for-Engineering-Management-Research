HERMETICALLY SEALED CAMERA WITH A GRAPHICAL PROCESSING UNIT (GPU)
</title>

<abstract>
The present application is directed to an apparatus including a hermetically sealed housing. The hermetically sealed housing includes an external heat sink integrated with the hermetically sealed housing as a single unit. the external heat sink includes protrusions extending up to an entire length of a surface of the hermetically sealed housing. The apparatus also includes a camera disposed within the hermetically sealed housing. The camera includes a lens and a motor that physically adjusts the lens. The apparatus also includes a graphics processing unit (GPU) coupled to the camera. The GPU is configured to process image information of an image captured by the camera.
