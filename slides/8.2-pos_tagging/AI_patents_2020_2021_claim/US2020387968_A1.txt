SYSTEM AND METHOD OF A SMART CONTRACT THAT AUTOMATICALLY RESTRUCTURES DEBT LOAN
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for facilitating foreclosure on collateral is disclosed. An example system may include a lending agreement storage circuit structured to store a plurality of lending agreement data comprising at least one lending agreement, wherein the lending agreement comprises a lending condition data comprising terms and condition data of the at least one lending agreement related to a foreclosure condition on at least one asset that provides a collateral condition related to a collateral asset for securing a repayment obligation of the at least one lending agreement; a data collection services circuit structured to monitor the lending condition data and to detect a default condition based on a change to the lending condition data; and a smart contract services circuit structured to interpret the default condition and communicate a default condition indication that initiates a foreclosure procedure based on the collateral condition and the default condition.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system for facilitating foreclosure on collateral, comprising: a lending agreement storage circuit structured to store a plurality of lending agreement data comprising at least one lending agreement, wherein the at least one lending agreement comprises a lending condition data, the lending condition data comprising terms and condition data of the at least one lending agreement related to a foreclosure condition on at least one asset that provides a collateral condition related to a collateral asset for securing a repayment obligation of the at least one lending agreement; a data collection services circuit structured to monitor the lending condition data and to detect a default condition based on a change to the lending condition data; and a smart contract services circuit structured to interpret the default condition and communicate a default condition indication that initiates a foreclosure procedure based on the collateral condition and the default condition.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the smart contract services circuit is further structured to communicate the default condition indication to at least one of a smart lock or a smart container to lock the collateral asset.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the foreclosure procedure configures and at least one of initiates a listing of the collateral asset on a public auction site or delivers a plurality of transport instructions for the collateral asset.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the foreclosure procedure configures a plurality of instructions for at least one of a drone or a robotic device to transport the collateral asset.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the foreclosure procedure initiates a process for automatically substituting a set of substitute collateral.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the foreclosure procedure initiates a collateral tracking procedure.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the foreclosure procedure initiates at least one of a process for automatically substituting a set of substitute collateral, a collateral tracking procedure, a collateral valuation process, or a message to a borrower initiating a negotiation regarding the foreclosure.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the negotiation is managed by a robotic process automation system trained on a training set of foreclosure negotiations.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein the negotiation relates to modification of at least one of an interest rate, a payment term, or a collateral for the at least one lending agreement.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the data collection services circuit further comprises at least one system selected from the systems consisting of: an Internet of Things system, a camera system, a networked monitoring system, an internet monitoring system, a mobile device system, a wearable device system, a user interface system, and an interactive crowdsourcing system.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein each of the lending agreement storage circuit, data collection services circuit, and smart contract services circuit further comprise a corresponding application programming interface (API) component structured to facilitate communication among the circuits of the system.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the corresponding API components of the circuits further comprise user interfaces structured to interact with a plurality of users of the system.
13. A method for facilitating foreclosure on collateral, comprising: storing a plurality of lending agreement data comprising at least one lending agreement, wherein the at least one lending agreement comprises a lending condition data, the lending condition data comprising terms and condition data of the at least one lending agreement related to a foreclosure condition on at least one asset that provides a collateral condition related to a collateral asset for securing a repayment obligation of the at least one lending agreement; monitoring the lending condition data to detect a default condition based on a change to the lending condition data; interpreting the default condition; and communicating a default condition indication that initiates a foreclosure procedure based on the collateral condition.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the default condition indication is communicated to at least one of a smart lock or a smart container to lock the collateral asset.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein the foreclosure procedure comprises at least one of: configuring and initiating a listing of the collateral asset on a public auction site, or delivering transport instructions for the collateral asset.
16. The method of claim 13, wherein the foreclosure procedure configures a plurality of instructions for at least one of a drone or a robotic device to transport the collateral asset.
17. The method of claim 13, wherein the foreclosure procedure initiates at least one of a process for automatically substituting a plurality of substitute collateral, a collateral tracking procedure, a collateral valuation process, or a message to a borrower initiating a negotiation regarding the foreclosure.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the negotiation is managed by a robotic process automation system trained on a training set of foreclosure negotiations.
19. The method of claim 17, wherein the negotiation relates to modification of at least one of an interest rate, a payment term, or a collateral for the at least one lending agreement.
20. The method of claim 13, further comprising: providing a user interface to interact with a plurality of users, wherein providing communications for monitoring, interpreting, and communicating are through an application programming interface (API), and wherein the user interface incorporates the API.
