MAINTENANCE RANGE OPTIMIZATION APPARATUS, MAINTENANCE RANGE OPTIMIZATION METHOD, AND COMPUTER-READABLE RECORDING MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A maintenance range optimization apparatus 10 optimizes a range of maintenance on an object that requires maintenance at a plurality of places. The maintenance range optimization apparatus 10 includes a learning processing unit 20 that executes machine learning, using, as learning data, information from when maintenance was previously executed, including a pre-maintenance state, a maintenance cost and a movement cost of a place subjected to maintenance, and constructs a model indicating a relationship between the range of maintenance and an overall cost incurred in maintenance, and a maintenance range setting unit 30 that sets the range of maintenance using the model.

<claims>
1. A maintenance range optimization apparatus for optimizing a range of maintenance on an object that requires maintenance at a plurality of places, the apparatus comprising: a learning processing unit configured to execute machine learning, using, as learning data, information from when maintenance was previously executed, including a pre-maintenance state, a maintenance cost and a movement cost of a place subjected to maintenance, and construct a model indicating a relationship between the range of maintenance and an overall cost in the long run including risk incurred by deteriorated objects; and a maintenance range setting unit configured to set the range of maintenance using the model.
2. The maintenance range optimization apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the learning processing unit executes Q-learning as the machine learning, and constructs a Q function as the model, and the maintenance range setting unit sets the range of maintenance such that a value of the Q function is maximized.
3. A maintenance range optimization method for optimizing a range of maintenance on an object that requires maintenance at a plurality of places, the method comprising: a executing machine learning, using, as learning data, information from when maintenance was previously executed, including a pre-maintenance state, a maintenance cost and a movement cost of a place subjected to maintenance, and constructing a model indicating a relationship between the range of maintenance and an overall cost in the long run including risk incurred by deteriorated objects; and a setting the range of maintenance using the model.
4. The maintenance range optimization method according to claim 3, wherein, in the executing machine learning, Q-learning is executed as the machine learning, and a Q function is constructed as the model, and in the setting the range, the range of maintenance is set such that a value of the Q function is maximized.
5. A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium that includes a program recorded thereon for optimizing, by computer, a range of maintenance on an object that requires maintenance at a plurality of places, the program including instructions that cause the computer to carry out: a executing machine learning, using, as learning data, information from when maintenance was previously executed, including a pre-maintenance state, a maintenance cost and a movement cost of a place subjected to maintenance, and constructing a model indicating a relationship between the range of maintenance and an overall cost in the long run including risk incurred by deteriorated objects; and a setting the range of maintenance using the model.
6. The non-transitory computer-readable recording medium according to claim 5, wherein, in the executing machine learning, Q-learning is executed as the machine learning, and a Q function is constructed as the model, and in the setting the range, the range of maintenance is set such that a value of the Q function is maximized.
