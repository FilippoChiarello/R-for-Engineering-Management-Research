<title>
Formation of Three-Dimensional Organ from Pluripotent Stem Cells
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention solves the following problems [1] to [3] found in conventional methods of preparing a three dimensional structure (organ primordium) by coculturing functional cells with umbilical cord-derived vascular endothelial cells and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells: [1] the quality of resultant organ primordia varies greatly depending on donors; [2] the growth capacities of cell sources are limited; and [3] it is difficult to secure immunocompatibility because cells are derived from different sources. An organ bud prepared from vascular cells, mesenchymal cells and tissue or organ cells, wherein each of the vascular cell, the mesenchymal cell and the tissue or organ cell has been induced from pluripotent stem cells. A method of preparing an organ bud, comprising culturing vascular cells, mesenchymal cells and tissue or organ cells in vitro, wherein each of the vascular cell, the mesenchymal cell and the tissue or organ cell has been induced from pluripotent stem cells.

<claims>
1. An organ bud prepared from vascular cells, mesenchymal cells and tissue or organ cells, wherein each of the vascular cell, the mesenchymal cell and the tissue or organ cell has been induced from pluripotent stem cells.
2. The organ bud of claim 1, which is a structure capable of differentiating into an organ through maturing.
3. 3-4. (canceled)
5. The organ bud of claim 1, wherein the organ cell is hepatocyte and the organ bud is liver bud.
6. The organ bud of claim 5, wherein the hepatocyte is TBX3 positive and ADRA1B positive.
7. The organ bud of claim 1, wherein the mesenchymal cell is CD166 positive and CD31 negative.
8. The organ bud of claim 1, wherein the mesenchymal cell is LHX2 positive and WT1 positive.
9. The organ bud of claim 8, wherein the transcriptions of FOXF1, HLX1, COL4A and ALCAM of the mesenchymal cell are activated and the mesenchymal cell is LHX2 positive, WT1 positive and MIIA positive.
10. The organ bud of claim 1, wherein the vascular cell is CD31 positive and CD144 positive.
11. The organ bud of claim 10, wherein expression of at least one gene selected from the group consisting of PECAM1, CDH5, KDR and CD34 of the vascular cell is increased relative to the corresponding expression in the pluripotent stem cell before directed differentiation.
12. 12-15. (canceled)
16. The organ bud of claim 1, wherein LHX2 and WT1 co-positive cells obtained through the following steps are used as mesenchymal cells: a) culturing pluripotent stem cells in the presence of a β catenin activator and a factor belonging to the TGF-β superfamily, b) then culturing the cells in the presence of a PDGF receptor agonist and a factor belonging to the transforming growth factor β family, and c) further culturing the cells in the presence of an FGF.
17. The organ bud of claim 1, wherein CD166 positive but CD31 negative cells obtained through the following steps are used as mesenchymal cell: a) culturing pluripotent stem cells in the presence of a β catenin activator and a factor belonging to the TGF-β superfamily, b) then culturing the cells in the presence of a PDGF receptor agonist and a factor belonging to the transforming growth factor β family, c) further culturing the cells in the presence of an FGF, and d) subsequently conducting maintenance culture of the cells in a medium for mesenchymal cells.
18. The organ bud of claim 1, wherein CD31 and CD144 co-positive cells obtained through the following steps are used as vascular cells: a) culturing pluripotent stem cells in the presence of a ROCK inhibitor, b) then culturing the cells in the presence of a β catenin activator and a factor belonging to the TGF-β superfamily, and c) further culturing the cells in the presence of a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) agonist and an adenylate cyclase activator.
19. 19-21. (canceled)
22. A method of preparing an organ bud, comprising culturing vascular cells, mesenchymal cells and tissue or organ cells in vitro, wherein each of the vascular cell, the mesenchymal cell and the tissue or organ cell has been induced from pluripotent stem cells.
23. The method of claim 22, wherein the cells are cultured without using scaffold materials.
24. A method of preparing a tissue or an organ, comprising transplanting the organ bud of claim 1 into a non-human animal and differentiating the organ bud into a tissue or an organ.
25. A method of transplanting an organ bud, comprising transplanting the organ bud of claim 1 into a human or a non-human animal.
26. A method of regeneration or function recovery of a tissue or an organ, comprising transplanting the organ bud of claim 1 into a human or a non-human animal and differentiating the organ bud into a tissue or an organ.
27. (canceled)
28. A method of evaluating a drug, comprising using at least one member selected from the group consisting of the organ bud of claim 1.
