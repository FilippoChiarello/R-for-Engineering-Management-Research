ANOMALY DETECTION DEVICE AND ANOMALY DETECTION METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An anomaly detection device detects an anomaly of a potentiometer including a resistor and a movable terminal that moves while contacting the resistor. The anomaly detection device includes a first applier that applies, to one end of the resistor, a first voltage in a first detection period and a second voltage in a second detection period that is consecutive to the first detection period; a second applier that applies, to another end of the resistor, the first voltage in the first detection period and the second voltage in the second detection period; a voltage detector that detects an output voltage from the movable terminal; and an anomaly detector that detects a contact failure of the movable terminal based on the output voltage detected by the voltage detector when an applied voltage applied by each of the first applier and the second applier is changed.
