<title>
DIGITAL APPLICATION INSTRUMENT INSTANTIATION
</title>

<abstract>
Adding an instrument to a digital application comprises a processor for training a machine-learning process based on historic data related to interactions of an instrument with counter-parties and users. The processor receives a request to add the instrument to a digital application associated with a user and accesses data associated with the instrument, the user, and the digital application. The processor enters the accessed data into the machine-learning process and determines a risk score of adding the instrument to the digital application based on the machine-learning process. If the processor determines that the risk score is less than or equal to a configured threshold, the processor adds the instrument to the digital application. If the risk score is greater than the threshold, the processor rejects the addition of the instrument.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method to add instruments to digital applications, comprising: by one or more computing devices: receiving a request to add an instrument to a digital application associated with a user; accessing data associated with the instrument and the user; determining a risk of adding the instrument to the digital application; determining that the risk is less than a configured threshold; and adding the instrument to the digital application.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: training a machine-learning process based on historic data related to interactions of an instrument with counter-parties and users.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, further comprising: entering the accessed data into the machine-learning process.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 3, wherein the determination of the risk is based on an output of the machine-learning process.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, further comprising providing results of subsequent interactions of the instrument to the machine-learning process to further train the machine-learning process.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving a request to add a second instrument to the digital application associated with a user; accessing data associated with the instrument and the user; determining a risk of adding the second instrument to the digital application; determining that the risk is greater than the configured threshold; and declining to add the second instrument to the digital application.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: determining that the risk is equal to a configured threshold; and adding the instrument to the digital application.
8. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein accessing data associated with the instrument comprises accessing data associated with the digital application.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the threshold is configured by one or more of the user, the digital application, an issuer of the instrument, and a card network associated with the instrument.
10. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising utilizing, by the digital application, the instrument in a subsequent interaction with a counter-party.
11. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein a higher risk is an indication that the instrument has a higher likelihood of being fraudulent.
12. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein a lower score is an indication that the instrument has a lower likelihood of being fraudulent.
13. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the digital application is a digital wallet application.
14. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the instrument is a credit card, a debit card, or an access card.
15. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the machine-learning process is a supervised machine-learning model.
16. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the machine-learning process is a gradient boosting decision tree.
17. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the machine-learning process is an unsupervised machine-learning model.
18. A computer program product, comprising: a non-transitory computer-readable storage device having computer-executable program instructions embodied thereon that when executed by a computer cause the computer to add instruments to digital applications, the computer-executable program instructions comprising computer-executable program instructions to: train a machine-learning process based on historic data related to interactions of a payment instrument with counter-parties and users; receive a request to add the payment instrument to a digital wallet associated with a user; access data associated with the instrument and the user; determine a risk score of adding the payment instrument to the digital wallet based on the machine-learning process; determine that the risk score is less than or equal to a configured threshold; and add the payment instrument to the digital wallet.
19. The computer program product of claim 18, further comprising computer-executable program instructions to: receive a request to add a second instrument to the digital application associated with a user; access data associated with the instrument and the user; determine a risk of adding the second instrument to the digital application; determine that the risk is greater than the configured threshold; and decline to add the second instrument to the digital application.
20. A system to add instruments to digital applications, comprising: a storage device; a network device; and a processor communicatively coupled to the storage device and the network device, wherein the processor executes application code instructions that are stored in the storage device to cause the system to: receive a request to add an instrument to a digital application associated with a user; access data associated with the instrument and the user; determine a risk of adding the instrument to the digital application based on an output of a machine-learning process; determine that the risk is less than a configured threshold; and add the instrument to the digital application.
