METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MITIGATING A CHANGE IN AN ORIENTATION OF AN ANTENNA
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the subject disclosure may include a system configured for receiving sensing data from a orientation detector coupled to an antenna, determining, according to the sensing data, that an aperture of the antenna has shifted from a first orientation to a second orientation, and configuring a transmitter to generate an adjusted electromagnetic wave that is supplied to a feed point of the antenna for offsetting the shift in orientation of the antenna. Other embodiments are disclosed.
