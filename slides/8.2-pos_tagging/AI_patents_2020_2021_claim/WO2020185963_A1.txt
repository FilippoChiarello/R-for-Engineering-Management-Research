PORTABLE TERMINAL ACCESSORY DEVICE FOR HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION AND USER INTERFACE
</title>

<abstract>
A holographic display system for a portable electronic device. The display system includes a case configured to receive the portable electronic device and a projector coupled to the case by a first hinge element. The projector includes a projector screen for generating images. A reflective element is coupled to the projector by a second hinge element. The reflective element is oriented to reflect light from the images in order to create holographic images perceptible to a user of the portable electronic device. The case may include a connector for receiving, from the portable electronic device, a video signal defining the images. The holographic display system may further include a substantially transparent touch screen attached to the first hinge element.
