METHOD FOR DETERMINING A PROCESS VARIABLE WITH A CLASSIFIER FOR SELECTING A MODEL FOR DETERMINING THE PROCESS VARIABLE
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to a method for determining at least one process variable of a medium, including steps of recording a sensor signal from a field device and determining a selected model from a set of at least two different models by means of a classifier. Each of the models is used for determining the process variable based at least on the sensor signal. The classifier is designed to select the selected model. The method also includes a step of determining the process variable based at least on the selected model and the sensor signal.

<claims>
1. A method for determining at least one process variable of a medium, including the following method steps: recording a sensor signal from a field device; determining a selected model from a set of at least two different models using a classifier; wherein each of the models is used for determining the process variable at least on the basis of the sensor signal; and wherein the classifier is designed to select the selected model; and determining the process variable at least on the basis of the selected model and the sensor signal.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the classifier is designed to learn the selection of the selected model.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the classifier is trained offline or online.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the classifier is designed to use at least one influencing variable in the selection of the selected model.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the influencing variable is the sensor signal or a variable derived from the sensor signal.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein, based on a data record comprising at least one input variable and an output variable associated with the input variable, a mapping is created, wherein the classifier determines the selected model based on the mapping.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein a feature vector is determined, wherein the classifier is designed to select the selected model based on the feature vector.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein a first and a second classifier are used, wherein the first classifier performs a feature extraction or creates a feature vector, wherein the second classifier selects the selected model based on the feature vector.
9. The method of claim 1, further including determining a classification quality with respect to the selection of the selected model.
10. The method of claim 9, further including evaluating the classification quality using a probability with which the classifier selected the selected model.
11. The method of claim 9, further including detecting a change of the classifier from a first to a second selected model.
12. The method of claim 11, further including determining an alternating frequency between the first and the second selected models or a time interval during which the first or the second selected model is used.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the field device is a field device for determining or monitoring a turbidity, a flow rate, or a fill level of a medium, or for determining a concentration of at least one substance contained in the medium.
14. A computer program for determining at least one process variable of a medium with computer-readable program code which, when executed on a computer, cause the computer to execute the following steps: record a sensor signal from a field device; determine a selected model from a set of at least two different models using a classifier; wherein each of the models is used to determine the process variable based at least on the sensor signal; and wherein the classifier is designed to select the selected model; and determining the process variable at least on the basis of the selected model and the sensor signal.
15. A computer program product stored in a computer readable medium for determining at least one process variable of a medium, comprising: computer code for recording a sensor signal from a field device; computer code for determining a selected model from a set of at least two different models using a classifier; wherein each of the models is used for determining the process variable at least on the basis of the sensor signal; and wherein the classifier is designed to select the selected model; and computer code for determining the process variable at least on the basis of the selected model and the sensor signal.
