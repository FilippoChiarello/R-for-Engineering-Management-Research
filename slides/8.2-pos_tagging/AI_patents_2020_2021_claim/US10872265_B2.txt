<title>
Database for detecting counterfeit items using digital fingerprint records
</title>

<abstract>
Improvements are disclosed for detecting counterfeit objects, based on comparison to digital fingerprints that describe features found in images of objects known to be counterfeit.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: acquiring a first image of a first physical object; extracting first image data from the first image that describes one or more optically discernible features of the first physical object; generating a first digital fingerprint of the first physical object that uniquely identifies the first physical object based on the extracted first image data wherein the first digital fingerprint includes a first piece of data identifying a plurality of locations of interest of the first physical object and, for each location of interest, a second piece of data forming at least one fingerprint feature vector that describes a fingerprint feature extracted from the location of interest; storing the first digital fingerprint in a database, wherein the database stores a plurality of digital fingerprints associated with a plurality of physical objects; acquiring a second image of a second physical object; extracting second image data from the second image that describes one or more optically discernible features of the second physical object; generating a second digital fingerprint of the second physical object based on the extracted second image data; comparing the second digital fingerprint with the first digital fingerprint and at least one of the plurality of digital fingerprints in the database to obtain a result; and executing a predetermined action based on the result.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the first digital fingerprint includes: accessing a predefined pattern associated with a category of physical objects to which the first physical object belongs, the predefined pattern including plural elements; parsing the first image data to extract element values corresponding to the plural elements of the predefined pattern; and generating the first digital fingerprint further based, at least in part, on one or more of the extracted element values.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein a first individual element value for at least one of the plural elements includes a number of pixels within a portion of the first image data.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the comparing comprises: comparing pixel data that represents a concentration of pixels and surrounding white areas associated with the second image to corresponding pixel data that represents concentrations of pixels and surrounding white areas in images associated with at least some of the plurality of digital fingerprints in the database.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein the comparing comprises: comparing a spatial relationship between one or more individual elements of the plural elements of the predefined pattern.
6. The method of claim 2, wherein the result reflects a match between the first physical object and the second physical object that is definitive within a predetermined range or that is above a determined probability or both.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: mapping a location of visible pixels of the second image, and wherein comparing the second digital fingerprint includes comparing mapped locations with mapped location data corresponding to the at least some of the plurality of digital fingerprints.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the second image comprises: a handwritten portion associated with a mailing address, and wherein comparing the second digital fingerprint includes analyzing the handwritten portion to determine a number of transitions from black to white across the handwritten portion.
9. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium whose stored contents configure a computing system to perform a method, the method comprising: acquiring a first image, the first image being an image at least a portion of a first physical object; isolating image data associated with a first portion of the first physical object; creating a first digital fingerprint of the first physical object based on indicia interpreted in the image data, wherein the first digital fingerprint includes a first piece of data identifying a plurality of locations of interest of the first physical object and, for each location of interest, a second piece of data forming at least one fingerprint feature vector that describes a fingerprint feature extracted from the location of interest; and storing the first digital fingerprint in a database, the database having stored therein a plurality of digital fingerprints associated with a plurality of physical objects, wherein the first digital fingerprint identifies the first physical object as being unique among the plurality of objects.
10. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 9 whose stored contents configure the computing system to perform the method, the method further comprising: acquiring a second image, the second image being an image at least a portion of a suspect physical object; isolating second image data associated with the second image that describes one or more optically discernible features of the suspect physical object; generating a second digital fingerprint of the suspect physical object based on the isolated second image data; comparing the second digital fingerprint with the first digital fingerprint and at least one of the plurality of digital fingerprints in the database to obtain a result; and executing a predetermined action based on the result.
11. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 10, whose stored contents configure the computing system to perform the method, wherein the result represents at least a threshold probability that the suspect physical object is an identified one of the plurality of physical objects whose digital fingerprint is stored in the database.
12. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 10, wherein generating the first digital fingerprint includes: accessing a predefined pattern associated with a category of physical objects to which the first physical object belongs, the predefined pattern including plural elements; parsing the first image data to extract element values corresponding to the plural elements of the predefined pattern; and generating the first digital fingerprint further based, at least in part, on one or more of the extracted element values.
13. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 12, wherein a first individual element value for at least one of the plural elements includes a number of pixels within a portion of the first image data.
