DETERMINATION DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A determination device 1 includes: a history storage unit 101 configured to accumulate and store use history information in which application identification information, position information indicating a position of a user, and user identification information are correlated with each other; a use region UU number totaling unit 105 configured to total a UU number for each of a plurality of regions on the basis of the use history information for a specific application; a use region number totaling unit 106 configured to total the number of regions on the basis of the use history information for the specific application; a score calculating unit 107 configured to calculate a regionality score for each of the plurality of regions on the basis of the UU number and the number of regions for the specific application; and a determination unit 108 configured to determine whether there is regionality for the specific application on the basis of the regionality score.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A determination device configured to determine the type of application which is to be provided to a user, the determination device comprising: storage device configured to accumulate and store use history information in which application identification information for identifying an application used by a user, position information indicating a position of the user when the application is used, and user identification information for identifying the user are correlated with each other whenever a plurality of applications are used by a plurality of users; a circuitry configured to total a numerical value indicating a use tendency of a specific application in each of a plurality of regions using the use history information in which a position indicated by the position information is included in the region on the basis of the use history information for the specific application stored in the storage device, total the number of regions including the position indicated by the position information among the plurality of regions using the use history information for the specific application stored in the storage device, calculate a score for each of the plurality of regions on the basis of the numerical value indicating the use tendency and the number of regions for the specific application, and determine whether there is regionality for the specific application on the basis of the score.
2. The determination device according to claim 1, wherein the circuitry totals the number of unique users identified by the user identification information as the numerical value indicating the use tendency.
3. The determination device according to claim 1, further comprising: wherein the storage device stores residence information indicating residences of the users, the circuitry further totals the number of unique users identified by the user identification information using the use history information in which the residences indicated by the residence information of the users identified by the user identification information are included in each of a plurality of residential regions for each of a plurality of applications and each of the plurality of residential regions on the basis of the use history information and the residence information, and the circuitry excludes the application for which at least one of the numbers of unique users in the plurality of residential regions is less than a threshold value from objects to be totaled.
4. The determination device according to claim 1, wherein the circuitry identifies a movement state of the user by determining a change in the position of the user indicated by the position information included in the use history information stored in the storage device, and excludes the use history information in which the movement state has been identified from objects to be totaled on the basis of the movement state identified.
5. The determination device according to claim 1, wherein the storage device stores descriptive information for describing details of each of the plurality of applications; and the circuitry extracts a word associated with a place name from the descriptive information corresponding to the specific application stored in the storage device, and the circuitry determines whether there is regionality on the basis of the score and the word.
6. The determination device according to claim 5, wherein the circuitry determines whether there is regionality by using machine learning with the score and a numerical value based on the word as a feature.
7. The determination device according to claim 6, wherein the numerical value based on the word is a statistical value that is calculated on the basis of a distance between a position identified by the word and a position indicated by the position information included in the use history information for the specific application stored in the storage device.
