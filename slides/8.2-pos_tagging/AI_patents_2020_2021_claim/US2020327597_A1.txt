<abstract>
Systems and methods are disclosed for collecting information on product data related to a product to form a cumulative database, processing the collected information to form product features, calculating values to the product features, processing the values of the product features to compare at least one value of a product feature to a model value to form at least one comparison value, and evaluating the at least one comparison value on basis of information in the cumulative database to form enhancement data for the product.

<claims>
1. A product evaluation system comprising: a collection unit configured for collecting information on product data related to a product to form a cumulative database; a feature unit configured for processing collected information to form product features; a value unit configured for calculating values to the product features; a comparison unit configured for processing values of product features to compare at least one value of a product feature to a model value to form at least one comparison value; and an enhancement unit configured to evaluate the at least one comparison value based on information in the cumulative database to form enhancement data for the product.
2. The product evaluation system of claim 1, where the model value is a key performance indicators (KPI) value.
