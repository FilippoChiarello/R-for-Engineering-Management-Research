<title>
Method And Apparatus Of Collaborative Video Processing Through Learned Resolution Scaling
</title>

<abstract>
In a collaborative video processing method and system, a high resolution video input is optionally downscaled to a low resolution video using a down-sampling filter, followed by an end-to-end video coding system to encode the low resolution video for streaming over the Internet. The original high resolution is obtained at the client end by upscaling the low resolution video using a deep learning based high resolution scaling model, which can be trained in a pre-defined progressive order with low resolution videos having different compression parameters and downscaling factors.

<claims>
1. A system for collaborative video processing, comprising: a content server hosting video content, said video content comprising one or more high resolution videos; a user client; said user client configured to send a request for video content to the content server, comprising a video decoder and a learned resolution scaling module; said request including a request for a high resolution video said content server comprising an optional down-sampling module configured to downscale the high resolution video requested by the user client to a low resolution video at a downscaling factor, a video encoder configured to encode the low resolution video into a bit stream having a bitrate, said bit stream is encapsulated and transmitted to the user client, said downscaling factor is included in metadata of said bit stream; wherein upon receiving the bit stream, the user client decodes the bit stream into video frames using the video decoder and upscale said video frames into a high resolution video using said learned resolution scaling module, wherein said learned resolution scaling module comprising one or more convolutional neural models.
2. The system of claim 1 further comprising a device configured to capture a low resolution video as video content, said device including a camera or a graphical rendering device.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein different video content are downscaled using different downscaling factor and encoded into bit streams having different bit rates.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the video encoder encodes the low resolution video using one or more compression parameters, wherein said one or more compression parameters including quantization parameters.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein said convolutional neural models are trained in a predefined order and using one or more training datasets, said training datasets comprising patches cropped from the video frames and the high resolution video, said predefined order is progressive starting from a low bitrate to a higher bitrate.
6. The system of claim 5, where said convolutional neural models are trained in the content server and the trained conventional neural models are transmitted to the user client
7. The system of claim 6, when the bitrate or resolution of the video content changes, the user client is configured to change the convolutional neural model used for upscaling the video frames.
