<title>
Apparatus and method of data generation for object detection based on generative adversarial networks
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus for generating data based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) is provided. The apparatus includes a first generator configured to receive input data and generate a first fake image, a first discriminator configured to receive the first fake image generated by the first generator and a first real image and verify whether an image is fake or real, a second generator configured to receive the first fake image and generate a second fake image; and a second discriminator configured to receive the second fake image and a second real image and verify whether an image received by the second discriminator is fake or real. The apparatus improves an object recognition performance as compared with a typical object recognition algorithm by generating an image of a class of which a sufficient database is not secured so as to reduce an object misrecognition caused by an insufficient amount of data.

<claims>
1. An apparatus for generating data based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), the apparatus comprising: a first generator configured to receive input data and generate a first fake image; a first discriminator configured to receive the first fake image generated by the first generator and a first real image and verify whether an image received by the first discriminator is fake or real; a second generator configured to receive the first fake image and generate a second fake image; and a second discriminator configured to receive the second fake image generated by the second generator and a second real image and verify whether an image received by the second discriminator is fake or real.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein a size of the first fake image is greater than a size of the second fake image, and a size of the first real image is greater than a size of the second real image.
3. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the size of the second fake image is a size of a target image to be generated.
4. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the sizes of the first fake image and the first real image are as large as one of 4 times, 9 times, 16 times, and 25 times the sizes of the second fake image and the second real image.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the first discriminator, the first generator, the second discriminator, and the second generator are configured to perform machine learning using at least one of a deep neural network (DNN), a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a recurrent neural network (RNN).
6. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising: an image acquirer configured to acquire an image from the second generator; and an object detector configured to detect an object from the image acquired by the image acquirer.
7. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the object detector is configured to detect the object using the CNN trained based on the image acquired by the image acquirer.
8. A method of generating data based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), the method comprising: a first generating operation of receiving input data and generating a first fake image; a first verifying operation of receiving the first fake image generated in the first generating operation and a first real image and verifying whether an image received by the first discriminator is fake or real; a second generating operation of receiving the first fake image and generating a second fake image; and a second verifying operation of receiving the second fake image generated in the second generating operation and a second real image and verifying whether an image received by the second discriminator is fake or real.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein a size of the first fake image is greater than a size of the second fake image and a size of the first real image is greater than a size of the second real image.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the size of the second fake image is a size of a target image to be generated.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the sizes of the first fake image and the first real image are as large as one of 4 times, 9 times, 16 times, and 25 times the sizes of the second fake image and the second real image.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the first generating operation, the first verifying operation, the second generating operation, and the second verifying operation perform machine learning using at least one of a deep neural network (DNN), a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a recurrent neural network (RNN).
13. The method of claim 8, further comprising: an image acquiring operation of acquiring an image generated in the second generating operation; and an object detecting operation of detecting an object from the image acquired in the image acquiring operation.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the object detecting operation detects the object using the CNN trained based on the image acquired by the image acquirer.
