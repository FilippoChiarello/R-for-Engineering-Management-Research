<title>
Hybrid Natural Language Understanding
</title>

<abstract>
Hybrid natural language understanding (NLU) systems and methods are provided that capitalize on the strengths of the rule-based models and the statistical models, lowering the cost of development and increasing the speed of construction, without sacrificing control and accuracy. Two models are used for intent recognition, one statistical and one rule-based. Both models define the same set of intents, but the rule-based model is devoid of any grammars or patterns initially. Each model may or may not be hierarchical in that it may be composed of a set of specialized models that are in a tree form or it may be just a singular model.

<claims>
1. A hybrid natural language understanding (NLU) system, comprising: a rule-based NLU module configured to determine a first intent based on a user input; a statistical NLU module configured to determine a second intent based on the user input; and a decider configured to determine and output a third intent based on the first intent and the second intent.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the rule-based NLU module, the statistical NLU module, and the decider are comprised within a computing device.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the rule-based NLU module, the statistical NLU module, and the decider are comprised within a chatbot.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the chatbot is configured to provide a processed language output based on the third intent.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the rule-based NLU module comprises an intent determiner and at least one of patterns or grammars to determine the first intent.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the statistical NLU module comprises an intent determiner and a trained model of input text over intentions to determine the second intent.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the rule-based NLU module comprises a first confidence value determiner configured to determine a first intent confidence value, and the statistical NLU module comprises a second confidence value determiner configured to determine a second intent confidence value.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the decider is further configured to determine the third intent further based on the first intent confidence value and the second intent confidence value.
9. The system of claim 1, further comprising a training module configured to train the statistical NLU module.
10. The system of claim 1, further comprising a trainer configured to train the decider.
11. A method of hybrid natural language understanding (NLU), the method comprising: receiving an input data at a rule-based NLU module; receiving the input data at a statistical NLU module; determining a first intent at the rule-based NLU module using the input data; determining a second intent at the statistical NLU module using the input data; determining a third intent at a decider using the first intent and the second intent; and outputting the third intent.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising providing a processed language output, by a chatbot, based on the third intent.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein determining the first intent comprises using an intent determiner and at least one of patterns or grammars to determine the first intent.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein determining the second intent comprises using an intent determiner and a trained model of input text over intentions to determine the second intent.
15. The method of claim 11, further comprising determining a first intent confidence value and a second intent confidence value.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein determining the third intent is further based on the first intent confidence value and the second intent confidence value.
17. The method of claim 11, further comprising training the statistical NLU module and the decider.
18. A system comprising: a natural language understanding (NLU) component configured to determine a rule-based NLU intent using an input data, determine a statistical NLU intent using the input data, determine an intent using the rule-based NLU intent and the statistical NLU intent, and outputting a processed language output based on the intent; and a memory that stores training data for the NLU component.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein the input data comprises chat data and wherein the NLU component is comprised within a chatbot.
20. The system of claim 18, wherein the NLU component is further configured to determine a first intent confidence value for the rule-based NLU intent and a second intent confidence value for the statistical NLU intent, and to determine the intent further based on the first intent confidence value and the second intent confidence value.
