VERIFYING IDENTITY OF A VEHICLE ENTERING A TRUST ZONE
</title>

<abstract>
A method includes: receiving, from a vehicle approaching a trust zone, an identifier corresponding to an identity of the vehicle; verifying, by a computing device (e.g., an access server at a gate of the trust zone) and using the identifier, the identity of the vehicle; and comparing the identity of the vehicle with a set of authorized identities stored in a database.
</abstract>

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method comprising:
receiving, from a vehicle approaching a trust zone, an identifier corresponding to an identity of the vehicle;
verifying, by a computing device and using the identifier, the identity of the vehicle; and
comparing the identity of the vehicle with a set of authorized identities stored in a database.
2. The method of claim 1 , wherein a triple is received from the vehicle, the triple includes the identifier, and the identity is verified using the triple.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the triple further includes a public key, the method further comprising:
determining, based on comparing the identity of the vehicle with the set of authorized identities, that the vehicle is authorized to enter the trust zone; and
sending a message to the vehicle, wherein the message is encrypted using the public key, and the message indicates that the vehicle is authorized to enter the trust zone.
4. The method of claim 1 , further comprising, prior to verifying the identity,
receiving a first communication from the vehicle, the first communication requesting access to the trust zone.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising, in response to the first
communication, sending a second communication to the vehicle that requests the identifier.
6. The method of claim 1 , wherein the database is a distributed ledger in which the set of authorized identities is stored as part of a blockchain.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein: the computing device is a first computing device;
a plurality of computing devices, including the first computing device, each control access by vehicles to the trust zone;
each computing device comprises an antenna used to communicate with vehicles or at least one other of the computing devices; and each computing device is configured as a block of the blockchain.
8. The method of claim 1 , further comprising sending a command to the vehicle, wherein the vehicle, in response to receiving the command, stores a new device secret in memory of the vehicle.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the new device secret is associated with an authorization of the vehicle to enter the trust zone.
10. The method of claim 8, further comprising sending, by the computing device, the new device secret to the vehicle.
11. The method of claim 8, further comprising detecting a security risk associated with the vehicle, wherein the computing device sends the command in response to detecting the security risk.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the command is a replace command, the replace command to cause the vehicle to replace a previously-stored device secret with the new device secret.
13. The method of claim 8, wherein the vehicle generates the new device secret in response to receiving the command.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the new device secret is generated using an output from a physical unclonable function.
15. The method of claim 1 , further comprising sending a message to the vehicle, wherein the vehicle generates a triple using the message, and the triple includes the identifier.
16. A system comprising:
at least one processor; and memory containing instructions configured to instruct the at least one processor to:
receive, from a vehicle, an identifier corresponding to an identity of the vehicle;
verify, using the identifier, the identity of the vehicle;
compare the identity of the vehicle with a set of authorized identities stored in memory; and
based on comparing the identity of the vehicle with the set of
authorized identities, transmit a communication to the vehicle that authorizes entry into a trust zone.
17. The system of claim 16, further comprising a plurality of computing devices that control access by vehicles to the trust zone, wherein each computing device comprises an antenna used to communicate with the vehicles or at least one other of the computing devices.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the instructions are further configured to instruct the at least one processor to receive a communication from at least one of the computing devices, the communication including at least one of an identifier for a vehicle, or a certificate for a vehicle.
19. A non-transitory computer storage medium storing instructions which, when executed on a computing device, cause the computing device to at least: receive, from a vehicle approaching a trust zone, an identifier corresponding to an identity of the vehicle;
verify, using the identifier, the identity of the vehicle; and
compare the identity of the vehicle with a set of authorized identities.
20. The non-transitory computer storage medium of claim 19, wherein the
instructions further cause the computing device to:
send a new device secret to the vehicle; and
send a command to the vehicle, wherein the vehicle, in response to receiving the command, stores the new device secret.
