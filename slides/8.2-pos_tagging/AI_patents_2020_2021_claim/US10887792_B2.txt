Pseudo-random label assignments for packets in a transmission burst
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments described herein are generally directed to a sequence encoding engine to apply pseudo-random label assignments to packets within a single transmission burst. They may also include a modulation circuit coupled to the sequence encoding engine to modulate signals to burst transmit the packets. These burst transmissions may travel along a plurality of radio access pathways. In embodiments, the pseudo-random label assignments to the packets within the single transmission burst using a van der Corput sequence, or some other sequence for example a digit-reversed base-N representation of a packet sequence number, wherein N is a number of the selected ones of the plurality of radio access pathways, for example but not limited to a LTE or a Wi-Fi pathway.
