<title>
GUI-implemented cognitive task forecasting
</title>

<abstract>
A method, system, and computer program product for modifying a graphical user interface (GUI) according to cognitively forecasted tasks may collect a set of training data for a cognitive task managing model, where the set of training data associated with a user. The cognitive task managing model is then trained with the set of training data. The cognitive task managing model then processes a set of operational data that is associated with a user. In response to receiving a set of processed data, a task forecast is generated for the user. Based on that forecast, an optimal task for the user is determined. A set of graphical elements within the GUI are modified to notify the user of the optimal task.

<claims>
1. A method for modifying a graphical user interface (GUI) according to cognitively forecasted tasks, the method comprising: collecting a set of training data for a cognitive task managing model, the set of training data associated with a user, wherein the set of training data includes a plurality of univariate time series datasets, and wherein each univariate time series dataset includes collaborative messaging data, application activity data, and scheduled activity data for the user at a particular time; training the cognitive task managing model, using the set of training data; processing, using the cognitive task managing model, a set of operational data associated with the user; in response to receiving a set of processed operational data, generating a task forecast for the user; determining, based on the task forecast, an optimal task for the user; and modifying a set of graphical elements within the GUI to notify the user of the optimal task.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the cognitive task managing model employs a Micro Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (msARIMA).
3. The method of claim 1, wherein collaborative messaging data includes email, text message, instant messaging, collaborative platform communications, and audio communications.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the application activity data includes applications associated with the user that are in use at the particular time.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the scheduled activity data includes calendar entries, program schedules, and historical information associated with the user at the particular time.
6. The method of claim 3, wherein modifying a set of graphical elements within the GUI includes initiating a chat bot to remind the user of the optimal task, wherein the chat bot presents, to the user, an interactive link, via the GUI, that directs the user to a set of resources needed for the optimal task.
7. A computer program product for modifying a graphical user interface (GUI) according to cognitively forecasted tasks, the computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by a device to cause the device to: collect a set of training data for a cognitive task managing model, the set of training data associated with a user, wherein the set of training data includes a plurality of univariate time series datasets, and wherein each univariate time series dataset includes collaborative messaging data, application activity data, and scheduled activity data for the user at a particular time; train the cognitive task managing model, using the set of training data; process, using the cognitive task managing model, a set of operational data associated with the user; in response to receiving a set of processed operational data, generate a task forecast for the user; determine, based on the task forecast, an optimal task for the user; and modifying a set of graphical elements within the GUI to notify the user of the optimal task.
8. The computer program product of claim 7, wherein the cognitive task managing model employs a Micro Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (msARIMA).
9. The computer program product of claim 7, wherein the collaborative messaging data includes email, text message, instant messaging, collaborative platform communications, and audio communications.
10. The computer program product of claim 7, wherein the application activity data includes applications associated with the user that are in use at the particular time.
11. The computer program product of claim 7, wherein the scheduled activity data includes calendar entries, program schedules, and historical information associated with the user at the particular time.
12. The computer program product of claim 9, wherein modifying a set of graphical elements within the GUI includes initiating a chat bot to remind the user of the optimal task, wherein the chat bot presents, to the user, an interactive link, via the GUI, that directs the user to a set of resources needed for the optimal task.
13. A system for modifying a graphical user interface (GUI) according to cognitively forecasted tasks, comprising: a memory with program instructions stored thereon; and a processor in communication with the memory, wherein the program instructions are executable by the processor to cause the system to: collect a set of training data for a cognitive task managing model, the set of training data associated with a user, wherein the set of training data includes a plurality of univariate time series datasets, and wherein each univariate time series dataset includes collaborative messaging data, application activity data, and scheduled activity data for the user at a particular time; train the cognitive task managing model, using the set of training data; process, using the cognitive task managing model, a set of operational data associated with the user; in response to receiving a set of processed operational data, generate a task forecast for the user; determine, based on the task forecast, an optimal task for the user; and modifying a set of graphical elements within the GUI to notify the user of the optimal task.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the cognitive task managing model employs a Micro Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (msARIMA).
