PROCESS MONITORING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for remotely monitoring a mine or mineral processing plant is provided. The system includes: a plurality of data sources at a mine or remote mineral processing plant site, the data sources including real-time (or near real time) data sources; a data assimilation node at the mine or remote mineral processing plant site, configured to assimilate data from the plurality of data sources as it is received; and a server, located remotely from the mine or remote mineral processing plant site. The server is configured to receive the assimilated data at or near real time, and transform the data into measure sets, each measure set relating to a state of the plant at the corresponding period of time, and comprising the data relating to that point of time and historical data for data points in which data does not exist, or only partially exists, for that period.

<claims>
1. A system for remotely monitoring a mine or mineral processing plant, the system including: a plurality of data sources at a remote mine or mineral processing plant site, the data sources including real-time (or near real time) data sources; a data assimilation node at the remote mine or mineral processing plant site, configured to assimilate data from the plurality of data sources as it is received; and a server, located remotely from the mine or remote mineral processing plant site, the server configured to receive the assimilated data at or near real time, and transform the data into measure sets, each measure set relating to a state of the plant at the corresponding period of time, and comprising the data relating to that point of time and historical data for data points in which data does not exist, or only partially exists, for that period of time.
2. The system of claim 1 , wherein the data includes temporal and non-temporal data.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the temporal data is stored in a historian associated with the server, and the non-temporal data stored in a relational database associated with the server.
4. The system of claim 1 , wherein the data includes one or more of: process control data, historian data, distributed control data, delay accounting data, dispatch/fleet data, laboratory information, and operator log sheets or maintenance records.
5. The system of claim 1 , wherein at least part of the data is captured using sensors associated with mineral processing equipment.
6. The system of claim 1 , wherein the data assimilation node is a physical device located within a network of the remote mine or mineral processing plant site.
7. The system of claim 1 , wherein the data assimilation node is configured to transmit data to the server securely using a virtual private network (VPN).
8. The system of claim 1 , wherein the data assimilation node is configured to transmit data to the server at regular intervals.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the data assimilation node buffers the data prior to transmission, and the transmission interval is about 1 minute or less.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the measure set is defined for a period corresponding to the interval of the data assimilation node.
1 1 . The system of claim 1 , wherein the measure set may comprise new data received for the period of time, and historical data for data points in which new data was not provided (or only partially provided) for the period of time.
12. The system of claim 1 1 , wherein the historical data comprises a duplicate data point, corresponding to the last known data point for that data source.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the duplicate data point includes meta-data indicating the age of the data point.
14. The system of claim 1 , wherein analysis is performed on each measure set
independently as it is generated.
15. The system of claim 14, further configured to generate a model, wherein analysis of the measure set is performed with reference to the model.
16. The system of claim 14, configured to send a notification based upon the analysis.
17. The system of claim 16, configured to send a notification if the result of the analysis is above or below a threshold, wherein the threshold is defined according to a relationship of a plurality of variables.
18. The system of claim 1 , further including predictive analytics to determine site efficiency, and to identify potential measures to increase plant efficiency, based upon the measure sets.
19. The system of claim 1 , further configured to generate dashboards based upon the measure sets and/or the received data.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein the dashboards are displayed on screens in control rooms, to enable remote productivity supervisors to monitor the site(s).
21 . The system of claim 19, wherein the dashboards include dynamic graphing to enable relationships between variables to be evaluated and highlighted.
22. The system of claim 19, wherein the dashboards are interactive, and are configurable to display data or variables based upon input from the user.
23. The system of claim 1 , configured to monitor changes in data according to one or more templates or models, wherein users may generate a template or model defining operating characteristics, wherein changes are determined according to the template or model.
24. The system of claim 1 , configured to monitor a plurality of sites, using a plurality of data assimilation nodes coupled to the single server.
25. The system of claim 24, including a data mart for each of the plurality of sites to provide clear segregation of sites.
26. A method for remotely monitoring a mine or mineral processing plant, the method including: receiving data, from a plurality of data sources at a remote mine or mineral processing plant site, the data sources including real-time (or near real time) data sources; assimilating the data from the plurality of data sources at a data assimilation node at the remote mine or mineral processing plant site as the data is received; and receiving, at a server, located remotely from the remote mine or mineral processing plant site, the assimilated data at or near real time, and transforming the received data into measure sets, each measure set relating to a state of the plant at the corresponding period of time, and comprising the data relating to that point of time and historical data for data points in which data does not exist, or only partially exists, for that interval.
