GENERATING IMAGE CAPTURE CONFIGURATIONS AND COMPOSITIONS
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for image analysis and configuration modification are provided. A first context of a camera device is determined, where the first context includes a current location of the camera device. A plurality of prior images is identified based on the first context, where each of the plurality of prior images was captured within a predefined distance from the current location of the camera device. Further, a respective popularity score is generated for each of the plurality of prior images, based on one or more social media networks. Finally, a first set of configuration parameters is generated for the camera device, based at least in part on (i) a degree of difference between the first context and a second context associated with a first prior image of the plurality of prior images, and (ii) a first popularity score of the first prior image.
