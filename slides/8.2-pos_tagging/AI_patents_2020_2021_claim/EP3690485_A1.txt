USER AUTHENTICATION USING MM-WAVE SENSOR FOR AUTOMOTIVE RADAR SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
In an embodiment, a method for authenticating a user of a car includes: transmitting a plurality of radiation pulses through a predetermined portion of a surface of the car towards a portion of a hand of the user using a millimeter-wave radar; receiving a reflected signal from the portion of the hand using the millimeter-wave radar; generating a fingerprint signature based on the reflected signal; comparing the fingerprint signature to a database of authorized fingerprint signatures; and authorizing the user based on whether the fingerprint signature matches an authorized fingerprint signature of the database of authorized fingerprint signatures.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for authenticating a user of a car, the method comprising: transmitting a plurality of radiation pulses through a predetermined portion of a surface of the car towards a portion of a hand of the user using a millimeter-wave radar; receiving a reflected signal from the portion of the hand using the millimeter-wave radar; generating a fingerprint signature based on the reflected signal; comparing the fingerprint signature to a database of authorized fingerprint signatures; and authorizing the user based on whether the fingerprint signature matches an authorized fingerprint signature of the database of authorized fingerprint signatures.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the predetermined portion of the surface of the car comprises a surface of a handle of the car.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the reflected signal comprises the reflected signal from a portion of a finger while the finger touches the predetermined portion of the surface of the car.
4. The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein the predetermined portion of the surface of the car comprises a surface of a steering wheel of the car.
5. The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein the predetermined portion of the surface of the car comprises a portion of a scanning plaque.
6. The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein the portion of the hand of the user comprises a portion of a palm of the hand.
7. The method of any of the preceding claims, further comprising detecting a proximity of the user to the car, wherein transmitting the plurality of radiation pulses comprises transmitting the plurality of radiation pulses after detecting the proximity of the user.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein detecting the proximity of the user to the car comprises detecting the proximity of the user using the millimeter-wave radar.
9. The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein each of the plurality of radiation pulses comprises a linear chirp.
10. The method of any of the preceding claims, further comprising adding an authorized fingerprint signature to the database of authorized fingerprint signatures by: scanning a fingerprint with a smartphone; and sending the scanned fingerprint to the database of authorized fingerprint signatures.
11. The method of any of the preceding claims, further comprising, after determining that the fingerprint signature matches an authorized fingerprint signature of the database of authorized fingerprint signatures,
detecting a gesture of a finger using the millimeter-wave radar;
generating a gesture signature based on the detected gesture; and
comparing the gesture signature to a predetermined authorized gesture signature, wherein authorizing the user is further based on whether the gesture signature matches the predetermined authorized gesture signature.
12. A millimeter-wave radar comprising: two transmitting antennas configured to transmit a plurality of radiation pulses through a predetermined portion of a surface of a car; two receiving antennas configured to receive a reflected signal corresponding to the transmitted plurality of radiation pulses; and a processor configured to: generate a fingerprint signature based on the reflected signal, compare the generated fingerprint signature to a database of authorized fingerprint signatures, and authorize access to the car based on whether the fingerprint signature matches an authorized fingerprint signature of the database of authorized fingerprint signatures.
13. The millimeter-wave radar of claim 12, wherein the two receiving antennas are misaligned along a first axis, and wherein the two transmitting antennas are aligned along the first axis.
14. A millimeter-wave radar system comprising: a first millimeter-wave radar comprising: a first transmitting antenna configured to generate a plurality of radiation pulses through a portion of a handle of a car, a first receiving antenna configured to receive a first reflected signal corresponding to the plurality of radiation pulses transmitted by the first transmitted antenna; a first processor configured to: generate a fingerprint signature based on the first reflected signal, compare the generated fingerprint signature to a database of authorized fingerprint signatures, and authorize access to the car based on whether the fingerprint signature matches an authorized fingerprint signature of the database of authorized fingerprint signatures; and a second millimeter-wave radar comprising: two transmitting antennas configured to generate a plurality of radiation pulses through a predetermined portion of a steering wheel of the car, two receiving antennas configured to receive a second reflected signal corresponding to the plurality of radiation pulses transmitted by the two transmitting antennas; and a second processor configured to: generate a gesture signature based on the second reflected signal, compare the generated gesture signature to a predetermined authorized gesture signature, and start an engine of the car based on whether the gesture signature matches the predetermined authorized gesture signature.
15. The millimeter-wave radar system of claim 14, wherein the first processor and the second processor are the same processor.
