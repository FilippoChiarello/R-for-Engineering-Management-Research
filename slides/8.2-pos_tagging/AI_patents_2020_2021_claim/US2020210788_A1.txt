DETERMINING WHETHER IMAGE DATA IS WITHIN A PREDETERMINED RANGE THAT IMAGE ANALYSIS SOFTWARE IS CONFIGURED TO ANALYZE
</title>

<abstract>
A system for determining whether image data is within a predetermined range that image analysis software is configured to analyze. The system includes a camera and an electronic processor. The electronic processor is configured to receive the image data from the camera and generate a prediction regarding the image data and a confidence value associated with the prediction. The electronic processor is also configured to perturb the image data using a perturbation value and generate a prediction regarding the perturbed image data and a confidence value associated with the prediction. The electronic processor is further configured to compare the confidence values and disable autonomous functionality of a vehicle when the difference between the confidence value associated with the prediction regarding the image data and the confidence value associated with the prediction regarding the image data is less than a predetermined threshold value.
