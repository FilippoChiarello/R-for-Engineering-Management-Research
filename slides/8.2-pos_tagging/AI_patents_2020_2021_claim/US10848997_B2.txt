<title>
Systems and methods for hybrid wireless communication network
</title>

<abstract>
A wireless communications system includes a feedback processing unit for analyzing captured bandwidth data from a remote radio head, and a problem-type processor in operable communication with the feedback processing unit. The problem-type processor is configured to (i) analyze the captured bandwidth data to determine whether the captured bandwidth data presents one of a computational polynomial time problem and a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem, and (ii) transmit problem-specific data based on the determination. The system further includes a communications processor in operable communication with the problem-type processor. The communications processor is configured to process polynomial time problem data from the transmitted problem-specific data. The system further includes a quantum computer in operable communication with the problem-type processor. The quantum computer is configured to process NP-hard problem data received from the transmitted problem-specific data.
