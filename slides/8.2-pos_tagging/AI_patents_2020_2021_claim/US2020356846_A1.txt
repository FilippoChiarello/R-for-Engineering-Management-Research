<title>
PREDICTION OF HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES AND RECOMMENDATION OF INTERVENTIONS USING DEEP LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
A system includes first, second and third input data sets. The first input data set includes demographic information characterizing a patient. The second and third input data sets characterize a healthcare treatment history of the patient. A neural network includes first, second and third neural subnetworks. The first neural subnetwork is configured to process the first input data set to produce a first output data set. The second neural subnetwork is configured to process the second input data set to produce a second output data set. The third neural subnetwork is configured to process the third input data set to produce a third output data set. An autoencoder layer has an input layer comprising the first, second and third output data sets and is configured to process the first, second and third output data sets to produce a secondary output data set.
