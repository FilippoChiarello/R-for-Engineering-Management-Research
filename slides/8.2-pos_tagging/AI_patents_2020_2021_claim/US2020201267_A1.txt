<title>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ARTIFICALLY INTELLIGENT MODEL-BASED CONTROL OF DYNAMIC PROCESSES USING PROBABILISTIC AGENTS
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for controlling a process such as an oil production process is disclosed. The system comprises multiple intelligent agents for processing data received from a plurality sensors deployed in a job site of an oil well, and applies a probabilistic model for evaluating risk and recommending appropriate control action to the process.

<claims>
The embodiments of the invention for which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows:
1. A method for controlling a process comprising: receiving real time process data generated from the process; comparing against a predictive objective function and/or a historical mean and/or a predicted operational envelope and/or a predetermined static function for establishing any deviation from normal operation; applying probabilistic modeling at a status agent for classifying the source and likely cause of the deviation; prioritizing actuation of at least one or more diagnostic agents related to causality of the deviation at a supervisory manager; communicating the results of the diagnostic agents to the supervisory manager; modifying the probabilistic model of the status agent from the results from the one or more diagnostic agents; and applying a probabilistic model at a control agent for evaluating risk and recommending and initiating an appropriate control action to the process.
2. A method of controlling a process comprising: comparing real time data to statistical and/or historical profiles of the process or a simulated profile of the process, taking into account operational variance and thereby identifying deviations; tracking the progress and the specific states of the process at a status agent and classifying probable diagnostic agents relevant to the deviations; and under the management of an AI Manager, triggering the appropriate diagnostic agents with causal process-specific PGNs for identifying probable causes for the deviation and their likelihood, and receiving the probabilistic diagnoses; comparing the probabilistic diagnoses of the various diagnostic agents and updating the Status Agent of the diagnosis of high certainty, or if sufficiently uncertain to differentiate a likely cause, initiating additional tests; and assessing opportunity and/or risk of control action at a control agent based on the probability of one or more diagnoses and recommending a control action to the process based on the opportunity/risk analysis.
3. A system for controlling a process in response to data collected from a plurality of sensors, said system comprising: a status agent for monitoring the status of the system based on data collected from the sensors; at least one diagnostic agent for diagnosing at least a portion of the system and collecting diagnostic data from the sensors to identify deviation from normal operation; a control agent for performing control actions to the process; and a supervisory manager coupling to the status agent, the at least one diagnostic agent and the control agent for: receiving real time process data generated from the process; comparing against a predictive objective function and/or a historical mean and/or a predicted operational envelope and/or a predetermined static function for establishing any deviation from normal operation; applying probabilistic modeling at the status agent for classifying the source and likely cause of the deviation; prioritizing actuation of the at least one diagnostic agent related to causality of the deviation; modifying the probabilistic model of the status agent from the results from the at least one diagnostic agent; and applying a probabilistic model at a control agent for evaluating risk and recommending appropriate control action to the process.
