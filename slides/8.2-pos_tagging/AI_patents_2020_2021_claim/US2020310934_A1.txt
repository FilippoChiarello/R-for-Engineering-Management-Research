INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEM, SERVER APPARATUS, INFORMATION PROCESSING APPARATUS, CONTROL METHODS OF THE SAME, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
A server apparatus collects, from a plurality of information processing apparatuses, time series information indicating a change over time in settings and a state of each information processing apparatus, and error information indicating an error that has occurred in each information processing apparatus, generates learning data including the collected information, and generates a diagnostic model, which is a trained model for a malfunction diagnosis in the information processing apparatus, through learning based on the generated learning data. The information processing apparatus obtains the diagnostic model from the server apparatus, outputs a diagnosis result indicating a likelihood that an error will occur in the information processing apparatus by collecting information necessary for the malfunction diagnosis within the information processing apparatus and executing the malfunction diagnosis using the collected information and the obtained diagnostic model.
