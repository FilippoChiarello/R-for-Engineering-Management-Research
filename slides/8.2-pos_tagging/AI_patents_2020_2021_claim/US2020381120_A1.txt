<title>
IMPLANT IDENTIFICATION
</title>

<abstract>
An example system includes an image capture portion to provide an image of a medical implant; an identification portion coupled to the image capture portion; and a determination portion to facilitate identification of the medical implant, the determination portion including at least one of (a) a crowd source portion to survey a set of users, wherein results of the survey are provided to the identification portion; (b) a decision-based portion to perform decisions based on features of the image of the medical implant and to provide results of the decisions to the identification portion; or (c) a database-based portion to select information from a database of information related to medical implants, the selected information being determined to correspond to the image of the medical implant, wherein the selected information is to be provided to the identification portion.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system, comprising: an image capture portion to provide an image of a medical implant; an identification portion coupled to the image capture portion; and a determination portion to facilitate identification of the medical implant, the determination portion including at least one of: (a) a crowd source portion to survey a set of users, wherein results of the survey are provided to the identification portion; (b) a decision-based portion to perform decisions based on features of the image of the medical implant and to provide results of the decisions to the identification portion; or (c) a database-based portion to select information from a database of information related to medical implants, the selected information being determined to correspond to the image of the medical implant, wherein the selected information is to be provided to the identification portion.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the identification portion is provided to facilitate identification of a tool associate with the medical implant based on identification of the medical implant by the identification portion.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the crowd source portion receives votes or comments from the set of users.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the crowd source portion provides a single candidate implant identification or multiple candidate implant identifications.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the crowd source portion provides a reward to one or more members of the set of users based on survey input.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the set of user of the crowd source portion is limited to professionals in a medical or medical device community.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the results provided by the decision-based portion include at least one candidate identity of the medical implant and a corresponding confidence level.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the confidence level is based on at least one of a number of matches to similar images in a database or a number of matching points of reference.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the database of information of the database-based portion includes images of medical implants.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the database-based portion includes an artificial intelligence component to generate synthetic images to be added to the database of information.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the image capture portion includes at least one of x-ray, digital x-ray, computed radiography (CR), digital radiography (DR), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), or ultrasound.
12. A method, comprising: capturing image of a medical implant; uploading the image to an identification system; and determining candidate identities of the medical implant, wherein determining the candidate identities includes at least one of the following: (a) performing a crowd-source based identification, comprising conducting a survey of a set of users, wherein results of the survey are provided to the identification portion; (b) performing a decision-based identification, comprising making decisions based on features of the image of the medical implant and providing results of the decisions to the identification portion; or (c) performing a database-based identification, comprising selecting information from a database of information related to medical implants, the selected information being determined to correspond to the image of the medical implant, wherein the selected information is to be provided to the identification portion.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising: using the identification system to facilitate identification of a tool associated with the medical implant based on determining the candidate identities.
14. The method of claim 12, wherein performing the crowd-source based identification includes receiving votes or comments from the set of users.
15. The method of claim 12, further comprising: providing a reward to one or more members of the set of users based on survey input in the crowd-source based identification.
16. The method of claim 12, wherein the set of user in the crowd-source based identification is limited to professionals in a medical or medical device community.
17. The method of claim 12, wherein the results from the decision-based identification include at least one candidate identity of the medical implant and a corresponding confidence level.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the confidence level is based on at least one of a number of matches to similar images in a database or a number of matching points of reference.
19. The method of claim 1, wherein the database of information used in the database-based identification includes images of medical implants.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein performing the database-based identification includes executing an artificial intelligence component to generate synthetic images to be added to the database of information.
