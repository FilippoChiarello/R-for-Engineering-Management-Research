<title>
REMOTE NUDGING/HEAT TRIGGER APPROACH TO ASSESS SEDATION LEVEL
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to sedation assessment. In order to facilitate sedation assessment in an environment of an imaging system, a sedation assessment system is provided. The sedation assessment system comprises at least one stimulus generator, a controlling device, at least one sensing device, and a sedation determination device. The controlling device is configured to generate at least one control signal including a first control signal and/or a second control signal. The at least one stimulus generator comprises a remote haptic device configured to induce, from a distance, a haptic sensation at a first impact region on a patient's skin in response to the first control signal. Additionally or alternatively, the at least one stimulus generator comprises a heating and/or cooling device attachable to a second impact region on a patient's skin and configured to heat or cool the second impact region for inducing a pain sensation in response to the second control signal. The at least one sensing device is configured to detect a patient reaction in response to the haptic sensation and/or the pain sensation. The sedation determination device is configured to determine, based on the detected patient reaction, a sedation level of the patient.

wherein the remote haptic device comprises at least one of the following transmitters: i) a mid-air acoustic transmitter; ii) mid-air ultrasound haptic transmitter; iii) an air nozzle; iv) an electromagnetic wave transmitter; v) an electric transmitter; vi) a magnetic transmitter; vii) a radio-frequency transmitter; and viii) a superconducting transmitter.
4. Sedation assessment system according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein the remote haptic device is configured to cause a change in temperature for the haptic sensation.
5. Sedation assessment system according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein the at least one sensing device is configured to detect at least one of the following patient reactions: i) a movement of a body part with the first and/or second impact region; ii) a change in a facial gesture of the patient; iii) a change in a measured vital sign; iv) a muscle response associated with the body part with the impact region; and v) a nerve response associated with the body part with the impact region.
6. Sedation assessment system according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein the at least one sensing device comprises an electromyography, EMG, sensor capable of detecting an EMG signal indicative of a muscle response associated with a body part with the first and/or second impact region;
wherein the sedation determination device is configured to extract an electromyography signal pattern associated with the muscle for the body part with the first and/or second impact region from a database; and

wherein the sedation assessment system is configured to determine a sedation level of the patient; and
wherein the control logic is configured to determine, based on the determined sedation level, whether to continue the scan protocol and/or to modify or adapt the scan protocol to a preferred condition matching to the determined sedation level of the patient.
12. Medical imaging system according to claim 11,
wherein the medical imaging apparatus is any one of: i) an X-ray imaging apparatus; ii) a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus; iii) a positron-emission tomography, PET, imaging apparatus; iv) a single-photon emission computed tomography, SPECT, imaging apparatus; v) a computed tomography, CT, imaging apparatus; vi) an ultrasound imaging apparatus; and vii) an optical imaging apparatus.
