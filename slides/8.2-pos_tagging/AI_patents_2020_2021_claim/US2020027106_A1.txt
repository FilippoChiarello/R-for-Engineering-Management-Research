SWEEPSTAKES CAMPAIGN SYSTEM AND USES THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to sweepstakes campaign system wherein consumers are given a clue to find a consumer good in a retail store. The consumer locates the good and places the good within the field of view of a camera of a mobile device or takes a picture of the good with the camera on the mobile device. The mobile device or a server can extract an object from the field of view or from the image and determine if the extracted object is a good and determine whether the good is correct. If the consumer has located the correct good, the consumer will be provided with the next reward clue and either a message or a good clue. The sweepstakes campaign can conclude with one or more winners being provided the location(s) or method of obtaining a reward.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving one or more clues related to a consumer good; transmitting the one or more clues to one or more consumer mobile devices; in response to transmitting the one or more clues, receiving, from at least one of the one or more consumer mobile devices, an image and metadata associated with the image; determining that the image is a solution to the one or more clues; and providing another clue to the at least one of the one or more consumer devices.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein determining that the image is a solution to the one or more clues comprises determining an object present in the image.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: determining that the image is a solution to the one or more clues that the object matches a reference object, wherein the reference object represents the solution to the clue.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising generating a three dimensional representation of the object.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein determining that the image is a solution to the one or more clues that the object matches a reference object comprises determining that the three dimensional representation of the object matches a three dimensional reference object.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the three dimensional representation of the object is determined to match the three dimensional reference object using a machine learning model.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the machine learning model comprises one or more of a support vector machine, a k-nearest neighbor algorithm, a neural network, or a convolutional neural network.
8. A sweepstakes campaign system comprising: a gaming administrator device, configured to: receive one or more clues related to a consumer good; transmit the one or more clues to one or more consumer mobile devices; in response to transmitting the one or more clues, receive, from at least one of the one or more consumer mobile devices, an image and metadata associated with the image; determine that the image is a solution to the one or more clues; and provide another clue to the at least one of the one or more consumer devices; and an application installed on a consumer mobile device configured to: receive the one or more clues; capture the image of the consumer good; capture the metadata; and transmit the image and the metadata to the gaming administrator device.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the gaming administrator device is configured to determine that the image is a solution to the one or more clues by determining an object present in the image.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the gaming administrator device is further configured to: determine that the image is a solution to the one or more clues that the object matches a reference object, wherein the reference object represents the solution to the clue.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the gaming administrator device is further configured to: generate a three dimensional representation of the object.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the gaming administrator device is configured to determine that the image is a solution to the one or more clues that the object matches a reference object by determining that the three dimensional representation of the object matches a three dimensional reference object.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the gaming administrator device determines that the three dimensional representation of the object matches the three dimensional reference object using a machine learning model.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the machine learning model comprises one or more of a support vector machine, a k-nearest neighbor algorithm, a neural network, or a convolutional neural network.
15. A method comprising: receiving, by a computing device, metadata associated with an image captured by the computing device; determining, based on a symmetric key, an identifier for the image; generating, based on the metadata associated with the image and the identifier, a watermarked image; and sending, to a verification subsystem, the watermarked image, wherein the verification subsystem determines, based on the watermarked image, that the metadata identifies the computing device.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the metadata comprises one or more of position, time, camera orientation, mobile device velocity, shake/rattle/roll (SRR) data, or audio data.
17. The method of claim 15, further comprising capturing, by the computing device, the image using a camera in communication with the computing device.
18. The method of claim 15, wherein the identifier comprises one or more of the symmetric key or a concatenation of the symmetric key and at least a portion of the metadata.
19. The method of claim 15, further comprising: sending, to the verification subsystem, an identifier associated with the computing device.
20. The method of claim 15, further comprising: receiving one or more clues related to a consumer good, wherein the watermarked image is associated with the one or more clues; receiving an indication that the watermarked image is a solution to the one or more clues, wherein the indication is received in response to the verification subsystem determining, based on an object present in the watermarked image, that the watermarked image is the solution to the one or more clues; and receiving another clue related to the consumer good.
