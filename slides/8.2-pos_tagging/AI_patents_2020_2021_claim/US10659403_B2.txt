<title>
Systems and methods for navigating nodes in channel based chatbots using natural language understanding
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosed systems and methods join a user to a primary communication channel that is associated with an automated human interface module. The automated human interface module includes a plurality of nodes. A message including a text communication is posted by the user and sent to a decision module associated with a plurality of classifiers. The decision module is configured to identify a node that best matches the text communication in accordance with the plurality of classifiers. Each respective classifier produces a respective classifier result thereby producing a plurality of classifier results. Each respective classifier result identifies a respective node of the plurality of nodes best matching the text communication. The plurality of classifier results is collectively considered, and the node best matching the text communication is identified and the text communication is sent to the identified node.
