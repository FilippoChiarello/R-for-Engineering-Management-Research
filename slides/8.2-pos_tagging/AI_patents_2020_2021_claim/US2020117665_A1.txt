<title>
PLATFORM MANAGEMENT OF INTEGRATED ACCESS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATELY-ACCESSIBLE DATASETS UTILIZING FEDERATED QUERY GENERATION AND QUERY SCHEMA REWRITING OPTIMIZATION
</title>

<abstract>
Various techniques are described for platform management of integrated access of public and privately-accessible datasets utilizing federated query generation and query schema rewriting optimization, including receiving at a dataset access platform a query formatted according to a first data schema, generating a copy of the query, saving the query and the copy to a datastore, parsing the copy of the query in the first schema using an inference engine, determining whether the query comprises data associated with an access control condition associated with accessing the dataset, the access control condition being configured to indicate whether the query is permitted to access the dataset, and rewriting, using a proxy server, the copy of the query in a second schema by converting the copy of the query into a triple associated with the query and another triple associated with the access control condition.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system comprising: a memory including executable instructions; and a processor configured to execute the instructions to: receive at a dataset access platform a query formatted using a first schema including a structured relational-based format, the query comprising data associated with a request to access a dataset; generate a copy of the query; save the query and the copy to a data store, the query being identified as a master; parse the copy of the query in the first schema, the parsing being performed by an inference engine to infer the first schema and an attribute associated with the query, and to generate a graph having one or more data links between the dataset and another dataset accessible by the dataset access platform; determine, during the parsing, whether the query comprises other data associated with an access control condition associated with accessing the dataset, the access control condition being configured to indicate whether the query is configured to provide authentication data to access the dataset; and rewrite, using a proxy server, the copy of the query in a second schema including a triples-based format, if the access control condition indicates the query is configured to authenticate access to the dataset, the rewriting comprising converting, using a framework, the copy of the query into a triple associated with the query and another triple associated with the other data, the triple and the another triple being included in a rewritten query in the second schema including the triples-based format directed to one or more endpoints associated with the dataset access platform to retrieve query results from a target database configured to store the dataset as graph-based data.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: create a triple file associated with the triple and the another triple, the triple file also including other data associated with a graph, the graph being associated with the query and the attribute.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: create a triple file associated with the triple and the another triple, the triple file also being configured to indicate one or more property paths associated with the dataset and linked data associated with the dataset.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the query comprises a pre-signed uniform resource locator address.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the query comprises a pre-signed uniform resource indicator.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the proxy server is configured to convert the query from the first schema to the second schema using a protocol, the protocol being SPARQL.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: rewrite the copy of the query using resource description framework to model one or more data relationships of the query.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the query comprises a publicly-accessible dataset and a privately accessible dataset, the privately-accessible dataset being configured to permit access if the access control condition is equal to another condition
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the another condition is configured to be controlled by the privately-accessible dataset.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: rewrite the copy of the query to generate a federated query that is configured to access one or more endpoints of the dataset access platform and one or more database engines associated with the dataset.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the attribute, during inference, indicates the query does not include an access control condition configured to access the dataset.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein the attribute, during inference, indicates the dataset is privately-accessible and the access control condition, is configured to access the dataset.
13. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: federate the copy of the query rewritten in the second schema, the federated query comprising a triple pattern generated using the second schema and other data associated with accessing one or more access-controlled datasets, the one or more access-controlled datasets being stored on one or more data networks.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein each of the one or more endpoints is configured to access at least one of the one or more data networks.
15. The system of claim 13, wherein each of the one or more endpoints is configured to access at least one of the one or more access-controlled datasets.
16. The system of claim 1, wherein the first schema including the structured relational-based format includes SQL query data.
17. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: parse the query into a data structure including an abstract syntax tree associated with a target query language.
