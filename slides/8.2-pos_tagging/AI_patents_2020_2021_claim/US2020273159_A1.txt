PROGRAMMABLE PRODUCT ASSESSOR
</title>

<abstract>
A system includes a programmable assessor and a remote computer. The programmable assessor includes an assessment chamber, which includes an assessment platform and a sensor arranged to sense characteristics of a product on the assessment platform, as well as a processor coupled to the sensor and an input coupled to the processor. The remote computer includes a remote processor. The sensor is configured to sense characteristics of first and second versions of the product. The input is configured to receive a classification of the first and second versions of the product. The programmable assessor is configured to provide the sensed characteristics and classification of the first and second versions of the product to the remote processor. The remote processor is configured to generate an assessment program based on the sensed characteristics and classification of the first and second versions of the product, and to provide the generated assessment program to the programmable assessor. The processor of the programmable assessor is configured to execute the generated assessment program to assess and sort additional versions of the product.
