<title>
NOVEL WORKFLOW FOR EPIGENETIC-BASED DIAGNOSTICS OF CANCER
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided for diagnosing cancer by using promoter methylation as an indicator of interest. Key promoter regions of interest are first identified via supervised or unsupervised machine learning applied to the Cancer Genome Atlas via a silico predictive tool. After this, a specially-designed assay is used to detect the presence of these hyper-methylated regions of interest and provide a quantitative, fluorescent readout in order to generate clinical insight. In addition, special advances in material science and microfluidics are used to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. The workflow is then completed via integration into a smartphone application that provides the necessary data and helps streamline doctor-patient communication.

<claims>
1. A method for performing a liquid biopsy, the method comprising: contacting DNA probes with a sample of target ctDNA, the DNA probes comprising a graphene oxide (GO) interacting region and a target recognition region complementary to a target region of the target ctDNA based on biomarkers for identifying key CpG sites of the target ctDNA identified via a machine learning algorithm; contacting the sample of target ctDNA with a labeled methyl-binding domain protein (MBD); and determining ctDNA concentration and corresponding methylation levels of the target ctDNA based on fluorescence of the sample of target ctDNA; and monitoring the determined ctDNA concentration and corresponding methylation levels of the target ctDNA on a digital health platform.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning algorithm generates a model that uses clustering and logistic regression based on a training data set, and corroborates the model against a validation dataset to determine its diagnostic accuracy.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the machine learning algorithm comprises a Random Forest algorithm.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the machine learning algorithm comprises a LASSO regression algorithm.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more DNA probes further comprise a fluorescent dye.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more DNA probes comprise 10-150 base pairs.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the GO interacting region of the one or more DNA probes comprises a high Guanine-Cytosine content.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the MBD label comprises horse radish peroxidase (HRP) or green fluorescent protein (GFP).
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising pre-incubating the DNA probes with GO.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising contacting the sample of target ctDNA with an Exonuclease III solution.
11. The method of claim 1, further comprising contacting the sample of target ctDNA with a hydrogen peroxide and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid solution.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein monitoring the determined ctDNA concentration and corresponding methylation levels of the target ctDNA on a digital health platform is used to determine whether an individual is predisposed to at least one of carcinoma, sarcoma, neuroblastoma, cervical cancer, hepatocellular cancer, mesothelioma, glioblastoma, myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia, adenoma, adenocarcinoma, glioma, glioblastoma, retinoblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendrocytoma, meningioma, or melanoma.
13. The method of claim 1, further comprising assessing post-therapeutic effects of a medication by comparing the data indicative of the determined ctDNA concentration and corresponding methylation levels before and after a treatment using the medication.
14. A system for performing a liquid biopsy, the system comprising: non-transitory computer readable media having instructions that, when executed by a processor cause the processor to execute a machine learning algorithm to identify one or more biomarkers for identifying key CpG sites of a target ctDNA; a diagnostic cell-free protein-based system configured to determine ctDNA concentration and corresponding methylation levels of the target ctDNA based on measured fluorescence of a sample of target ctDNA in contact with DNA probes comprising a graphene oxide (GO) interacting region and a target recognition region complementary to a target region of the target ctDNA based on the identified biomarkers; and a digital health platform configured to monitor the determined ctDNA concentration and corresponding methylation levels of the target ctDNA.
