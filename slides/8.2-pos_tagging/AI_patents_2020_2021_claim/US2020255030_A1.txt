SENSING SYSTEM AND VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
A sensing system provided in a vehicle capable of running in an autonomous driving mode, includes: a LiDAR unit configured to acquire point group data indicating surrounding environment of the vehicle; and a LiDAR control module configured to identify information associated with a target object existing around the vehicle, based on the point group data acquired from the LiDAR unit. The LiDAR control module is configured to control the LiDAR unit so as to increase a scanning resolution of the LiDAR unit in a first angular area in a detection area of the LiDAR unit, wherein the first angular area is an area where the target object exists.
