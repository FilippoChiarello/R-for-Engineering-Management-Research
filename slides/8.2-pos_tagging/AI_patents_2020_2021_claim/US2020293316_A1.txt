COMPUTATIONAL MEMORY
</title>

<abstract>
A processing device includes an array of processing elements, each processing element including an arithmetic logic unit to perform an operation. The processing device further includes interconnections among the array of processing elements to provide direct communication among neighboring processing elements of the array of processing elements. A processing element of the array of processing elements may be connected to a first neighbor processing element that is immediately adjacent the processing element. The processing element may be further connected to a second neighbor processing element that is immediately adjacent the first neighbor processing element. A processing element of the array of processing elements may be connected to a neighbor processing element via an input selector to selectively take output of the neighbor processing element as input to the processing element. A computing device may include such processing devices in an arrangement of banks.

<claims>
1. A processing device comprising: an array of processing elements, each processing element including an arithmetic logic unit to perform an operation; interconnections among the array of processing elements to provide direct communication among neighboring processing elements of the array of processing elements wherein: a processing element of the array of processing elements is connected to a first neighbor processing element that is immediately adjacent the processing element; and the processing element is further connected to a second neighbor processing element that is immediately adjacent the first neighbor processing element.
2. The processing device of claim 1, wherein: the processing element is further connected to an opposite first neighbor processing element that is immediately adjacent the processing element on a side opposite the first neighbor processing element; and the processing element is further connected to an opposite second neighbor processing element that is immediately adjacent the opposite first neighbor processing element.
3. The processing device of claim 2, wherein the processing element is further connected to a third neighbor processing element that is immediately adjacent the second neighbor processing element.
4. The processing device of claim 3, wherein the processing element is further connected to an opposite third neighbor processing element that is immediately adjacent the opposite second neighbor processing element.
5. The processing device of claim 4, wherein each non-endmost processing element of the array of processing elements is connected to neighboring processing elements in a same relative manner as the processing element.
6. The processing device of claim 4, wherein the processing element includes a selector to select input to the processing element as one of: the first neighbor processing element, the opposite first neighbor processing element, the second neighbor processing element, the opposite second neighbor processing element, the third neighbor processing element, and the opposite third neighbor processing element.
7. The processing device of claim 6, wherein the selector comprises an unbalanced multiplexer arrangement.
8. The processing device of claim 1, wherein the processing element includes a selector to select input to the processing element as one of the neighboring processing elements.
9. The processing device of claim 8, wherein the selector includes a register to indicate which of the neighboring processing elements is selected as input.
10. The processing device of claim 1, further comprising: a controller connected to the array of processing elements, the controller to perform a rearrangement of data within the array of processing elements by controlling communication of the data through the interconnections among the array of processing elements.
11. The processing device of claim 10, further comprising: memory at the array of processing elements; wherein the controller is to control the array of processing elements to perform a single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) operation with data in the memory.
12. The processing device of claim 1, further comprising a plurality of the arrays of processing elements.
13. A computing device comprising a plurality of processing devices of claim 1 as an arrangement of banks.
14. A non-transitory machine-readable medium comprising executable instructions to: load a matrix of coefficients into an array of processing elements as serialized coefficients; load an input vector into the array of processing elements; and perform an operation with the matrix of coefficients and the input vector by: performing a parallel operation with the serialized coefficients in the array of processing elements and the input vector; accumulating a result vector; and rotating the input vector in the array of processing elements and repeating the performing of the parallel operation and the accumulating until the operation is complete; and when the operation is complete, outputting the result vector.
15. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 14, further comprising instructions to: connect an input of a processing element of the array of processing elements to an output of another processing element of the array of processing elements.
16. A processing device comprising: an array of processing elements, each processing element including an arithmetic logic unit to perform an operation; interconnections among the array of processing elements to provide direct communication among neighboring processing elements of the array of processing elements wherein: a processing element of the array of processing elements is connected to a neighbor processing element via an input selector to selectively take output of the neighbor processing element as input to the processing element.
17. The processing device of claim 16, wherein the input selector includes an unbalanced multiplexer arrangement.
18. The processing device of claim 16, wherein the processing element of the array of processing elements is connected to the neighbor processing element via an output selector to selectively provide output of the neighbor processing element.
