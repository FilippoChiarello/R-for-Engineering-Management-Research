</title>

<abstract>
An image identification apparatus includes an acquisition unit configured to acquire an input image, a classification unit configured to calculate a classification score of the input image based on a neural network having a weight coefficient in each layer determined to calculate the classification score indicating a degree of similarity between a training image and an image to be processed, an anomaly determination unit configured to calculate an anomaly score of the input image based on a function approximator constructed by machine learning based on the training image of correct answer, and an identification unit configured to classify the input image into a good image having a high degree of similarity to the training image of the correct answer or a bad image having low degree of similarity to the training image of correct answer based on the classification score and the anomaly score.
