<title>
One step removed shadow network
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method includes an operational network that communicates with an external network by opening a first transmission protocol socket. A data diode coupled to the operational network and a gateway enables the one-way transfer of all information received from the external network and transmitted by the operational network to the gateway such that no information travels from the gateway to the operational network or the external network. The gateway opens a second transmission protocol socket by mapping a sequence number to an acknowledgement number and increasing that mapped acknowledgement number by a value of one. A transmitter then transmits the acknowledgment to a remote network or a gateway.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: an operational network that communicates with an external network by opening a first transmission protocol socket; a data diode coupled to the operational network and a gateway that enables one-way transfer of all information received from the external network and transmitted by the operational network to the gateway such that no information travels from the gateway to the operational network and to the external network; the gateway simulates a handshake enabling the opening of a second transmission protocol socket by mapping a sequence number packet to an acknowledgment packet number such that the acknowledgement packet number is one larger than a value of the sequence number packet; and a transmitter that transmits the acknowledgment to a remote network.
2. The system of claim 1 wherein the data diode is directly connected to the gateway.
3. The system of claim 1 wherein a cathode of the data diode is directly connected to the gateway.
4. The system of claim 1 wherein the operational network comprises a firewall.
5. The system of claim 4 wherein the operational network comprises a core network.
6. The system of claim 1 wherein the operational network comprises a core network.
7. The system of claim 1 wherein the gateway responds to a change in a sliding-window flow control by a division of the data received into a plurality of packets that are separately transmitted appended to a sequentially increasing sequence number.
8. The system of claim 1 wherein the remote network comprises a replication of the operational network.
9. The system of claim 1 wherein the remote network comprises a replication of a portion of the operational network.
10. The system of claim 1 wherein the gateway comprises a device that connects the remote network to a physical external network and a simulated external network communication through a load balancer.
11. The system of claim 1 wherein the remote network comprises a replication of a portion of a simulation of the operational network.
12. The system of claim 1 wherein the gateway comprises a device that connects the remote network to a real and a simulated external network communication via a modification of a transmission protocol sequence number.
13. A non-transitory machine-readable medium encoded with machine-executable instructions, wherein execution of the machine-executable instructions is for: opening a first transmission protocol socket between an operational network and an external network; enabling a one-way transfer of all information received from the external network and transmitted by the operational network to a gateway such that no information travels from the gateway to the operational network or to the external network; simulating a handshake that enables the opening of a second transmission protocol socket by mapping a sequence number to an acknowledgment number with the acknowledgement number modified such that the acknowledgement number is one larger than the sequence number; and transmitting the acknowledgment to the gateway.
14. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 13 wherein the operational network comprises a firewall.
15. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 14 wherein the operational network comprises a core network.
16. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 13 wherein the operational network comprises a core network.
17. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 13 further comprising responding to a change in a sliding-window flow control by a division of data received into a plurality of packets that are sequentially transmitted with an appended sequentially increasing sequence number.
18. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 13 wherein the acknowledgement passes through a remote network that comprises a replication of the operational network.
19. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 13 wherein the acknowledgement passes through a remote network that comprises a replication of a portion of the operational network.
20. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 13 wherein the gateway comprises a device that connects a remote network to a physical external network and a simulated external network communication via a modification of a transmission protocol.
21. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 13 wherein the acknowledgement passes through a remote network that comprises a replication of a portion of a simulation of the operational network.
22. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 13, further comprising executing instructions connecting a remote network to a real and a simulated external network communication via a load balancer.
23. A method comprising: opening a first transmission protocol socket between an operational network and an external network; enabling a one-way transfer of all information received from the external network and transmitted by the operational network to a gateway such that no information travels from the gateway to the operational network or the external network; simulating a TCP handshake that enables the opening of a second transmission protocol socket by mapping a sequence number to an acknowledgement number such that the acknowledgment number is modified such that the acknowledgement number is incrementally larger than a value of the sequence number; and transmitting the acknowledgment to the gateway.
