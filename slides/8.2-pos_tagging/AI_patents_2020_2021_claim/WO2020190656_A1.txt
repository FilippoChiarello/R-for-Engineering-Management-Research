<abstract>
Methods and systems for provisioning resources for games executed by a cloud gaming system includes accessing online interactions of a plurality of users in relation to a game. The online interactions are processed to classify discussion features obtained from online social communications. A model is generated to predict game use, using the classified discussion features. The model is updated with online interactions received over time. Resources for the game are provisioned at a data center. The provisioning is done by accessing the model and identifying adjustments in the provisioning for an anticipated usage spike that is to occur by a plurality of users, based on current online interactions.

CLAIMS
1. A method for provisioning resources for games executed by a cloud gaming system, comprising,
accessing online interactions of a plurality of users in relation to a game, the online interactions relate to social topics that include the game, wherein online interactions are accessed from online social communications by one or more of said plurality of users; processing the online interactions to classify discussion features obtained from said online social communications;
generating a model of predicted game use using the classified discussion features, the model being updated over time based on the accessing of online interactions and processing of the online interactions; and
provisioning resources for the game at a data center, the provisioning includes accessing the model to identify adjustments in the provisioning of resources, the adjustments include increasing an amount of resources for the game at the data center when the model indicates, based on current online interactions, that an anticipated usage spike is to occur by said plurality of users.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the online social communications include in-game interactions or off-game interactions, the off-game interactions include social media interactions or other interactions provided outside of the game.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the social topics are identified using keywords within the online interactions.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein classifying discussion features includes,
performing keyword analysis of an online interaction generated by a user, to identify keywords relating to social topics;
identifying distribution of the keywords within the online interaction, the distribution of keywords used to define the discussion features;
determining an activity performed in the game by the user following the online interaction; and
classifying the discussion features based on the distribution of the keywords and the activity performed in the game, the classification used in determining usage spike for the game.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the online interactions are provided by the plurality of users prior to accessing the game, and the model is updated with the discussion features SONYP380.P identified from the online interactions and activity related to the game performed by the plurality of users following the online interactions.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein provisioning resources for the game includes identifying a geo location where the usage spike is to occur and provisioning the resources for the game at the data center associated with the geo location.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein provisioning resources for the game includes,
identifying specific sub-systems of the resources required at the data center for the anticipated usage spike; and
provisioning the specific sub-systems at the data center in proportion to the anticipated usage spike.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein resources are provisioned in accordance to a number of instances of the game to be executed, wherein the number of instances is in proportion to the anticipated usage spike.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein predicting game use for the game includes correlating a pattern of occurrence of the discussion features in the current online interactions with a corresponding pattern in the model, the pattern in the model used in mapping the discussion features to an output predicting game use.
10. A resource usage prediction engine executing on a cloud gaming system for provisioning resources for games, comprising:
an interaction analyzer configured to access online interactions from online social communications of a plurality of users and process the online interactions related to a game to classify discussion features obtained from said online social communications;
a model trainer configured to generate a model of predicted game use using the classified discussion features, the model trainer updating the model based on online interactions accessed and processed over time;
a usage spike predictor configured to access the model and predict game use using the classified discussion features of the model; and
a resource allocation agent configured to provision resources for the game at a data center, the resource allocation agent configured to access the model to identify adjustments in the provisioning of resources, wherein the adjustments identify increase in amount of resources for the game at the data center, when the model indicates likelihood of occurrence of anticipated usage spike, based on current online interactions. SONYP380.P
11. The resource usage prediction engine of claim 10, wherein the model trainer is configured to update the model using the current online interactions.
12. The resource usage prediction engine of claim 10, wherein the online social communications include in-line interactions and off-line interactions, the off-line interactions include social media interactions and other interactions provided outside of the game.
13. The resource usage prediction engine of claim 12, wherein the interaction analyzer is configured to obtain and process the in-line interactions and the off-line interactions to identify discussion features.
14. The resource usage prediction engine of claim 10, further includes a usage identifier configured to identify geo locations where the anticipated usage spikes occur and to generate a signal to the resource allocation agent to provision the resources at the identified geo locations.
15. The resource usage prediction engine of claim 14, wherein the usage identifier is further configured to identify specific sub-systems of resources within each of the geo locations that are to be provisioned in proportion to the anticipated usage spikes.
