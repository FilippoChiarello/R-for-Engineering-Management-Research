ACTION SELECTION DEVICE, COMPUTER READABLE MEDIUM, AND ACTION SELECTION METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An action selection device (10) includes an action selection unit (22). The action selection unit (22) acquires from a memory (30), an action list (31) in which a requirement recognition area is associated with each action of a plurality of actions, the requirement recognition area indicating an area for which recognition by a sensor is required. The action selection unit (22) acquires from a peripheral recognition device (53), a recognition area (53a) recognized by sensors (53-1) that the peripheral recognition device (53) has. The action selection unit (22) selects from the action list (31), an action associated with the requirement recognition area included in the recognition area (53a).
