DOMAIN ADAPTION
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a method and system that allows input mammography images to be converted between domains. More particularly, the present invention relates to converting mammography images from the image style common to one manufacturer of imaging equipment to the image style common to another manufacturer of imaging equipment. Aspects and/or embodiments seek to provide a method of converting input images from the format output by one imaging device into the format normally output by another imaging device. The imaging devices may differ in their manufacturer, model or configuration such that they produce different styles of image, even if presented with the same raw input data, due to the image processing used in the imaging device(s).

<claims>
1 . A computer-aided method of training a neural network to transfer mammography images between domains, the neural network operable to perform the steps of:
receiving a plurality of mammogram images in a first domain; receiving a plurality of mammogram images in a second domain; determining a first network to transfer one or more of the plurality of mammogram images in a first domain to a second domain to output transferred second domain images;
determining a second network to transfer one or more of the plurality of mammogram images in a second domain to a first domain to output transferred first domain images;
determining a discriminator network to output labels for each input image, the labels comprising being in the first domain, being in the second domain or being a generated image;
wherein the training of the neural network is performed by optimising a sum of losses.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein each of the first and/or second networks to transfer one or more of the plurality of images between domains comprises a paired encoder and decoder.
3. The method of any preceding claim wherein said optimising a sum of losses comprises optimising a sum of losses between at least a plurality of: each of the plurality of mammogram images in a first domain; each of the plurality of mammogram images in a second domain, each of the labels; each of the output transferred second domain images; and each of the output transferred second domain images.
4. The method of any preceding claim wherein the neural network is operable to receive at least one further plurality of mammogram images in one or more further domains and at least one further network to transfer one or more of the plurality of mammogram images in one of the domains to another of the domains to output transferred another of the domains' images.
5. The method of any preceding claim wherein the each of the losses making up the sum of the losses is weighted relative to each other of the losses making up the sum of the losses. 6. The method of any preceding claim where the training of the neural network is first done using low resolution image data then iteratively in one or more steps the resolution of the image data is increased as the neural network is trained.
7. The method of any preceding claim wherein the losses making up the sum of the losses includes any combination of: a breast mask loss; a consistency loss; a reconstruction loss; a vendor loss; and a GAN loss.
8. The method of any preceding claim wherein any of the first and/or second networks to transfer one of more of the plurality of images between domains comprises a generative network.
9. The method of any preceding claim where the first domain is a first vendor image style and the second domain is a second vendor image style. 10. A trained network to transfer one or more of the plurality of mammogram images in one domain to another domain, trained according to the method of any preceding claim.
