<title>
Systems and methods for embedding data in media content
</title>

<abstract>
An electronic device determines a first audio event of a first media content item and modifies the first media content item by superimposing a first set of data that corresponds to the first media content item over the first audio event. The first audio event has a first audio profile configured to be presented over a first channel for playback. The first set of data has a second audio profile configured to be presented over the first channel for playback. Playback of the second audio profile is configured to be masked by the first audio profile during playback of the first media content item. The electronic device transmits, to a second electronic device, the modified first media content item.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: at a first electronic device associated with a media-providing service, the first electronic device having one or more processors and memory storing instructions for execution by the one or more processors: determining a first audio event of a first media content item; modifying the first media content item by superimposing a first set of data that corresponds to the first media content item over the first audio event, wherein: the first audio event has a first audio profile configured to be presented over a first channel for playback, the first set of data has a second audio profile configured to be presented over the first channel for playback, and playback of the second audio profile is configured to be masked by the first audio profile during playback of the first media content item; and transmitting, to a second electronic device, the modified first media content item.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first channel is a left stereo channel or a right stereo channel.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein: the first audio profile is configured to be presented over the first channel and a second channel for playback, the second audio profile is configured to be presented over the first channel and the second channel for playback.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the first audio event is a first audio event of a plurality of audio events.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein a respective audio event of the plurality of audio events is a beat.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein the first set of data is encoded as a series of pulses superimposed over the plurality of audio events of the first media content item.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the first audio event is identified as an audio event in accordance with a determination that the first audio event occurs at an amplitude of the first media content item above a first threshold amplitude.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the first audio event is identified as an audio event using an algorithm that identifies periodically repeating patterns.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the first set of data includes at least one of timing information, a title of the first media content item, an artist of the first media content item, lyrics for the first media content item, or playlist information.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the first set of data is encoded as noise superimposed over the first media content item.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the first set of data is overlaid at a position in the first media content item that corresponds to the first audio event and for a predetermined time after the first audio event.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the first audio event has a first amplitude that is higher than a second amplitude of the first set of the data.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the first set of the data has a frequency profile that corresponds to a frequency profile of the first audio event.
14. The method of claim 1, including modifying the first media content item by superimposing a second set of data that corresponds to the first media content item over a second audio event.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein modifying the first media content item by superimposing the first set of data that corresponds to the first media content item over the first audio event comprises encoding the first set of data to an audio signal and superimposing the audio signal over the first audio profile of the first audio event.
16. A first electronic device comprising: one or more processors; and memory storing instructions for execution by the one or more processors, the instructions including instructions for: determining a first audio event of a first media content item; modifying the first media content item by superimposing a first set of data that corresponds to the first media content item over the first audio event, wherein: the first audio event has a first audio profile configured to be presented over a first channel for playback, the first set of data has a second audio profile configured to be presented over the first channel for playback, and playback of the second audio profile is configured to be masked by the first audio profile during playback of the first media content item; and transmitting, to a second electronic device, the modified first media content item.
17. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions, which when executed by an electronic device, cause the electronic device to: determine a first audio event of a first media content item; modify the first media content item by superimposing a first set of data that corresponds to the first media content item over the first audio event, wherein: the first audio event has a first audio profile configured to be presented over a first channel for playback, the first set of data has a second audio profile configured to be presented over the first channel for playback, and playback of the second audio profile is configured to be masked by the first audio profile during playback of the first media content item; and transmit, to a second electronic device, the modified first media content item.
