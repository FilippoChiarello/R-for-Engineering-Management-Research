<title>
Unauthorized communication detection reference deciding method, unauthorized communication detection reference deciding system, and non-transitory computer-readable recording medium storing a program
</title>

<abstract>
A reference message deciding method used in unauthorized communication detection. The deciding method includes: identifying, from information relating to an attack message on the onboard network system, a communication pattern indicating features related to change in data values or communication timing of an attack message; determining whether or not a message sent out onto the network matches a communication pattern identified in the identifying; and deciding a reference message used in determining whether or not the message sent out is an attack message, using determination results of the determining.

<claims>
1. An unauthorized communication detection reference deciding method used in unauthorized communication detection in an onboard network system that is executed by an information processing system including at least one memory, the onboard network system including a network and one or more electronic control units connected to the network, the reference message deciding method comprising: identifying, from information relating to a plurality of attack messages of the same type detected in the unauthorized communication detection, a communication pattern indicating features of the plurality of attack messages of the same type or, from information relating to a plurality of attack messages of different types in the unauthorized communication detection, a communication pattern indicating features of the plurality of attack messages of different types; determining, when at least two messages of the same type sent out onto the network have not been determined to be attack messages during a predetermined reception cycle, whether or not the at least two messages match a communication pattern identified in the identifying; and p1 deciding that one of the at least two messages determined not to match the communication pattern is to be used as a reference message for detecting the unauthorized communication during a predetermined next reception cycle, the reference message being used for calculation of data values or a reception time of a message.
2. The unauthorized communication detection reference deciding method according to claim 1, wherein, in the deciding, one of the at least two messages selected from the plurality of messages based on results of comparison between a planned reception time based on patterns relating to the reception time of each of multiple messages, and an actual reception time, is decided to be the reference message.
3. The unauthorized communication detection reference deciding method according to claim 1, wherein, in the identifying, a pattern relating to change in data values included in the plurality of messages sent out onto the network is identified as the communication pattern, and wherein, in the deciding, one of the at least two messages selected from the plurality of messages based on data values included in the plurality of messages is decided to be the reference message.
4. The unauthorized communication detection reference deciding method according to claim 3, wherein the pattern relating to change in the data value is a pattern relating to whether or not there is the data value included in a plurality of messages representing a data amount of the same type included in the plurality of messages, a pattern relating to rate of increase or decrease of a data amount included in the plurality of messages representing the data amount of the same type, or a pattern relating to difference or ratio between data values included in messages representing the data amount of the same type and data values included in messages representing a data amount of another type.
5. The unauthorized communication detection reference deciding method according to claim 1, wherein, further, in the deciding, in a case where a reference message cannot be decided since there is no message determined to not match the communication pattern in the determination results in the determining, the reference message is decided following a predetermined rule, without using the determination results of the determining.
6. The unauthorized communication detection reference deciding method according to claim 1, wherein, further, in the deciding, in a case where there are a plurality of messages determined to not match the communication pattern, one message selected from the plurality of messages determined to not match the communication pattern following a predetermined rule is decided to be the reference message.
7. The unauthorized communication detection reference deciding method according to claim 5, wherein the predetermined rule is a predetermined rule relating to transmission time or reception time, or to a data value, of the at least two messages that have been sent out.
8. The unauthorized communication detection reference deciding method according to claim 1, further comprising: calculating a prediction value of data included in a message to be received next, wherein, in the identifying, the communication pattern is identified by obtaining a model, obtained by executing statistical processing on information relating to the attack messages, as the communication pattern, wherein the calculating is performed using the communication pattern, and wherein, in the determining, whether or not the received message matches the communication pattern is determined based on the results of comparison between the prediction value and the data value that the received message includes.
9. The unauthorized communication detection reference deciding method according to claim 8, wherein, in the identifying, an autoregressive (AR) model, autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) model, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), or Bayesian model is obtained as the model.
10. An unauthorized communication detection reference deciding system for deciding a reference message used to detect unauthorized communication in an onboard network system, the onboard network system including a network and one or more electronic control units connected to the network, the reference message deciding system comprising: one or more processors; and one or more memories including at least one set of instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, causes the at least one processor to perform operations including identifying, from information relating to a plurality of attack messages of the same type detected in the unauthorized communication detection, a communication pattern indicating features of change in data values or communication timing of the plurality of attack messages of the same type or, from information relating to a plurality of attack messages of different types in the unauthorized communication detection, a communication pattern indicating features of change in the data values or the communication timing of the plurality of attack messages of different types, determining, when at least two messages of the same type sent out onto the network have not been determined to be attack messages during a predetermined reception cycle, whether or not the at least two messages match a communication pattern that has been identified, and deciding that one of the at least two messages determined not to match the communication pattern is to be used as a reference message for detecting the unauthorized communication during a predetermined next reception cycle, the reference message being used for calculation of the data values or the reception time of a message.
11. At least one non-transitory computer-readable recording medium storing a program causing an unauthorized communication detection system to detect unauthorized communication in an onboard network system to carry out a reference message deciding method, the unauthorized communication detection system including at least one processor and at least one memory, the onboard network system including a network and one or more electronic control units connected to the network, the program, when executed by the at least one processor, causes the at least one processor to perform operations including identifying, from information relating to a plurality of attack messages of the same type detected in the unauthorized communication detection, a communication pattern indicating features of change in data values or communication timing of the plurality of attack messages of the same type or, from information relating to a plurality of attack messages of different types in the unauthorized communication detection, a communication pattern indicating features of change in the data values or the communication timing of the plurality of attack messages of different types, determining, when at least two messages of the same type sent out onto the network have not been determined to be attack messages during a predetermined reception cycle, whether or not the at least two messages match a communication pattern that has been identified, and deciding that one of the at least two messages determined not to match the communication pattern is to be used as a reference message for detecting the unauthorized communication during a predetermined next reception cycle, the reference message being used for calculation of the data values or the reception time of a message.
