<title>
Resistive random-access memory for exclusive NOR (XNOR) neural networks
</title>

<abstract>
A resistive random-access memory (RRAM) system includes an RRAM cell. The RRAM cell includes a first select line and a second select line, a word line, a bit line, a first resistive memory device, a first switching device, a second resistive memory device, a second switching device, and a comparator. The first resistive memory device is coupled between a first access node and the bit line. The first switching device is coupled between the first select line and the first access node. The second resistive memory device is coupled between a second access node and the bit line. The second switching device is coupled between the second select line and the second access node. The comparator includes a first input coupled to the bit line, a second input, and an output.
