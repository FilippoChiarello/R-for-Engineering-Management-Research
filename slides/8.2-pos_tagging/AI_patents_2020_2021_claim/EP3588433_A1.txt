<title>
STENT POSITIONING
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to positioning of stents or other medical interventional devices. In order to provide an improved marker detection suitable for smaller markers, a device (10) for positioning a medical interventional device is provided. The device comprises a data input interface (12), a data processing unit (14) and a data output interface (16). The data input interface is configured to provide at least one image of a region of interest of a subject. In the at least one image, at least a part of a guiding apparatus for a medical interventional device is arranged in the region of interest, which part of the guiding apparatus comprises at least one apparatus position marker visible in the at least one image. Further, in the at least one image, a medical interventional device is arranged at least partly in the region of interest, which medical interventional device comprises device position markers, which are less visible in the image than the at least one apparatus position marker. The data processing unit is configured to detect the at least one apparatus position marker in the at least one image, and to define a proximity region in the at least one image based on the at least one apparatus position marker, and to select the proximity region, to detect the device position markers in the proximity region, and to enhance the device position markers in the at least one image for supporting a positioning of the medical interventional device. The data output interface is configured to provide the at least one image with the enhanced device position markers.
