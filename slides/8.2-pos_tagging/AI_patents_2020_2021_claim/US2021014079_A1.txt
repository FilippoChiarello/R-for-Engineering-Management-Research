SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR REMOTE MONITORING AND CONTROLLING OF BUILDING AUTOMATION DEVICES
</title>

<abstract>
A Building Automation Monitor and Control System (BAMCS) can discover building automation control devices operating on various communication protocols, and can enable a user to control multiple building automation control devices that use different communication protocols through a single user interface. A dealer can create a user site, discover building automation control devices, and sell a license to a user to be able to access a site control module over the internet.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system for accessing, monitoring and controlling building automation components comprising: a plurality of building automation devices; at least one site server in communication with the building automation devices; an interface server in communication with the site server, wherein the interface server has a website module, the website module having a user communication module that allows a user to monitor and control the plurality of building automation devices.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising a dealer communication module that allows a dealer to create a user site and sell the user license.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the dealer communication module allows a dealer to configure a user site and discover the building automation devices at the user site.
4. The system of claim 1, further comprising a service provider communication module that allows a service provider to create a dealer license and a user license.
5. A method for discovering and controlling building automation devices comprising: sending out commands to a network having at least one building automation device; gathering responses from the at least one building automation device; assembling the responses from the devices; presenting information about the assembled responses from the devices to a user; receiving at least one instruction from the user to control the at least one building automation device; translating the at least one instruction from the user into at least one communication protocol of the at least one building automation device; and sending the instructions to the at least one building automation device in the communication protocol of the at least one building automation device.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the assembling the responses from the devices further comprises assembling the responses from the devices according to installation configurations of the building automation devices.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein the translating the instructions from the user into at least one communication protocol of the at least one building automation device further comprises translating a first instruction from the user into a first communication protocol of a first building automation device, and translating a second instruction from the user into a second communication protocol of a second building automation device.
8. A system for enhancing the functionality of building automation components comprising: a site-based server with a network interface for communicating with a plurality of automation components arranged to communicate using at least one automation protocol; a database; a functionality module, wherein the functionality module can determine the level of functionality supported by at least one of the plurality of automation components; wherein when the functionality module determines a functionality is supported by the at least one of the plurality of automation components, the functionality module can communicate instructions in the automation protocol of the at least one automation component instructing the at least one automation component to perform the functionality, and wherein when the functionality module determines a functionality is not supported by the at least one of the plurality of automation components, the functionality module can perform the functionality within the site based server, wherein the functionality data is stored in the database.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the functionality is selected from the group consisting of scheduling, alarming, and trend log.
