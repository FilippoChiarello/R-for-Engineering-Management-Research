<title>
INTENT BASED CONTROL OF A ROBOTIC DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A method for controlling a robotic device includes monitor an action of an operator of the robotic device. The method also includes inferring an intended target based on the monitored action. The method further includes determining an intended action for the intended target. The method still further includes controlling the robotic device to perform the intended action.

<claims>
1. A method for controlling a robotic device, comprising: monitoring an action of an operator of the robotic device; inferring an intended target based on the monitored action; determining an intended action for the intended target; and controlling the robotic device to perform the intended action.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising transmitting, to the operator, a feed from a vision based sensor of the robotic device.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving, from the operator, confirmation of the intended target, in which the intended action based on the confirmation.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining the intended action based on a learned approach or a combination of the learned approach and a modeled approach.
5. The method of claim 4, in which: the learned approach is based on a previous action of the robotic device; and the modeled approach is based on a set of actions corresponding to the intended target.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving confirmation of the intended action, in which the robotic device is controlled based on the confirmation.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising controlling the robotic device to perform an action based on the intended target, the action performed prior to the robotic device performing the intended action.
8. An apparatus for controlling a robotic device, comprising: a memory; and at least one processor coupled to the memory, the at least one processor configured: to monitor an action of an operator of the robotic device; to infer an intended target based on the monitored action; to determine an intended action for the intended target; and to control the robotic device to perform the intended action.
9. The apparatus of claim 8, in which the at least one processor is further configured to transmit, to the operator, a feed from a vision based sensor of the robotic device.
10. The apparatus of claim 8, in which the at least one processor is further configured to receive, from the operator, confirmation of the intended target, in which the intended action based on the confirmation.
11. The apparatus of claim 8, in which the at least one processor is further configured to determine the intended action based on a learned approach or a combination of the learned approach and a modeled approach.
12. The apparatus of claim 11, in which: the learned approach is based on a previous action of the robotic device; and the modeled approach is based on a set of actions corresponding to the intended target.
13. The apparatus of claim 8, in which the at least one processor is further configured to receive confirmation of the intended action, in which the robotic device is controlled based on the confirmation.
14. The apparatus of claim 8, in which the at least one processor is further configured to control the robotic device to perform an action based on the intended target, the action performed prior to the robotic device performing the intended action.
15. A non-transitory computer-readable medium having program code recorded thereon for controlling a robotic device, the program code executed by a processor and comprising: program code to monitor an action of an operator of the robotic device; program code to infer an intended target based on the monitored action; program code to determine an intended action for the intended target; and program code to control the robotic device to perform the intended action.
16. The non-transitory computer-readable of claim 15, in which the program code further comprises program code to transmit, to the operator, a feed from a vision based sensor of the robotic device.
17. The non-transitory computer-readable of claim 15, in which the program code further comprises program code to receive, from the operator, confirmation of the intended target, in which the intended action based on the confirmation.
18. The non-transitory computer-readable of claim 15, in which the program code further comprises program code to determine the intended action based on a learned approach or a combination of the learned approach and a modeled approach.
19. The non-transitory computer-readable of claim 18, in which: the learned approach is based on a previous action of the robotic device; and the modeled approach is based on a set of actions corresponding to the intended target.
