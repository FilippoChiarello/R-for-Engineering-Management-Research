DETECTION APPARATUS AND DETECTION METHOD FOR MACHINE TOOL ABNORMALITY
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to an apparatus and a method for detecting an abnormality of a tool of a machine tool, and more particularly, to an apparatus and a method for correcting backlash of a machine tool, which are capable of repeatedly measuring a load of a workpiece transferring unit or a workpiece machining unit, and automatically detecting an abnormality of a tool based on a normal range of load data that are proportional to a standard deviation of the load data measured based on any one of a mode value, a mean value, or a median value of the repeatedly measured load data.

<claims>
1. An apparatus for detecting an abnormality of a tool of a machine tool, the apparatus comprising: a workpiece transferring unit configured to transfer a workpiece; a workpiece machining unit configured to machine the workpiece by a tool; and a control unit, wherein the control unit comprises: a storage unit configured to store information for detecting presence or absence of an abnormality of the tool; a measurement unit configured to measure a load of the workpiece transferring unit or the workpiece machining unit; a calculation unit configured to calculate a normal range of the measured load data; and a comparison unit configured to detect the presence or absence of an abnormality of the tool by comparing the normal range of the load data calculated by the calculation unit and the data measured by the measurement unit.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the control unit repeatedly measures the load of the workpiece transferring unit or the workpiece machining unit and detects the presence or absence of an abnormality of the tool based on the normal range of the load data that are proportional to a standard deviation of the load data measured based on a mode value of the repeatedly measured load data.
3. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the control unit further comprises:
a determination unit configured to determine the result of determining the presence or absence of an abnormality by the comparison unit and whether workpiece machining is performed by the workpiece machining unit.
4. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the calculation unit comprises: a mode-value calculating unit configured to calculate a maximum mode value and a minimum mode value among the load data measured by the measurement unit; a standard-deviation calculating unit configured to calculate a standard deviation of the load data measured by the measurement unit; and a normal-range calculating unit configured to calculate a maximum normal range and a minimum normal range based on the data stored in the storage unit and values calculated by the mode-value calculating unit and the standard-deviation calculating unit.
5. The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the storage unit comprises: a basic-data storing unit configured to store data of a maximum reference range, a minimum reference range, a maximum application ratio, and a minimum application ratio; a load-data storing unit configured to store the load data measured by the measurement unit; and a normal-range-data storing unit configured to store the maximum normal range and the minimum normal range calculated by the normal-range calculating unit.
6. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein the storage unit further comprises:
a determination-data storing unit configured to store, as standard data, the data stored in the basic-data storing unit, the load-data storing unit, and the normal-range-data storing unit when workpiece machining is normally ended as a result of the determination of the determination unit.
7. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising: a tool-abnormality-detection-automatic-selection-function input unit of the control unit; and a display unit configured to display results of the comparison unit and the determination unit.
8. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the calculation unit calculates the normal range of the load data that are proportional to the standard deviation of the load data measured based on any one of a mode value, a mean value, and a median value of the measured load data.
9. A method of detecting an abnormality of a tool of a machine tool, the method comprising: storing basic data; measuring a load of a workpiece transferring unit or a workpiece machining unit multiple times; storing measured load data; calculating a maximum mode value and a minimum mode value based on the measured load data; calculating a standard deviation based on the load data; calculating a maximum normal range and a minimum normal range based on the basic data, the maximum mode value, the minimum mode value, a maximum standard deviation, and a minimum standard deviation; storing the calculated normal range; comparing the real-time measured load data and the calculated normal range; and determining presence or absence of an abnormality of a tool and whether workpiece machining is performed by the workpiece machining unit.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising:
displaying that the measured load data deviates from the normal range when the measured load data deviates from the normal range after the comparing of the real-time measured load data and the calculated normal range.
11. The method of claim 9, further comprising:
storing the basic data, the load data, and the normal-range data as standard data when the workpiece machining is normally ended after the determining of the presence or absence of an abnormality of the tool and whether the workpiece machining is performed by the workpiece machining unit.
