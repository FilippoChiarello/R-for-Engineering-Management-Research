<claims>
1. System (10) for controlling distributed actuators (16), with: a plurality of control devices (14, 15) that are each connected to at least one actuator (16) via at least one communication port (18) of a respective control device (14, 15); and a computer system (12) that is connected to each control device (14, 15) via at least one communication link (19), wherein at the least the following information are available to the computer system (12): - communication information enabling communicating with the control devices (14, 15); - mapping information on which communication port (18) of each control device (14, 15) is connected to which actuator (16); the computer system (12) further being configured to: - determine a control instruction based on which at least one of the actuators (16) can be controlled; and - with help of the available information, send the control instruction to at least one of the control devices (14, 15) via the communication link (19), the control instruction defining the control device's communication port (18) to which said actuator (16) is connected.
2. System (10) according to claim 1,
wherein at least some of the control devices (14, 15) are one of a PLC, a PAC, a computer, a RTU, an intelligent sensor or a remote I/O.
3. System (10) according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein the control instructions are determined independently of the control devices (14, 15) and/or wherein at least during regular operation, the control devices (14, 15) do not generate control instructions for the actuators (16).
4. System (10) according to any of the previous claims,
wherein the control devices (14, 15) are configured to set a signal at a communication port (18), the signal being generated based on or correspoding to a received control instruction and preferably generated without altering a control action defined by the control instruction.
5. System (10) according to any previous claim,
wherein the computer system (12) comprises at least one of the following: - a software component (104) defining an actuator-specific data specification; - a software component (106) enabling an actuator-specific data unification and/or actuator-specific data transformation; - a software component (108) enabling communication between the computer system (12) and at least one control device (14, 15) according to a control-device-specific communication protocol; - a software component (102) which provides information usable for generating control instructions and/or which provides the mapping information.
6. System (10) according to any of the previous claims,
wherein the system (10) receives state signals relating to a state of an external environment and wherein at least some of the control instructions are generated based on said state signals.
7. System (10) according claim 6,
wherein at least one of the state signals is generated by at least one sensor (20) that is connected to a communication port (18) of one of the control devices (14, 15).
8. System (10) according to any of the previous claim,
wherein the computer system (12) is configured to execute a plurality of software applications (AAU), at least some of the software applications (AAU) being configured to generate control instructions for at least one of the actuators (16).
9. System (10) according to claim 8,
further comprising a human-machine-interface by means of which settings of the software applications (AAU) can at least indirectly be defined.
10. System (10) according to any previous claim,
wherein the communication information are provided by at least one control device driver (34, 35), wherein each control device driver (34, 35) is associated with a specific type of control device.
11. System (10) according to claim 10,
wherein the system comprises control devices of different types and control device drivers (34, 35) for each of these different types.
12. System (10) according to any previous claim,
wherein the system (10) is used to operate actuators (16) within a private home, an office environment, a public space, a production facility, a building or a commercial space.
13. System (10) according to any previous claim,
wherein at least one of the actuators (16) is or is part of one of the following: - a heat pump; - a heating system; - a HVAC system; - a lighting system; - a door actuating system; - a window actuating system; - a window blind actuating system; - a gardening appliance; - a household appliance; - a photovoltaic system; - a multimedia system; - an energy management system; - a home security system and/or surverillance system.
