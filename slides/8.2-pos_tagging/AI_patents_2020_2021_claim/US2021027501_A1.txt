INTENSITY DATA VISUALIZATION
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for coloring a point cloud based on colors derived from LIDAR (light detection and ranging) intensity data are disclosed. In some embodiments, the coloring of the point cloud may employ an activation function that controls the colors assigned to different intensity values. Further, the activation function may be parameterized based on statistics computed for a distribution of intensities associated with a 3D scene and a user-selected sensitivity. Alternatively, a Fourier transform of the distribution of intensities or a clustering of the intensities may be used to estimate individual distributions associated with different materials, based on which the point cloud coloring may be determined from intensity data.
