<title>
CYCLICAL OBSTRUCTION COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for improving data rates at mobile terminals that are subject to periodic channel interruptions in a beyond-line-of-sight communication system are disclosed, including improved encoding and decoding systems that identify blockages and modify receiver operation during blockages to reduce data errors. In certain embodiments, encoding, symbol mapping, interleaving, and use of unique periodic identifiers function to enable a series of packets that may be received in a blockage impaired channel with reduced errors.

1. (canceled)
2. A method, comprising: establishing a communication session with a terminal for transmission of one or more data packets via a wireless communication system; identifying that a communication channel used for communication with the terminal is intermittently obstructed; fragmenting the one or more data packets into a plurality of packet fragments, wherein a size of the plurality of packet fragments is determined based at least in part on obstruction characteristics of the intermittently obstructed communication channel; and transmitting the plurality of packet fragments to the terminal over the intermittently obstructed communication channel.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the size of the plurality of packet fragments is determined based at least in part on an unobstructed portion of a blockage period of the intermittently obstructed communication channel.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the fragmenting is performed at an Internet Protocol (IP) layer.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein the fragmenting is performed at a protocol layer below an Internet Protocol (IP) layer in a transmission layer stack.
6. The method of claim 2, wherein transmitting the plurality of packet fragments comprises transmitting each of the plurality of packet fragments followed by a respective duplicate packet fragment.
7. The method of claim 2, wherein transmitting the plurality of packet fragments comprises transmitting a sequence identifier with each of the plurality of packet fragments.
8. An apparatus for wireless communication, comprising: a transport processor configured to: establish a communication session with the terminal for transmission of one or more data packets via a wireless communication system; identify that a communication channel used for communication with the terminal is intermittently obstructed; and fragment the one or more data packets into a plurality of packet fragments, wherein a size of the plurality of packet fragments is determined based at least in part on obstruction characteristics of the intermittently obstructed communication channel; and a modulator configured to modulate the plurality of packet fragments for transmission to the terminal over the intermittently obstructed communication channel.
9. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the size of the plurality of packet fragments is determined based at least in part on an unobstructed portion of a blockage period of the intermittently obstructed communication channel.
10. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the fragmenting is performed at an Internet Protocol (IP) layer.
11. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the fragmenting is performed at a protocol layer below an Internet Protocol (IP) layer in a transmission layer stack.
12. The apparatus of claim 8, further comprising: a delay buffer configured to generate to a respective duplicate packet fragment for each of the plurality of packet fragments for transmission following the each of the plurality of packet fragments.
13. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the transport processor is further configured to include a sequence identifier with each of the plurality of packet fragments.
