TIP ATTACHMENT DISCRIMINATION DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A work device 20 includes, at a tip, one of different types of tip attachments 25 that are replaceable with each other. A camera 40 can capture an image within a movable range of the tip attachment 25. The work device posture sensor 30 detects the posture of the work device 20. A controller 60 sets a detection frame (F) that is a frame of a range including the tip attachment 25 in the image captured by the camera 40 based on the posture of the work device 20 detected by the work device posture sensor 30. The controller 60 discriminates the type of the tip attachment 25 based on the image of the tip attachment 25 within the detection frame (F).

<claims>
1. A tip attachment discrimination device of a work machine including: a lower travelling body; an upper slewing body provided above the lower travelling body; and a work device including a tip to which one of different types of tip attachments is attached in a replaceable manner, the work device being attached to the upper slewing body, the tip attachment discrimination device comprising: a camera attached to the upper slewing body and configured to capture an image within a movable range of the tip attachment; a work device posture sensor configured to detect a posture of the work device; and a controller, wherein the controller: sets a detection frame in an area including the tip attachment with respect to the image captured by the camera based on the posture of the work device detected by the work device posture sensor; and discriminates the type of the tip attachment based on the image of the tip attachment within the detection frame.
2. The tip attachment discrimination device according to claim 1, wherein the camera is fixed to the upper slewing body.
3. The tip attachment discrimination device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the controller sequentially changes a setting of the detection frame according to a change in the posture of the work device detected by the work device posture sensor.
4. The tip attachment discrimination device according to any one of claims I to 3, wherein the controller sets the detection frame based on structure information on the work machine.
5. The tip attachment discrimination device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein
the camera has a zoom function, and
the controller calculates a distance from the tip attachment to the camera based on the posture of the work device detected by the work device posture sensor, and sets a zoom position of the camera on a telephoto side as the distance increases.
6. The tip attachment discrimination device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein
in the controller, a posture in which the tip attachment is disposed on a side opposite to a side on which the camera is disposed with respect to a ground plane of the work machine is set in advance as a predetermined posture condition, and
the controller: performs processing for discriminating the type of the tip attachment when the posture of the work device detected by the work device posture sensor does not satisfy the predetermined posture condition; and does not perform the processing for discriminating the type of the tip attachment when the posture of the work device detected by the work device posture sensor satisfies the predetermined posture condition.
7. The tip attachment discrimination device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the controller: acquires a corresponding distance corresponding to the distance from the tip attachment to the camera based on the posture of the work device detected by the work device posture sensor; performs the processing for discriminating the type of the tip attachment when the corresponding distance is equal to or shorter than a predetermined distance determined in advance; and does not perform the processing for discriminating the type of the tip attachment when the corresponding distance is longer than the predetermined distance.
