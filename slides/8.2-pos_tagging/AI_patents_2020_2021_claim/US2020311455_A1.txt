METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR CORRECTING SENSOR INFORMATION
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and apparatus are provided for controlling a vehicle. In one embodiment, a method includes: receiving, by a processor, object detection data that indicates a plurality of objects detected in an environment of the vehicle; computing, by the processor, a correction value associated with at least one of range, roll, and pitch of the plurality of objects based on a likelihood function; applying, by the processor, the correction value to the object detection data to obtain corrected object detection data; and controlling, by the processor, the vehicle based on the corrected object detection data.

1. A method of controlling a vehicle, comprising: receiving, by a processor, object detection data that indicates a plurality of objects detected in an environment of the vehicle; computing, by the processor, a correction value associated with at least one of range, roll, and pitch of the plurality of objects based on a likelihood function; applying, by the processor, the correction value to the object detection data to obtain corrected object detection data; and controlling, by the processor, the vehicle based on the corrected object detection data.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining when the vehicle is at an intersection with cross traffic, and wherein the receiving, the computing, and the applying are performed when the vehicle is at the intersection.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining when the cross traffic exceeds a threshold, and wherein the receiving, the computing, and the applying are performed when the cross traffic exceeds the threshold.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the computing the correction value is further based on an expectation maximization algorithm.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the computing the correction value comprises: evaluating the likelihood function on a grid for a give observation window; coarsely locating N largest local maximas from the grid; removing any maximas less than a threshold; merging nearby maximas; and applying the expectation maximization algorithm when there is one maxima remaining.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein when there are more than one maxima remaining, selecting a worst case.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein when there are more than one maxima remaining, applying the expectation maximization algorithm to each coarse maxima and generating a hypotheses for each refined correction value with a probability given mixing a weight.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the computing comprises computing the correction value for a window of data of the object detection data.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the correction value is associated with range.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the correction values is associated with pitch and roll.
11. A system for controlling a vehicle, comprising: at least one sensor that senses objects within an environment of the vehicle; and a controller configured to, by a processor, receive object detection data that indicates a plurality of objects detected in an environment of the vehicle, compute a correction value associated with at least one of range, roll, and pitch of the plurality of objects based on a likelihood function, apply the correction value to the object detection data to obtain corrected object detection data, and control the vehicle based on the corrected object detection data.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the controller determines when the vehicle is at an intersection with cross traffic, and performs the receiving, the computing, and the applying when the vehicle is at the intersection.
