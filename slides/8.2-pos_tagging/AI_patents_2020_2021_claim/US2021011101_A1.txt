METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR ACTUATION OF A GRADIENT COIL
</title>

<abstract>
A method for actuating a gradient coil can include the provision of a target value for a manipulated variable, the output of the manipulated variable according to the target value to the gradient coil, the capture of an actual value of the output manipulated variable, the scaling of the captured actual value taking into consideration a scaling characteristic depending on the target value, and the transformation of the actual value captured in a scaled manner into a digital actual value.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for actuating a gradient coil, comprising: provisioning a target value for a manipulated variable; outputting the manipulated variable according to the target value to the gradient coil; capturing an actual value of the output manipulated variable; scaling the captured actual value taking into consideration a scaling characteristic depending on the target value; and transforming the actual value captured in a scaled manner into a digital actual value.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the target value is time-dependent and the scaling characteristic takes into consideration a value range for the target value for a defined period of time.
3. The method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the defined period of time corresponds to a timeframe of a magnetic resonance (MR) control sequence to be output from the magnetic resonance device.
4. The method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the target value and/or the value range for the target value is stipulated by gradient pulses included in a magnetic resonance (MR) control sequence to be output by a magnetic resonance device.
5. The method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the scaling characteristic comprises a function configured such that the value range is within an input range of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that transforms the captured actual value into the digital actual value.
6. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the dependency of the scaling characteristic on the target value is binary and/or incremental.
7. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising: comparing the digital actual value with the target value for the manipulated variable; and adjusting the output of the manipulated variable according to the target value based on a deviation of the digital actual value from the target value for the manipulated variable.
8. The method as claimed in claim 7, wherein the scaling characteristic is taken into consideration in the comparison of the digital actual value with the target value.
9. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the provision of the target value for the manipulated variable is based on the scaling characteristic.
10. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising adapting the outputting of the manipulated variable based on the digital actual value.
11. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising actuating the gradient coil based on the outputted manipulated variable.
12. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the outputting the manipulated variable comprises regulating the manipulated variable based on a previously captured actual value.
13. The method as claimed in claim 12, wherein the regulating the manipulated variable is further based on the scaling characteristic.
14. A computer program product having a computer program which is directly loadable into a memory of an actuation facility of a magnetic resonance (MR) system, when executed by the actuation facility, causes the acutation facility to perform the method as claimed in claim 1.
15. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium with an executable program stored thereon, that when executed, instructs a processor to perform the method of claim 1.
16. An actuation facility for a gradient coil of a magnetic resonance (MR) device, the actuation facility comprising: a controller configured to generate a target value for a manipulated variable; an output configured to generate the manipulated variable according to the target value and provide the generated manipulated variable to the gradient coil; a sensor configured to capture an actual value of the output manipulated variable; a scaler configured to scale the captured actual value taking into consideration a scaling characteristic depending on the target value; and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) configured to transform the actual value captured in a scaled manner into a digital actual value.
17. The actuation facility as claimed in claim 16, wherein the output comprises a regulator that is configured to adapt the manipulated variable based on the digital actual value.
18. A gradient system comprising: the actuation facility as claimed in claim 16; and the gradient coil.
