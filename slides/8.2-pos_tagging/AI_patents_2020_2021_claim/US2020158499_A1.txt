<title>
Material Testing By Angle-Variable Illumination
</title>

<abstract>
An optical system includes an illumination module configured to illuminate a sample object with at least one angle-variable illumination geometry. The optical system includes an imaging optical unit configured to produce an imaged representation of the sample object that is illuminated with the at least one angle-variable illumination geometry on a detector. The optical system includes the detector, which is configured to capture at least one image of the sample object based on the imaged representation. The optical system includes a controller configured to determine a result image based on a transfer function and the at least one image. A method includes illuminating a sample object with at least one angle-variable illumination geometry, imaging the sample object on a detector, based on the imaged representation, capturing at least one image of the sample object, and, based on a transfer function and the at least one image, determining a result image.
