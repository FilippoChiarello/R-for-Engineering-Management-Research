Computing validation and error discovery in computers executing a multi-level tax data validation engine
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-method for improving operation of a computer by validating incoming data provided to a tax evaluation software program. The computer-implemented method includes selecting a gate at which the data is to be validated. Selecting is performed from among a plurality of gates. Each of the plurality of gates comprises a corresponding pre-selected organization of validation rules which at least specifies a corresponding level of validation. The gate has a particular organization of validation rules at a particular level of validation. The computer-implemented method also includes validating the data at the gate. The computer-implemented method also includes performing machine learning analysis on the operation of validating the data to determine an applicability of other rules in other gates. The computer-implemented method also includes, responsive to detecting a failure in validation of the data at the gate, generating, and displaying on a display device, a cause for the failure.
