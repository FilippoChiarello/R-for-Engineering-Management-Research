METHOD OF GENERATING USER FEEDBACK INFORMATION TO ENHANCE PRODUCT USE RESULTS
</title>

<abstract>
A skin care computing device that includes a user interface, a camera, a speaker, a communication interface, and a personal care assistant application. The personal care assistant application can identify personal care products being used by a user and product use event data describing the use of a personal care product by the user, such as the date and time of the use, the duration and frequency of the use, and the manner in which the personal care product is being used. Then the personal care assistant application generates user feedback information for the personal care product based on the product use event data, previous instances of product use event data, and/or user profile data for the user.
