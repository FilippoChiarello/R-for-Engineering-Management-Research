Anomaly diagnosis method and anomaly diagnosis apparatus
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided an anomaly diagnosis method performed by an anomaly diagnosis apparatus that diagnosis to determine whether an observed value composed of values of variables representing a state of a monitoring target obtained by observing the monitoring target is anomalous. The anomaly diagnosis apparatus includes a processor and a memory. The memory stores an anomaly detection model generated by learning using observed values. The processor acquires group information indicating one or more groups each constituted by a combination of at least two mutually-related variables, acquires the observed value, determines whether the observed value is anomalous by employing the anomaly detection model read from the memory, and in a case where the observed value is determined to be anomalous, identifies a group causing an anomaly among the one or more groups in the observed value.
