<title>
Capnometry system with supplemental oxygen detection and method of operation thereof
</title>

<abstract>
A capnography system (100, 400), comprising: a controller (110, 410) configured to obtain a sample gas flow from a physical interface (107) for a patient (101); determine a change in a characteristic of the sample gas flow during a sampling time interval; determine whether the change in the characteristic of the sample gas flow during the sampling time interval is equal to or greater than a corresponding threshold value; determine that supplemental oxygen is provided when it is determined that the change in the characteristic of the sample gas flow is equal to or greater than the threshold value; and determine that supplemental oxygen is not provided when it is determined that the change in the characteristic of the sample gas flow is less than the threshold value.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A capnography system, comprising: a controller configured to obtain a sample gas flow from a physical interface for a patient; determine a change in pressure of the sample gas flow during a sampling time interval using a ratio of a change in sample pressure (ΔSGF) to a change in differential pressure (ΔDP); determine whether the change in the pressure of the sample gas flow during the sampling time interval is equal to or greater than a corresponding threshold value; determine that supplemental oxygen is provided when it is determined that the change in the pressure of the sample gas flow is equal to or greater than the threshold value; determine that the supplemental oxygen is not provided when it is determined that the change in the pressure of the sample gas flow is less than the threshold value; and form a message which indicates whether the supplemental oxygen is determined to be provided; and a rendering device configured to display the formed message.
2. The capnography system of claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to form a first message which indicates that the supplemental oxygen is recommended when it is determined that the supplemental oxygen is not provided and one or more patient conditions indicates that the supplemental oxygen is recommended, and form a second message which indicates that the supplemental oxygen is not recommended when it is determined that the supplemental oxygen is provided and the one or more patient conditions indicates that the supplemental oxygen is not recommended.
3. The capnography system of claim 2, wherein the controller is further configured to render a third message that is an alarm message when the controller renders at least one of the first and second messages.
4. The capnography system of claim 1, further comprising: a flow restrictor fluidically coupled to the physical interface, wherein the controller is further configured to obtain the sample gas flow through the flow restrictor and determine a change in differential pressure in the sample gas flow.
5. The capnography system of claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to render at least one of concentration and partial pressure of carbon dioxide gas.
6. A capnography system, comprising: a controller which: obtains a sample gas flow from a physical interface coupled to a user; determines a change in pressure of the sample gas flow during a sampling time interval using a ratio of a change in sample pressure (ΔSGF) to a change in differential pressure (ΔDP); determines whether the change in the pressure of the sample gas flow during the sampling time interval is equal to or greater than a corresponding threshold value; renders results of the determination, wherein the controller is further configured to determine that supplemental oxygen is not provided when it is determined that the change in the pressure of the sample gas flow is less than the threshold value, forms a message which indicates whether the supplemental oxygen is determined to be provided, wherein a rendering device is configured to display the formed message.
7. The capnography system of claim 6, further comprising: a pneumatic system that provides a ventilation gas to the physical interface for inhalation by the user.
8. The capnograph system of claim 6, wherein the rendering device is further configured to display a graph of the pressure of the sample gas flow during the sampling time interval.
9. A method of determining whether supplemental oxygen is being provided in a capnographic system, the method comprising: obtaining, with a controller in the capnographic system, a sample gas flow from a physical interface for a patient; determining, with a controller in the capnographic system, a change in pressure of the sample gas flow during a sampling time interval using a ratio of a change in sample pressure (ΔSGF) to a change in differential pressure (ΔDP); determining, with the controller in the capnographic system, whether the change to the pressure of the sample gas flow during the sampling time interval is equal to or greater than a threshold value; determining, with the controller in the capnographic system, that supplemental oxygen is provided when it is determined that the change in the pressure of the sample gas flow is equal to or greater than the threshold value; determining, with the controller in the capnographic system, that the supplemental oxygen is not provided when it is determined that the change in the pressure of the sample gas flow is less than the threshold value; and forming a message which indicates whether the supplemental oxygen is determined to be provided.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising acts of: determining whether one or more patient conditions indicates that the supplemental oxygen is recommended; forming a first message which indicates that the supplemental oxygen is recommended when it is determined that the supplemental oxygen is not provided and the one or more patient conditions indicates that the supplemental oxygen is recommended; and forming a second message which indicates that the supplemental oxygen is not recommended when it is determined that the supplemental oxygen is provided and the one or more patient conditions indicates that the supplemental oxygen is not recommended.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising: rendering a third message that is an alarm message when the controller renders at least one of the first and second messages.
12. The method of claim 9, further comprising: determining a change in differential pressure in the sample gas flow.
