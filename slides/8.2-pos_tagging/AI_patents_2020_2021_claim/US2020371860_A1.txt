METHOD FOR REMEDIATION OF COMPUTER PROBLEMS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for resolving a computer problem without human intervention are provided. The methods include receiving an alert that indicates an existence of a computer problem; obtaining data that relates to the computer problem; determining a potential resolution based on the obtained data; and applying the determined potential resolution to the computer that is experiencing the problem.

<claims>
1. A method for resolving a computer problem, the method being implemented by a processor on a computing device, the method comprising: receiving, from a client computer, an alert that indicates an existence of the computer problem; obtaining, by processor, data from the client computer that relates to the computer problem; determining, by the processor, a potential resolution based on the obtained data; and applying, by the processor, the determined potential resolution to the client computer.
2. The method of claim 1, the determining of the potential resolution is performed without human intervention.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the computer problem includes at least one from among an application service being disabled, a memory capacity being exceeded, a data throughput rate being excessively high, a data throughput rate being excessively low, a central processing unit (CPU) utilization being excessively high, and a cyber fraud problem.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the potential resolution includes at least one from among restarting the client computer, restarting an application service, increasing a cloud infrastructure scale, decreasing a cloud infrastructure scale, reallocating disk space in a memory, and blocking a user account.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving, from a server associated with Splunk software, a communication that includes at least one from among an event that relates to the computer problem and a metric that relates to the computer problem.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the determining of the potential resolution is based on both of the obtained data that relates to the computer problem and the received communication.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising retrieving, from a database, historical data that relates to previous computer problems and/or resolutions.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the determining of the potential resolution is based on both of the obtained data that relates to the computer problem and the retrieved historical data.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising storing the obtained data and a result of the determining of the potential resolution in the database.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising using at least one machine learning algorithm to predict a future problem based on the stored obtained data, the stored result of the determining of the potential resolution, and the retrieved historical data.
11. A computing apparatus for resolving a computer problem, the computing apparatus comprising: a processor; a memory; and a communication interface coupled to each of the processor and the memory, wherein the processor is configured to: receive, from a client computer the communication interface, an alert that indicates an existence of the computer problem; obtain data from the client computer that relates to the computer problem; determine a potential resolution based on the obtained data; and apply the determined potential resolution to the client computer.
12. The computing apparatus of claim 11, wherein the processor is further configured to determine the potential resolution without human intervention.
13. The computing apparatus of claim 11, wherein the computer problem includes at least one from among an application service being disabled, a memory capacity being exceeded, a data throughput rate being excessively high, a data throughput rate being excessively low, a central processing unit (CPU) utilization being excessively high, and a cyber fraud problem.
14. The computing apparatus of claim 11, wherein the potential resolution includes at least one from among restarting the client computer, restarting an application service, increasing a aloud infrastructure scale, decreasing a cloud infrastructure scale, reallocating disk space in a memory, and blocking a user account.
15. The computing apparatus of claim 11, wherein the processor is further configured to receive, from a server associated with Splunk software via the communication interface, a communication that includes at least one from among an event that relates to the computer problem and a metric that relates to the computer problem.
16. The computing apparatus of claim 15, wherein the processor is further configured to determine the potential resolution based on both of the obtained data that relates to the computer problem and the received communication.
17. The computing apparatus of claim 11, wherein the processor is further configured to retrieve, from a database that is accessible via the memory, historical data that relates to previous computer problems and/or resolutions.
18. The computing apparatus of claim 17, wherein the processor is further configured to determine the potential resolution based on both of the obtained data that relates to the computer problem and the retrieved historical data.
19. The computing apparatus of claim 18, wherein the processor is further configured to store the obtained data and a result of the determining of the potential resolution in the database.
20. The computing apparatus of claim 19, wherein the processor is further configured to use at least one machine learning algorithm to predict a future problem based on the stored obtained data, the stored result, of the determining of the potential resolution, and the retrieved historical data.
