SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR WRITING AND READING DATA STORED IN A POLYMER
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method of storing and reading digital data, including providing a nanopore polymer memory (NPM) device having at least one memory cell comprising at least two addition chambers each arranged to add a unique chemical construct (or codes) to a polymer (or DNA) string when the polymer enters the respective addition chamber, the data comprising a series of codes; successively steering the polymer from deblock chambers through the nanopore into the addition chambers to add codes to the polymer to create the digital data pattern on the polymer; and accurately controlling the bit rate of the polymer using a servo controller. The device may have loading chamber(s) to load (or remove) the polymer into/from the deblock chambers through at least one "micro-hole". The cell may be part of a memory system that stores and retrieves "raw" data and allows for remote retrieval and conversion. The cell may store multi-bit data having a plurality of states for the codes.

<claims>
1. A method of controlling the data bit rate of data stored on a polymer passing through a nanopore in a nanopore-based memory device, comprising: receiving a reference mean bit rate; receiving data bits read from the data stored on the polymer and determining a real-time instantaneous bit rate; calculating an actual mean bit rate based on the instantaneous bit rate; calculating a bit rate difference between the reference mean bit rate and the actual mean bit rate; and dynamically controlling a steering voltage which controls the data bit rate of data stored on the polymer passing through the nanopore, such that the actual mean bit rate is maintained substantially at the reference mean bit rate.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the controlling the steering voltage is performed by dynamic control logic.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the dynamic control logic comprises at least one of: a proportional-integral (P-I), proportional, proportional-integral-derivative (P-I-D), low pass (LP), high pass (HP), bandpass (BP), quadratic (2nd order), linear, non-linear, lead/lag, and multi-order control.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising accurately controlling the bit rate of the polymer using a servo controller.
5. The method of claim 4 further comprising steering the polymer through the nanopore at a read bit rate to read the codes on the polymer and wherein the controller controls the read bit rate of the polymer when reading the codes stored on the polymer.
6. The method of claim 4 wherein the device comprises a plurality of memory cells and the servo controller controls the bit rate for each of the memory cells independently.
7. A method of storing and retrieving data using a polymer, comprising: storing data in a nanopore polymer memory device, the device having an add "0" chamber, an add "1" chamber, and a "deblock" chamber, and the data being encoded as part of the storing process as raw stored data; retrieving the raw stored data from the nanopore memory cell; and processing the raw data to provide clean data for use by a user device.
8. The method of claim 7 further comprising receiving the clean data by the user device.
9. The method of claim 7 wherein the use comprises at least one of accessing, reading, using, and storing the clean data.
10. The method of claim 7 further comprising requesting the raw data or clean data be retrieved.
11. A method for loading a polymer into a nanopore-based device, comprising: providing at least one memory cell, each cell having at least two add chambers each of the add chambers having a nanopore arranged to allow the polymer to enter and exit the add chamber from an adjacent deblock chamber, and each of the add chambers arranged to add a unique code to the polymer when the polymer enters the respective add chamber, the deblock chamber arranged to enable the polymer to receive the code when the polymer enters the respective add chamber and the deblock chamber having at least one loading hole in a side opposite from the nanopore; providing a loading chamber, fluidically connected to the deblock chamber via the at least one loading hole; loading the loading chamber with a loading fluid having the polymer; and loading the polymer from the loading chamber through the loading hole into the deblock chamber; and sealing the loading hole.
12. The method of claim 11 further comprising removing the loading fluid from the loading chamber.
13. The method of claim 11 further comprising detaching the loading chamber from the deblock chamber after the loading.
14. The method of claim 11 wherein the sealing is performed after the detaching.
15. The method of claim 11 wherein the loading comprises at least one of: active loading and passive loading.
16. A method for storing data on a polymer in a nanopore-based device, comprising: providing a memory cell having at least three add chambers each of the add chambers having a nanopore arranged to allow the polymer to enter and exit the add chamber and each of the add chambers arranged to add a unique code to the polymer when the polymer enters the respective add chamber, and a "deblock" chamber arranged to enable the polymer to receive the code when the polymer enters the respective add chamber; and successively steering the polymer from the "deblock" chamber through the nanopore to the add chambers to add the codes to the polymer based on a predetermined digital data pattern to create the digital data pattern on the polymer.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the number of unique codes for each memory cell is a binary number greater than 2.
18. The method of claim 16, wherein the number of unique codes for each memory cell is: 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, or 65536.
19. The method of claim 16, wherein each code is indicative of a digit in a word, the digit having a Base-N based on the number of unique codes, and the word having a length M based on the number of digits.
20. The method of claim 16, wherein the number of unique codes for each memory cell is automatically determined in real-time by the number of operational add-chambers.
