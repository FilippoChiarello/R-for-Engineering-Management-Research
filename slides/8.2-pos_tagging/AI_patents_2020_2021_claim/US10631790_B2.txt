Vital sign measurement apparatus
</title>

<abstract>
A vital sign measurement apparatus including: an input operation section; a first measurement section capable of measuring first vital signs; first and second operating systems; a first arithmetic processing section that runs on the first operating system and that arithmetically processes the first vital signs on the basis of an input signal from the input operation section, thereby generating a first arithmetically processed signal; a second arithmetic processing section that runs on the second operating system, that is communicable with the first arithmetic processing section, and that generates a second arithmetically processed signal on the basis of the input signal from the input operation section by use of the first arithmetically processed signal transmitted from the first arithmetic processing section; and an output control section that can receive the first and second arithmetically processed signals and that outputs at least one of the received arithmetically processed signals.
