IR DROP PREDICTION WITH MAXIMUM CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
IR drop predictions are obtained using a maximum convolutional neural network. A circuit structure is partitioned into a grid. For cells of the circuit structure in sub-intervals of a clock period, power consumption of the cell is amortized into a set of grid tiles that include portions of the cell, thus forming a set of power maps. The power maps are applied to a neural network to generate IR drop predictions for the circuit structure.
