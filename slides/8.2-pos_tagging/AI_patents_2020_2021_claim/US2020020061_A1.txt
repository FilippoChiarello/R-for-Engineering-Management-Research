METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PERFORMING NEGOTIATION TASK USING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING AGENTS
</title>

<abstract>
This disclosure relates generally to method and system for performing negotiation task using reinforcement learning agents. Performing negotiation on a task is a complex decision making process and to arrive at consensus on contents of a negotiation task is often expensive and time consuming due to the negotiation terms and the negotiation parties involved. The proposed technique trains reinforcement learning agents such as negotiating agent and an opposition agent. These agents are capable of performing the negotiation task on a plurality of clauses to agree on common terms between the agents involved. The system provides modelling of a selector agent on a plurality of behavioral models of a negotiating agent and the opposition agent to negotiate against each other and provides a reward signal based on the performance. This selector agent emulate human behavior provides scalability on selecting an optimal contract proposal during the performance of the negotiation task.

4. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein assigning the reward for each behavior model of the intermediate contract proposal comprises: a maximum reward is assigned to the negotiating agent and the opposition agent, if the generated intermediate contract proposal is optimal; and a minimum reward is assigned to the negotiating agent and the opposition agent, if the generated intermediate contract proposal is not optimal.
5. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein selecting the optimal contract proposal using the selector agent comprises: obtaining, the plurality of contract proposals generated by the negotiating agent and the opposition agent for each behavior from the plurality of behavioral models; and determining, the intermediate contract proposal utilizing the plurality of contract proposals obtained from the plurality of behavioral models of the negotiating agent and the opposition agent and the maximum reward attained by each of the intermediate contract proposals and the frequency distribution of the negotiating agent selection sequence.
6. A system (102) for performing a negotiation task, the system (102) comprises: a processor (202); an Input/output (I/O) interface (204); and a memory (208) coupled to the processor (202), the memory (208) comprising: receive, by a negotiating agent implemented by the processor, a request for performing the negotiation task between the negotiating agent and an opposition agent, to agree on an optimal contract proposal comprising a plurality of clauses from a set of clauses predefined for the negotiation task, wherein each of the negotiating agent and the opposition agent comprises a plurality of behavioral models modeled based on a reward function; negotiate one on one, by the negotiating agent with the plurality of behavioral models of the opposition agent to agree on a plurality of intermediate contract proposals, wherein the negotiation between each of the negotiating agent and the opposition agent is in accordance with a negotiation training procedure; and select, by a selector agent, the optimal contract proposal from the plurality of intermediate contract proposals generated by performing negotiation between the negotiation agent and the opposition agent based on the negotiation training procedure, wherein the selector agent is an ensemble of the plurality of behavioral models of the negotiating agent and the opposition agent.
7. The system (102) as claimed in claim 6, wherein each of the plurality of behavioral models comprises a Selfish-Selfish (SS) model, a Selfish-Prosocial (SP) model, a Prosocial-Selfish (PS) model and a Prosocial-Prosocial (PP) model reflecting behavioral aspect of the negotiating agent paired with behavioral aspect of the opposition agent.
8. The system (102) as claimed in claim 6, wherein the negotiating training procedure for performing the negotiation task between each of the negotiating agent and the opposition agent comprises: obtaining, by the negotiating agent at time step T a plurality of state inputs, wherein the plurality of state inputs includes a utility function, an opponent offer, a previous opponent offer and an agent ID; generating, by the negotiating agent for the corresponding behavior from the plurality of behavioral models, a first intermediate contract proposal utilizing the plurality of said state inputs for performing the negotiation task, wherein the first intermediate contract proposal predicts the number of bits to be flipped during the performance of the negotiation task; generating, by the opposition agent at next time step 't+1' for the corresponding behavior from the plurality of behavioral models, a second intermediate contract proposal based on the first intermediate contract proposal obtained from the negotiating agent, wherein the second intermediate contract proposal maximizes the offer in the intermediate contract proposal for performing the negotiation task; and assigning, a reward for each behavior model of the intermediate contract proposal of the negotiating agent and the opposition agent based on the performed negotiation task.
