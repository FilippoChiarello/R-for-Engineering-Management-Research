<title>
IDENTIFYING CANCER THERAPIES
</title>

<abstract>
In silico tools are used to determine possibly effective therapies for treating a patient's cancer based on patient, drug, and cancer information. Functional assays can be performed on living cancer cells from the patient to evaluate the possibly effective therapies along with subsequent genomic or other more destructive assays to provide additional information from a single sample. Drug, patient, cancer, and outcome information can be recorded and updated iteratively and analyzed using machine learning to identify correlations between various patient, cancer, and drug characteristics and expected outcomes and drug efficacies.

<claims>
1. A method for selecting a cancer treatment, the method comprising:
obtaining a biological sample containing cancer cells from a patient;
identifying, in silico, a therapeutic that meets predetermined criteria relating to one or more selected from the group of toxicology, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, side-effects, drug interactions, patient compliance, and cost;
performing an in vitro assay to determine efficacy of the identified therapeutic; and where the efficacy is above a threshold, selecting the identified therapeutic for treating cancer in the patient.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the biological sample is from a patient having received a prior therapy for cancer.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the predetermined criteria further comprises the prior therapy the patient has received.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the in vitro assay measures a functional feature of live cells of the biological sample.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the functional feature comprises change in mass of the live cancer cells.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the change in mass is measured using at least one suspended microchannel resonator.
7. The method of claim 4, further comprising isolating individual, live cells, from the biological sample before performing the in vitro assay on the individual, live cells.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the biological sample comprises a tissue sample.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the tissue sample is a biopsy sample
10. The method of claim 9, where the biopsy sample is obtained by fine needle biopsy and comprises less than 50,000 cancer cells.
11. The method of claim 4, further comprising collecting one or more of the live cells after performing the in vitro assay.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising analyzing the collected one or more cells for a cancer biomarker.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the analyzing step comprises extracting nucleic acid or protein from the collected one or more cells and performing a biomarker assay on the extracted nucleic acid or protein to identify a cancer biomarker.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein said identifying step comprises categorizing treatments with respect to cancer type.
15. The method of claim 1, further comprising recording, in a database, one or more of the functional feature measurement, the therapeutic, the predetermined criteria, patient data, and patient response to the therapeutic.
16. The method of claim 15, further comprising updating one or more of the group consisting of the toxicology, the efficacy, the pharmacokinetics, and the cost of the therapeutic with information from the database.
17. The method of claim 1, wherein the in vitro assay is performed within about 48 hours after obtaining the biological sample.
18. The method of claim 1, wherein the in vitro assay is performed within about 24 hours after obtaining the biological sample.
19. The method of claim 1, wherein the in vitro assay is performed within about 6 hours after obtaining the biological sample.
