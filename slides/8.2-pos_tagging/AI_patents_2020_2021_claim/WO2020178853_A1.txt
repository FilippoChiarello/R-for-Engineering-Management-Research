REAL-TIME CONTEXT SHARING SOCIAL NETWORKING PLATFORM

<abstract>
A system and method for conveying an information on a context of a user to peer's user device is disclosed. To derive the context of the user, a location data, and a user device ID is received from a user device associated with the user. Further, an activity data of the user is received from at least one of the user devices, and a wearable device worn by the user. Then the context of the user is derived using the location data or the activity data or both. Upon deriving the context, one or more actions are performed based on the context and one or more rules defined by the user. The actions include, modifying one or more functions of the user device associated with the user and communicating the information on the context of the user to the user device of the peer through a communication network.

<claims>
We Claim:
1. A method for conveying an information on a context of a user to peer's user device, the method comprising:
receiving a location data and a user device ID from a user device associated with the user;
receiving activity data of the user from at least one of the user device associated with the user, a wearable device worn by the user and one or more sensors; deriving the context of the user from the location data or the activity data or both; and
performing one or more actions based on the context of the user and one or more rules defined by the user, wherein the or more actions comprises:
modifying one or more functions of the user device associated with the user; and
communicating the information on the context of the user to the user device of the peer through a communication network.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the location data, the user device ID and the activity data of the user are received periodically.
3. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the context of the user is derived periodically using the location data or the activity data or both.
4. The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the activity of the user is determined from the location data or the activity data or both using a machine learning module.
5. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the one or more rules defined by the user comprise one or more rules for modifying the one or more functions of the user device based on the derived context, and one or more privacy rules for communicating the information on the context of the user to the user device of the peer.
6. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the derived context is categorized into of a basic activity context, professional context, sports context and fitness context,
7. A system (100) for conveying an information on a context of a user to peer's user device (120), the system comprising: a user device (110) associated with the user, the user device (110) configured for collecting activity data of the user;
a communication network (130); and
a server (105) in communication with the user device (110) and the peer's user device (120) through the communication network (130), wherein the server (105) comprises:
an activity data collection module (220) configured for receiving a location data and a user device ID from the user device (110) and the activity data of the user from at least one of the user device (110), a wearable device worn by the user and one or more sensors;
a context analyzer module (225) configured for deriving the context of the user from the location data or the activity data or both;
a context actuator module (230) configured for modifying one or more functions of the user device (110) associated with the user based on the context of the user and one or more rules defined by the user; and
a context information communication module (235) configured for communicating the information on the context of the user to the user device (120) of the peer through a communication network (130).
