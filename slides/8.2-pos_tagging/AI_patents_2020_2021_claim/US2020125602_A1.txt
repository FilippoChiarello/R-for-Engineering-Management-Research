SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR QUERYING A DATA REPOSITORY
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for querying data in a data repository. According to a first aspect, this disclosure describes a method of querying a database, comprising: receiving, at a computing device, a plurality of keywords; determining, by the computer device, a plurality of datasets relating to the keywords; identifying, by the computer device, metadata for the plurality of datasets indicating a relationship between the datasets by examining an ontology associated with the datasets; providing, by the computer device, one or more suggested database queries in natural language form, the one or more suggested database queries constructed based on the plurality of keywords and the metadata; receiving, by the computing device, a selection of the one or more suggested database queries; and constructing, by the computer device, an object view for the plurality of datasets based on the selected query and the metadata.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of querying a database, comprising: receiving, at a computing device, a plurality of keywords; determining, by the computer device, a plurality of datasets relating to the keywords; identifying, by the computer device, metadata for the plurality of datasets indicating a relationship between the datasets by examining an ontology associated with the datasets; providing, by the computer device, one or more suggested database queries in natural language form, the one or more suggested database queries constructed based on the plurality of keywords and the metadata; receiving, by the computing device, a selection of the one or more suggested database queries; and constructing, by the computer device, an object view for the plurality of datasets based on the selected query and the metadata.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the metadata comprises an indication of one or more joins between the datasets in the plurality of datasets.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the metadata comprises one or more directional relationships between the datasets in the plurality of datasets.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the metadata comprises one or more of: synonyms for dataset titles, row and/or column titles; and/or an object property.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of keywords comprises one or more of: object identities; actions; temporal ranges; geographic locations; numerical ranges; values; relationships; and/or reference numbers.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the plurality datasets relating to the keywords comprises identifying, using the ontology, datasets whose rows and/or columns comprise data labelled with a property relating to the keyword.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the property comprises one or more of: a row and/or column title; a dataset title; a flag provided in the ontology; a synonymous term to the keyword; and/or one or more classifications of the dataset.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein constructing an object view for the plurality of datasets based on the selected query and the metadata comprises generating a computer readable database query based on the selected query and the metadata.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising outputting the computer readable database query via a user interface in an editable format.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein constructing an object view for the plurality of datasets based on the selected query and the metadata comprises generating a table from the plurality of datasets based on the selected query and the metadata by joining at least a subset of data from each of the identified tables.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein constructing an object view for the plurality of datasets based on the selected query and the metadata comprises applying one or more filters to one or more of the plurality of datasets based on the selected query and the metadata.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the object view comprises one or more of: a table; a histogram; a bar graph; a line graph; a scatter graph; and/or a pie chart.
13. The method of claim 1, further comprising outputting the object view for the plurality of datasets to a user interface.
14. A system comprising: a user interface; a query builder module; a data repository comprising a plurality of datasets; and an ontology comprising metadata indicative of relationships between the plurality of datasets, wherein the system is configured to: receive, via the user interface, a plurality of keywords; determine, by the query builder, a plurality datasets relating to the keywords; identify, by the query builder, metadata for the plurality of datasets indicating a relationship between the datasets by examining the ontology associated with the datasets; provide, by the query builder, one or more suggested database queries in natural language form, the suggested queries constructed based on the plurality of keywords and the metadata; receive, via the user interface, a selection of the one or more suggested database queries; and construct, by the query builder, an object view for the plurality of datasets based on the selected query and the metadata.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the metadata comprises an indication of one or more joins between the datasets in the plurality of datasets.
16. The system of claim 14, wherein the metadata comprises one or more directional relationships between the datasets in the plurality of datasets.
17. The system of claim 14, wherein the metadata comprises one or more of: synonyms for dataset titles, row and/or column titles; and/or an object property.
18. The system of claim 14, wherein the plurality of keywords comprises one or more of: object identities; actions; temporal ranges; geographic locations; numerical ranges; values; relationships; and/or reference numbers.
19. The system of claim 14, wherein determining the plurality datasets relating to the keywords comprises identifying, using the ontology, datasets whose rows and/or columns comprise data labelled with a property relating to the keyword.
20. A non-transitory computer readable medium having computer readable code stored thereon, the computer readable code, when executed by at least one processor of a computing device, causing performance of the steps of: receiving, at the computing device, a plurality of keywords; determining, by the computer device, a plurality of datasets relating to the keywords; identifying, by the computer device, metadata for the plurality of datasets indicating a relationship between the datasets by examining an ontology associated with the datasets; providing, by the computer device, one or more suggested database queries in natural language form, the suggested queries constructed based on the plurality of keywords and the metadata; receiving, by the computing device, a selection of the one or more suggested database queries; and constructing, by the computer device, an object view for the plurality of datasets based on the selected query and the metadata.
