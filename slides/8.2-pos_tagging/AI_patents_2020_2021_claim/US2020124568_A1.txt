APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE USING MALDI-TOF MASS SPECTROMETRY
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for determining resistance of microorganisms, which may comprise: a storage unit including a database for storing first region mass spectrum data for a plurality of microorganisms and second region mass spectrum data used to determine resistance of each of the plurality of microorganisms; and a processor including a resistance determination module which determines resistance to an antibiotic by comparing the second region mass spectrum data with mass spectrum data of a microorganism sample to be determined.
