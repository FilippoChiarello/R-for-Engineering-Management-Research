METHOD FOR GRAPHICALLY PRESENTING A PLURALITY OF SCANS
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a system and method for presenting a graphical representation of an oral situation of a patient over time. In particular the system and method relates to a method of presenting a plurality of scans taken over time in manner where the focus on the changes in the oral situation of the patient is maintained.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method for presenting a graphical
representation of an oral situation of a patient over time, wherein the method comprises,
- obtaining a plurality of scans, each scan representing the oral situation of the patient at a specific time, and where each scan comprises a scan boundary defining the extent of the scan,
- determining at least one modified boundary, and
- presenting the plurality of scans in a time sequence wherein the scan boundary of each of the respective plurality of scans has been modified based on one of the at least one modified boundary.
2. A method according to claim 1 , wherein the step of presenting the
plurality of scans in a time sequence wherein the scan boundary of each of the respective plurality of scans has been modified based on one of the at least one modified boundary further comprises that the at least one modified boundary is used as a reference for morphing between at least two of the plurality of scans in a time sequence. 3. A method according to claim 2, wherein a base domain is defined based on the at least one modified boundary.
4. A method according to claim 1 , wherein the step of presenting the
plurality of scans in a time sequence wherein the scan boundary of each of the respective plurality of scans has been modified based on one of the at least one modified boundary, comprises that the scan boundary of each of the respective plurality of scans is at least partly modified to one of the at least one modified boundary.
5. A method according to claim 4, wherein the at least one modified boundary is a pre-set boundary.
6. A method according to claim 4 or 5, wherein the at least one modified boundary is determined based on a reference scan selected from the plurality of scans.
7. A method according to claim 4, 5 or 6, wherein the scan boundary of the reference scan is set as the at least one modified boundary.
8. A method according to claim 4, 5, 6 or 7, wherein the at least one
modified boundary is determined based on at least two of the plurality of scans. 9. A method according to claim 8, wherein the determining the at least one modified boundary based on at least two of the plurality of scans comprises,
- determining at least a first and a second scan boundary of the at least two of the plurality of scans respectively, and
- determining the at least one modified boundary based on an average boundary of the at least first and second scan boundary.
10. A method according to any one of the claims 1 - 9, wherein a plurality of modified boundaries are determined comprising at least a first and a second modified boundary.
11. A method according to claim 10, wherein the first common and second modified boundary are pre-set boundaries with a different size and/or shape.
12. A method according to claim 10, wherein the first modified boundary is determined based on at least two of the plurality of scans and wherein the second modified boundary is determined based on at least two of the plurality of scans, where at least one of the two of the plurality of scans for determining the second modified boundary is different from the at least two of the plurality of scans for determining the first modified boundary.
13. A method according to claim 10, 11 or 12, wherein the scan boundaries of the scans of a first group of the plurality of scans is modified to the first modified boundary, and the scan boundaries of the scans of a second group comprising scans different from the first group of the plurality of scans is modified to the second modified boundary.
14. A method according to claim 10, 11 , 12 or 13, wherein the plurality of modified boundaries further comprises a third or more modified
boundaries comprising either a pre-set boundary or a boundary
determined based on at least two of the plurality of scans.
15. A method according to claim 13, wherein the first and second and/or more groups are determined based on one or more time variable of the scans in the respective groups.
16. A method according to any one of the claims 1 - 15, wherein the scan boundary of at least two scans are modified to have the same at least one modified boundary.
