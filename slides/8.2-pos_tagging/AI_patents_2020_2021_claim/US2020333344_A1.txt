USE OF MARKERS INCLUDING FILAMIN A IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF PROSTATE CANCER
</title>

<abstract>
Methods for diagnosing the presence of prostate cancer in a subject are provided, such methods including the detection of levels of variety of biomarkers diagnostic of prostate cancer, including filamin A alone, or in combination with one or more additional biomarkers of prostate cancer, including, PSA, keratin 4, keratin 7, keratin 8, keratin 15, keratin 18, keratin 19, tubulin-beta 3, filamin B, and LY9. Additionally, age can be used as a predictor variable. The invention also provides methods of treating prostate cancer which rely on diagnostic information obtained based on the detection of biomarkers of prostate cancer, including filamin A alone, or in combination with one or more additional biomarkers of prostate cancer, including, PSA, keratin 4, keratin 7, keratin 8, keratin 15, keratin 18, keratin 19, tubulin-beta 3, filamin B, LY9, and/or age. Compositions in the form of kits and panels of reagents for detecting the biomarkers of the invention are also provided.

<claims>
1. A method for detecting the level of filamin A in a sample from a subject comprising: (a) selecting a subject who has elevated PSA and is symptomatic of prostate cancer; (b) isolating a serum sample or a plasma sample from the subject, and (c) detecting the protein level of filamin A in the serum sample or plasma sample.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising detecting the level of one or more additional markers of prostate cancer in the sample.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the one or more additional markers of prostate cancer is selected from the group consisting of filamin B, LY9, keratin 4, keratin 7, keratin 8, keratin 15, keratin 18, keratin 19, tubulin-beta 3, and prostate specific antigen (PSA).
4. (canceled)
5. The method of claim 96, wherein the reagent is an anti-filamin A antibody that selectively binds to at least one epitope of filamin A.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the level of filamin A protein is determined by immunoassay or ELISA.
7. (canceled)
8. (canceled)
9. (canceled)
10. (canceled)
11. (canceled)
12. (canceled)
13. (canceled)
14. (canceled)
15. A method for detecting the level of filamin A in a sample from a subject comprising: (a) obtaining a serum sample or a plasma sample from a subject, wherein the subject has elevated PSA and is symptomatic of prostate cancer, and (b) detecting the protein level of filamin A in the serum sample or plasma sample.
16. The method of claim 97, wherein the reagent is an anti-filamin A antibody that selectively binds to at least one epitope of filamin A.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the antibody comprises a detectable label.
18. The method of claim 16, wherein the step of detecting the level of the complex further comprises contacting the complex with a detectable secondary antibody and measuring the level of the secondary antibody.
19. The method of claim 15, further comprising detecting the level of one or more additional markers of prostate cancer.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein the one or more additional markers of prostate cancer is selected from the group consisting of filamin B, LY9, keratin 4, keratin 7, keratin 8, keratin 15, keratin 18, keratin 19, tubulin-beta 3, and prostate specific antigen (PSA).
21. (canceled)
22. (canceled)
23. (canceled)
24. The method of claim 16, wherein the level of the complex is detected by immunoassay or ELISA.
25. -67.
68. A kit for detecting filamin A in a biological sample from a subject having, suspected of having, or at risk for having prostate cancer comprising at least one reagent for measuring the level of filamin A in the biological sample from the subject, and a set of instructions for measuring the level of filamin A in the biological sample from the subject.
69. 69-86. (canceled)
87. The method of any one of claims 1-3, 5, 6, 15-20, 24, and 94-97, further comprising determining the age of the subject.
88. 88.-93. (canceled)
94. The method of claim 5, wherein the antibody comprises a detectable label.
95. The method of claim 5, wherein the step of detecting the level of the complex further comprises contacting the complex with a detectable secondary antibody and measuring the level of the secondary antibody.
96. The method of claim 1, wherein detecting the protein level of filamin A in the serum sample or plasma sample is by contacting the sample with a reagent that selectively binds keratin A, allowing a complex to form between the reagent and filamin A, and detecting the level of the complex.
97. The method of claim 15, wherein detecting the protein level of filamin A in the serum sample or plasma sample is by contacting the sample with a reagent that selectively binds keratin A, allowing a complex to form between the reagent and filamin A, and detecting the level of the complex.
