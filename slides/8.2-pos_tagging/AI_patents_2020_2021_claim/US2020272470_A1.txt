SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ENABLING FIRMWARE TRANSACTIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A transaction-enabling system is provided. The system includes a controller configured to access a distributed ledger comprising a firmware data value and tokenize the firmware data value. The controller is further configured to interpret an access request for the firmware data value and, in response to the access request, provide a provable access to a firmware corresponding to the firmware data value. The controller is further configured to interpret one of a download operation or an install operation of a firmware asset corresponding to the firmware data value, and record a transaction on the distributed ledger in response to the one of the download operation or the install operation.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A transaction-enabling system comprising a controller, wherein the controller is configured to: access a distributed ledger comprising a firmware data value; tokenize the firmware data value; interpret an access request for the firmware data value; in response to the access request, provide a provable access to a firmware corresponding to the firmware data value; interpret one of a download operation or an install operation of a firmware asset corresponding to the firmware data value; and record a transaction on the distributed ledger in response to the one of the download operation or the install operation.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to provide a notification to an accessor of the firmware data value in response to an update of the firmware data value.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the firmware data value comprises firmware for a component of a production process.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the component of the production process comprises a production tool.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the production tool comprises a production tool for a process selected from the processes consisting of: a coating process, a 3D printing process, a semiconductor fabrication process, a food preparation process, a polymer production process, a chemical synthesis process, a biological production process, or a crystal fabrication process.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the firmware data value comprises firmware for at least one of a compute resource or a networking resource.
7. A method, comprising: accessing a distributed ledger comprising a firmware data value; tokenizing the firmware data value; interpreting an access request for the firmware data value; in response to the access request, providing a provable access to firmware corresponding to the firmware data value; interpreting a download operation of a firmware asset corresponding to the firmware data value; and recording a transaction on the distributed ledger in response to the download operation.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising providing a notification to an accessor of the firmware data value in response to an update of the firmware data value.
9. The method of claim 7, further comprising interpreting an install operation of the firmware asset corresponding to the firmware data value, and recording a transaction on the distributed ledger in response to the install operation.
10. The method of claim 7, wherein the firmware data value comprises firmware for a component of a production process.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the component of the production process comprises a production tool.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the production tool comprises a production tool for a process selected from the processes consisting of: a coating process, a 3D printing process, a semiconductor fabrication process, a food preparation process, a polymer production process, a chemical synthesis process, a biological production process, or a crystal fabrication process.
13. The method of claim 7, wherein the firmware data value comprises firmware for one of a compute resource or a networking resource.
14. A transaction-enabling system comprising a controller, wherein the controller is configured to: access a distributed ledger comprising a firmware data value; tokenize the firmware data value; interpret an access request for the firmware data value; in response to the access request, provide a provable access to a firmware corresponding to the firmware data value; and provide a notification to an accessor of the firmware data value in response to an update of the firmware data value.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the firmware data value comprises firmware for a component of a production process.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the component of the production process comprises a production tool.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein the production tool comprises a production tool for a process selected from the processes consisting of: a coating process, a 3D printing process, a semiconductor fabrication process, a food preparation process, a polymer production process, a chemical synthesis process, a biological production process, or a crystal fabrication process.
18. The system of claim 14, wherein the firmware data value comprises firmware for at least one of a compute resource and a networking resource.
19. The system of claim 14, wherein the controller is further configured to interpret one of a download operation or an install operation of a firmware asset corresponding to the firmware data value.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein the controller is further configured to record a transaction on the distributed ledger in response to the one of the download operation or the install operation.
