<title>
Avionic display system
</title>

<abstract>
A system for displaying the effect of a change in Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) broadcast. The system comprises a receiver module configured to receive at least two ATIS broadcasts and a parsing module operably connected to the receiver module and configured to parse the received at least two ATIS broadcasts into at least two corresponding sets of ATIS messages. The system includes a comparison module operably connected to the parsing module and configured to compare the at least two sets of ATIS messages to determine if a disparity exists between the at least two sets of ATIS messages. The system includes a display module; and a processor module operably connected to the comparison module and the display module, the processor module being configured to cause the display module to display an alert when it is determined that a disparity exists between the at least two sets of ATIS messages.

<claims>
1. A system for displaying a change in an Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) broadcast, comprising: a transmitter module configured to automatically request receipt of an ATIS broadcast at predetermined intervals of a first length; a receiver module configured to receive at least two ATIS broadcasts; a parsing module operably connected to the receiver module and configured to parse the received at least two ATIS broadcasts into at least two corresponding sets of ATIS messages; a comparison module operably connected to the parsing module and configured to compare the at least two sets of ATIS messages to determine if a disparity exists between the at least two sets of ATIS messages; a display module; and a processor module operably connected to the comparison module and the display module and configured to cause the display module to display information about the disparity when it is determined that a disparity exists between the at least two sets of ATIS messages.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising a memory module operably connected to the parsing module and configured to store at least one of the at least two sets of ATIS messages.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor module is further configured to cause the display module to display a representation of an effect of the disparity between the at least two sets of ATIS messages.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein, when an ATIS broadcast is not received in response to the request, the transmitter module is configured to continue requesting receipt of the ATIS broadcast at predetermined intervals of a second length shorter than the first length.
5. The system of claim 3, wherein the representation comprises a display of takeoff and landing data (TOLD) parameters, and wherein the processor module is configured to cause the display module to display updated TOLD parameters based on the disparity.
6. The system of claim 3, wherein the representation comprises a display of a standard instrument departure (SID), standard terminal approach route (STAR) or Instrument Approach Procedure (IAP), and wherein the processor module is configured to cause the display module to display an updated SID, STAR or IAP based on the disparity.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the processor module is configured to estimate a position of at least one of a new transition waypoint and a new initial approach fix (IAF) and to cause the display module to display the estimated position.
8. The system of claim 3, wherein the representation comprises a display of active runways, and wherein the processor module is configured to cause the display module to display a change in active runways based on the disparity.
9. A method of displaying the effect of a change in Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS), comprising the steps of: automatically requesting, using a transmitter, a first ATIS broadcast at a predetermined time; receiving, using a receiver module, the first ATIS broadcast; parsing, using a parsing module, the first ATIS broadcast into a first set of ATIS messages; storing, using a memory module, the first set of ATIS messages in memory; receiving, using the receiver module, a second ATIS broadcast; parsing, using the parsing module, the second ATIS broadcast into a second set of ATIS messages; comparing, using a comparison module, the stored first set of ATIS messages to the second set of ATIS messages to determine if a disparity exists; and when a disparity is determined to exist, displaying, using a processor module and a display module, information about the disparity.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the step of displaying information about the disparity comprises displaying a representation of an effect of the disparity.
11. The method of claim 9, further comprising the step of automatically re-requesting, using the transmitter, the first ATIS broadcast at predetermined intervals if the first ATIS broadcast is not received in response to the request.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein displaying the representation of an effect of the disparity comprises displaying takeoff and landing data (TOLD) parameters, wherein displaying the effect of the disparity comprises updating the TOLD parameters.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein displaying the representation of an effect of the disparity comprises displaying a representation of a standard instrument departure (SID), standard terminal arrival route (STAR), or an Instrument Approach Procedure (IAP) and wherein displaying the effect of the disparity comprises altering the representation of the SID, STAR or IAP.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the step of altering the representation of the STAR or TAP comprises estimating an updated position of at least one of new transition waypoint and a new initial approach fix (IAF) and displaying the updated position.
15. The method of claim 10, wherein displaying the representation of an effect of the disparity comprises displaying a representation of active runways at an airport, and wherein displaying the effect of the disparity comprises altering the representation of active runways.
16. The method of claim 10, wherein displaying the representation of an effect of the disparity comprises displaying a table of ATIS data, and wherein displaying the effect of the disparity comprises altering the table of ATIS data and displaying a visual indicator positioned proximate to an alteration.
