VEHICLE CONTROL DEVICE, AND VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle control device which controls acceleration/deceleration of a vehicle includes: a switch controller; a recognizer; an actual vehicle-to-vehicle distance calculator; and a target vehicle-to-vehicle distance calculator. Switching criteria for the switch controller's switching the control condition from the first control condition to the second control condition include a criterion that the absolute value of a difference between an actual vehicle-to-vehicle distance calculated by the actual vehicle-to-vehicle distance calculator and a target vehicle-to-vehicle distance calculated by the target vehicle-to-vehicle distance calculator is less than or equal to a predetermined threshold.

<claims>
1. A vehicle control device which controls acceleration and deceleration of a host vehicle, comprising: a switch controller which switches a control condition set by the vehicle control device between a first control condition and a second control condition which requires a driver to perform less operations than the first control condition, or which automates more operations than the first control condition; a recognizer which recognizes a peripheral vehicle running around the host vehicle; a first distance calculator which calculates a first distance based on an actual vehicle-to-vehicle distance between the host vehicle and a preceding vehicle recognized by the recognizer; and a second distance calculator which calculates a second distance based on a target vehicle-to-vehicle distance between the host vehicle and the preceding vehicle, wherein switching criteria for the switch controller's switching the control condition from the first control condition to the second control condition include a criterion that a difference between the first distance calculated by the first distance calculator and the second distance calculated by the second distance calculator is equal to or less than a predetermined threshold.
2. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein the switching criteria include a criterion that a running state where the difference between the first distance calculated by the first distance calculator and the second distance calculated by the second distance calculator is equal to or less than the predetermined threshold is kept for a predetermined time period.
3. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein the second distance becomes wider as a vehicle speed of the host vehicle becomes higher.
4. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein the second distance further includes a condition where the acceleration of the host vehicle falls within a predetermined range.
5. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein the switching criteria include a criterion that a total sum of absolute values of amounts of changes in the vehicle speed of the host vehicle in the running state where the difference between the first distance and the second distance is equal to or less than the predetermined threshold is equal to or less than a predetermined threshold.
6. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein the switching criteria include a criterion that the acceleration of the host vehicle in the running state continues being a positive acceleration or a negative acceleration.
7. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein when the running state where the difference between the first distance and the second distance is equal to or less than the predetermined threshold is detected, a count for a time period for which the running state continues is started, and in a case where the continuation time period does not reach a predetermined time period, the count is reset.
8. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein the switching criteria includes at least one of the vehicle speed of the host vehicle being equal to or less than a first speed threshold, and a vehicle speed of the preceding vehicle being equal to or less than a second speed threshold.
9. The vehicle control device according to claim 8, wherein in a case where the preceding vehicle remains the same when a one-time switch from the first control condition to the second control condition is followed by a switch from the second control condition to the first control condition, at least one of shortening a switch suppression time length for which the same control condition is required to be kept and increasing the first speed threshold is performed out of the switching criteria.
10. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein while the host vehicle is in the first control condition, the driver can select a length of the second distance corresponding to the vehicle speed of the host vehicle from a first setting and a second setting which is longer than the first setting, and determination on the switching criteria is made based on the selected second distance.
11. The vehicle control device according to claim 10, wherein in a case where the second distance is the first setting when the control condition is shifted to the second control condition, the second distance is automatically changed to the second setting.
12. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein the first distance is the actual vehicle-to-vehicle distance, and the second distance is the target vehicle-to-vehicle distance.
13. A vehicle comprising the vehicle control device according to claim 1.
