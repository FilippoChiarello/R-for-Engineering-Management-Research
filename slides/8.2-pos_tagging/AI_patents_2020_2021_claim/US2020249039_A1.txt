PLANNING VEHICLE COMPUTATIONAL UNIT MIGRATION BASED ON MOBILITY PREDICTION
</title>

<abstract>
Various embodiments are provided for planning computational unit (e.g., virtual machine (VM)) migration based on vehicle mobility prediction in a computing environment by a processor. A computational unit handover operation may be dynamically planned associated with a vehicle using one or more predicted routes according to global positioning satellite ("GPS") data, contextual data, historical data, a maximum latency requirement for the vehicle, one or more load balancing requirements for an edge computing server.
