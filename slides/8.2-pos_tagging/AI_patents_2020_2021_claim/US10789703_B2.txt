<title>
Semi-supervised anomaly detection in scanning electron microscope images
</title>

<abstract>
Autoencoder-based, semi-supervised approaches are used for anomaly detection. Defects on semiconductor wafers can be discovered using these approaches. The model can include a variational autoencoder, such as a one that includes ladder networks. Defect-free or clean images can be used to train the model that is later used to discover defects or other anomalies.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: a wafer inspection tool configured to generate images of a wafer, wherein the wafer inspection tool includes an electron beam source and a detector; and a processor in electronic communication with the wafer inspection tool, wherein the processor operates a model configured to find one or more anomalies in the images, wherein the model is trained using semi-supervised machine learning based on only defect-free training images of semiconductor devices.

3. The system of claim 1, wherein the model includes a variational autoencoder.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the variational autoencoder includes ladder networks.
5. A method comprising: receiving an image of a wafer at a processor, wherein the processor operates a model configured to find one or more anomalies in the image, wherein the model is trained using semi-supervised machine learning based on only defect-free training images of semiconductor devices; and determining presence of one or more anomalies in the image using the model.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the image is a scanning electron microscope image.

12. The method of claim 5, wherein the one or more anomalies are each one of an anomaly patch or an anomaly region.
13. The method of claim 5, further comprising: determining, using the processor, a distance between the image and the defect-free training images in a feature space; and determining, using the processor, if the image is an outlier based on the distance.
14. The method of claim 5, further comprising determining, using the processor, if the image is an outlier using a generative adversarial network with an autoencoder as a generator and a convolutional neural network as a discriminator.
15. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, comprising one or more programs for executing a model on one or more computing devices, wherein the model is trained using semi-supervised machine learning based on only defect-free training images of semiconductor devices, and wherein the model is configured to: receive an image of a wafer; and determine presence of one or more anomalies in the image.
