ATTACK DEFENSE METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TERMINAL, TERMINAL, AND CLOUD SERVER
</title>

<abstract>
An attack defense method and apparatus for a terminal, a terminal, and a cloud server. Before a client application (CA) communicates with a secure application (TA), a secure execution environment such as a trusted execution environment (TEE) verifies scenario feature information, such as screen touch information, corresponding to a current operation of the client application, to determine whether the operation is an actual operation of a user or a hacker attack. If the operation is a hacker attack, there is no screen touch information. If there is a risk of a hacker attack, communication between the client application and the secure application is not established, so that the client application cannot run properly, and an attempt initiated by a hacker to discover a system vulnerability is blocked.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An attack defense method for a terminal, the method comprising: receiving, by a secure execution environment, a communication request of a first client application (CA) for communication with a first secure application (TA), wherein the secure execution environment comprises either or both of a trusted execution environment (TEE) and a cloud security environment, and the communication request comprises current first scenario feature information corresponding to the first CA; the scenario feature information comprises any one or more of the following information: terminal screen touch information, terminal screen status information, and client application running information, wherein the terminal screen touch information comprises any one or more of the following information: a quantity of taps on a terminal screen, a touch location on the terminal screen, and a manner of touching the terminal screen when the client application is operated, the terminal screen status information comprises any one or more of the following information: a terminal screen-on state and a terminal screen luminance value, and the client application running information is used to indicate whether the client application runs in the foreground; and establishing, when the secure execution environment verifies the first scenario feature information, by the secure execution environment, communication between the first secure application and the first client application.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein that the secure execution environment performs verification on the first scenario feature information comprises: determining, by the secure execution environment, whether a prestored scenario feature information set comprises second scenario feature information that matches the first scenario feature information, and the prestored scenario feature information set comprises scenario feature information corresponding to a plurality of client applications and operations of the plurality of client applications.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein the determining, by the secure execution environment, of whether a prestored scenario feature information set comprises second scenario feature information that matches the first scenario feature information comprises: traversing the scenario feature information set to obtain the second scenario feature information corresponding to a client application name and a client application operation that are respectively the same as the first client application and a current operation of the first client application; and determining whether the second scenario feature information is consistent with the first scenario feature information.
4. The method according to claim 2, further comprising: receiving, by the secure execution environment, scenario feature information update data from a rich execution environment (REE) side; and updating the scenario feature information set based on the scenario feature information update data.
5. An attack defense method for a terminal having a rich execution environment (REE) deployed on the terminal, the method comprising: sending, by the REE, a communication request of a first client application (CA) for communication with a first secure application (TA), the communication request comprising current first scenario feature information corresponding to the first client application, the scenario feature information comprising any one or more of the following information: terminal screen touch information, terminal screen status information, and client application running information, the terminal screen touch information comprising any one or more of the following information: a quantity of taps on a terminal screen, a touch location on the terminal screen, and a manner of touching the terminal screen when the client application is operated, the terminal screen status information comprising any one or more of the following information: a terminal screen-on state and a terminal screen luminance value, and the client application running information is used to indicate whether the client application runs in the foreground; and controlling a current operation of the first client application based on a status of communication between the first client application and the first secure application.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the controlling a current operation of the first client application based on a status of communication between the first client application and the first secure application comprises: if communication is established between the first client application and the first secure application, allowing the current operation of the first client application.
7. The method according to claim 5, further comprising: receiving, by the REE, scenario feature information update data from a network side; and sending the scenario feature information update data to a secure execution environment.
8. A terminal, the terminal having a rich execution environment (REE) and a trusted execution environment (TEE) deployed on the terminal, the terminal comprising: a processor; and a memory, the memory configured to store a computer-executable instruction; wherein when the processor executes the computer-executable instruction, the TEE performs receiving, by a secure execution environment, a communication request of a first client application (CA) for communication with a first secure application (TA), wherein the secure execution environment comprises either or both of a TEE and a cloud security environment, and the communication request comprises current first scenario feature information corresponding to the first client application, wherein the scenario feature information comprises any one or more of the following information: terminal screen touch information, terminal screen status information, and client application running information, wherein the terminal screen touch information comprises any one or more of the following information: a quantity of taps on a terminal screen, a touch location on the terminal screen, and a manner of touching the terminal screen when the client application is operated, the terminal screen status information comprises any one or more of the following information: a terminal screen-on state and a terminal screen luminance value, and the client application running information is used to indicate whether the client application runs in the foreground; and when the secure execution environment verifies the first scenario feature information, establishing, by the secure execution environment, communication between the first secure application and the first client application; and the REE performs: sending, by the REE, a communication request of a first client application for communication with a first secure application, wherein the communication request comprises current first scenario feature information corresponding to the first CA, wherein the scenario feature information comprises any one or more of the following information: terminal screen touch information, terminal screen status information, and client application running information, wherein the terminal screen touch information comprises any one or more of the following information: a quantity of taps on a terminal screen, a touch location on the terminal screen, and a manner of touching the terminal screen when the client application is operated, the terminal screen status information comprises any one or more of the following information: a terminal screen-on state and a terminal screen luminance value, and the client application running information is used to indicate whether the client application runs in the foreground; and controlling a current operation of the first client application based on a status of communication between the first client application and the first secure application.
