Display lighting systems with circadian effects
</title>

<abstract>
Display systems for displaying digital content. The display systems have one or more LED-based lighting channels adapted to generate a circadian-inducing blue light output in first operational mode and a less-circadian-inducing blue light output in a second operational mode. The circadian-inducing blue light can have a first circadian-stimulating energy characteristic related to the associated first spectral power distributions of light generated in the first operational mode, and the non-circadian-inducing blue light can have a second circadian-stimulating energy characteristic related to the associated second spectral power distribution of light generated in the second operational mode. Disclosure methods of generating digital display content with the display systems described herein. The methods can generate a circadian-inducing blue light output in first operational mode and a less-circadian-inducing blue light output in a second operational mode.
