</title>

<abstract>
A bicycle can include a forward frame triangle that can include a top tube, a bottom tube, a bottom bracket, a structural seat tube, a compliant seat tube, and a pair of seat stays. The top tube can have a first end connected to a head tube and a second end. The bottom tube can have a first end connected to the head tube. The bottom bracket can be connected to the bottom tube. The structural seat tube can be connected to the bottom bracket and the top tube. The compliant seat tube can extend in an upward direction from the bottom bracket to the top tube and within the structural seat tube. The compliant seat tube can be coupled to the forward frame triangle such that the compliant seat post can bend within the structural seat tube.

<claims>
1. A bicycle, comprising: a frame including a top tube and a head tube; a fork including a steer tube, wherein the steer tube comprises at least one routing feature selected from a flat face and a cable tray; handlebars; at least one spacer positioned between the head tube and the handlebars, wherein the at least one spacer includes a right portion and a left portion that is detachable from the right portion; and an internal cable; wherein: the internal cable is routed at least partially inside the handlebars to the steer tube; and the internal cable is routed between the routing feature of the steer tube and the spacer.
2. The bicycle of claim 1, wherein the right portion is mechanically fixed to the left portion.
3. The bicycle of claim 1, wherein the right portion includes at least a pair of right connecting mechanisms and the left portion includes at least a pair of left connecting mechanisms configured to couple to the pair of right connecting mechanisms.
4. The bicycle of claim 1, wherein the at least one spacer includes a cable exit configured to direct the internal cable into the top tube.
5. The bicycle of claim 1, wherein the handlebars are made of a fiber reinforced plastic.
6. The bicycle of claim 1, wherein the internal cable is further routed through a cable exit of the at least one spacer and into the top tube at a cable entry.
7. The bicycle of claim 1, wherein the internal cable is further routed through a bushing that surrounds the steer tube and into the head tube.
8. The bicycle of claim 7, further comprising a front brake assembly coupled to the fork; wherein the internal cable is coupled to the front brake assembly.
9. The bicycle of claim 8, further comprising brake doors located in a bottom of the head tube and configured to open as the front brake assembly is rotated with the fork.
10. The bicycle of claim 1, further comprising a barrel adjuster assembly located within a down tube of the frame; wherein a finger wheel of the barrel adjuster assembly is configured to tension the internal cable, and the finger wheel is accessible from the outside of the down tube.
