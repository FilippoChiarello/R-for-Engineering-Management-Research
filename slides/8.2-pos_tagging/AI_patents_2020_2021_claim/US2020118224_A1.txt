TRANSACTION-ENABLED SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING AND ACQUIRING MACHINE RESOURCES ON A FORWARD RESOURCE MARKET
</title>

<abstract>
Transaction-enabled systems and methods for identifying and acquiring machine resources on a forward resource market are disclosed. An example system may include a controller having a resource requirement circuit to determine an amount of a resource required for a machine to service a task requirement, a forward resource market circuit to access a forward resource market, a resource market circuit to access a resource market, and a resource distribution circuit to execute a transaction of the resource on at least one of the resource market or the forward resource market in response to the determined amount of the resource required.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A transaction-enabling system, comprising: a machine having at least one of a compute task requirement, a networking task requirement, and an energy consumption task requirement; and a controller, comprising: a resource requirement circuit structured to determine an amount of a resource for the machine to service at least one of the compute task requirement, the networking task requirement, and the energy consumption task requirement; a forward resource market circuit structured to access a forward resource market; a resource market circuit structured to access a resource market; and a resource distribution circuit structured to execute a transaction of the resource on at least one of the resource market or the forward resource market in response to the determined amount of the resource.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the resource distribution circuit is further structured to adaptively improve at least one of an output of the machine or a resource utilization of the machine.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the resource distribution circuit further comprises at least one of a machine learning component, an artificial intelligence component, or a neural network component.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the resource comprises a compute resource.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the resource comprises an energy resource.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the resource comprises an energy credit resource.
7. The system of claim 1, further comprising: wherein the resource requirement circuit is further structured to determine a second amount of a second resource for the machine to service at least one of the compute task requirement, the networking task requirement, and the energy consumption task requirement; and wherein the resource distribution circuit is further structured to execute a first transaction of the first resource on one of the resource market or the forward resource market, and to execute a second transaction of the second resource on the other one of the resource market or the forward resource market.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the second resource comprises a substitute resource for the first resource during at least a portion of an operating condition for the machine.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the forward resource market comprises a futures market for the resource at a first time scale, and wherein the resource market comprises one of: a spot market for the resource, or a futures market for the resource at a second time scale.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the transaction comprises at least one transaction type selected from the transaction types consisting of: a sale of the resource; a purchase of the resource; a short sale of the resource; a call option for the resource; a put option for the resource; and any of the foregoing with regard to at least one of a substitute resource or a correlated resource.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the resource distribution circuit is further structured to determine at least one of a substitute resource or a correlated resource, and to further execute at least one transaction of the at least one of the substitute resource or the correlated resource.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the resource distribution circuit is further structured to execute the at least one transaction of the at least one of the substitute resource or the correlated resource as a replacement for the transaction of the resource.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the resource distribution circuit is further structured to execute the at least one transaction of the at least one of the substitute resource or the correlated resource in concert with the transaction of the resource.
14. A method, comprising: determining a first amount of a first resource for a machine to service at least one of a compute task requirement, a networking task requirement, and an energy consumption task requirement; accessing a forward resource market; accessing a resource market; and executing a transaction of the first resource on at least one of the resource market or the forward resource market in response to the determined amount of the first resource.
15. The method of claim 14, further comprising: determining a second amount of a second resource for the machine to service at least one of the compute task requirement, the networking task requirement, and the energy consumption task requirement; and executing a second transaction of the second resource on the other one of the resource market or the forward resource market.
16. The method of claim 14, further comprising determining at least one of a substitute resource or a correlated resource, and executing at least one transaction of the at least one of the substitute resource or the correlated resource.
17. The method of claim 16, further comprising executing the at least one transaction of the at least one of the substitute resource or the correlated resource as a replacement for the transaction of the first resource.
18. The method of claim 16, further comprising executing the at least one transaction of the at least one of the substitute resource or the correlated resource in concert with the transaction of the first resource.
19. The method of claim 17, wherein determining the correlated resource comprises at least one operation selected from the operations consisting of: determining the correlated resource for the machine as a resource to service alternate tasks that provide acceptable functionality for the machine; determining the correlated resource as a resource that is expected to be correlated with the first resource in regard to at least one of a price or an availability; and determining the correlated resource as a resource that is expected to have a corresponding price change with the first resource, such that a subsequent sale of the correlated resource combined with a spot market purchase of the first resource provides for a planned economic outcome.
