Grinding wheel assembly
</title>

<abstract>
A grinding wheel assembly is disclosed and includes an arbor in which a pull stud may be installed. Further, the arbor can include a head assembly that includes a mounting plate, a cover plate, and an abrasive body disposed there between. The abrasive is removably engaged with the mounting plate and the cover plate.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An abrasive article comprising: a body including: a mounting plate; and a cover plate, wherein the mounting plate and cover plate are configured to be coupled to each other and form a head assembly including a channel region established between the mounting plate and the cover plate; wherein the cover plate and the mounting plate are configured to be coupled with a clamping force across the channel region to hold an abrasive body within the channel region and the clamping force is provided by at least one fastener tightened with a torque, T, of at least 20 Newton meters (N●m); and wherein the cover plate comprises a generally cylindrical support hub extending axially from a contact surface of the cover plate, the support hub configured to extend into the abrasive body, and the contact surface of the cover plate configured to engage a portion of the abrasive body.
2. The abrasive article of claim 1, wherein T is at least 25 N●m.
3. The abrasive article of claim 2, wherein T is no greater than 60 N●m.
4. The abrasive article of claim 1, further comprising an arbor configured to be coupled to the mounting plate.
5. The abrasive article of claim 4, wherein the mounting plate is configured to be disposed between and directly contact the cover plate and the arbor in an assembled state.
6. The abrasive article of claim 5, wherein the arbor comprises a proximal end and a distal end, and wherein the proximal end comprises a central opening configured to be engaged with a pull stud.
7. The abrasive article of claim 5, wherein the arbor is integrally formed with the mounting plate.
8. The abrasive article of claim 1, wherein the mounting plate comprises a generally cylindrical mounting hub extending axially from a contact surface of the mounting plate, the contact surface of the mounting plate configured to engage a portion of an abrasive body and the mounting hub configured to receive the abrasive body there around.
9. The abrasive article of claim 7, wherein the cover plate comprises at least one bore radially offset from a central axis of the cover plate configured to receive the at least one fastener, and the mounting plate comprises at least one bore aligned with the at least one bore of the cover plate configured to receive the at least one fastener.
10. An abrasive article comprising: a body including: a mounting plate; and a cover plate, wherein the mounting plate and cover plate are configured to be coupled to each other and form a head assembly including a channel region disposed between the mounting plate and the cover plate, and further comprising a gap region defining a gap distance of at least 0.25 mm between the mounting plate and the cover plate in a pre-assembled state; an abrasive body disposed between the mounting plate and the cover plate, wherein the abrasive body includes an abrasive portion mounted on a backing, wherein the backing has a hardness, HB, and the cover plate has a hardness, HCP, and HB is less than HCP.
11. The abrasive article of claim 10, wherein the backing comprises a metal, metal alloy, or a composite material.
12. The abrasive article of claim 10, further comprising an arbor including a proximal end and a distal end, wherein the mounting plate is formed integrally with the arbor at or near the distal end or the arbor, wherein the proximal end comprises a central opening configured to be engaged with a pull stud.
13. The abrasive article of claim 10, wherein the backing comprises a metal, metal alloy, or a composite material.
14. The abrasive article of claim 10, wherein the abrasive portion has a thickness, TA, and the backing has a thickness, TB, and TB is greater than TA.
15. An abrasive article comprising: a body including: an arbor comprising a body defining a promixal end and a distal end, wherein the body of the arbor comprises a central flange that extends outwardly from the body and a mounting plate that extends radially outward from the body at or near the distal end of the body; and a cover plate, wherein the mounting plate and cover plate are configured to be coupled to each other and form a head assembly including a channel region disposed between the mounting plate and the cover plate, and further comprising a gap region defining a gap distance of at least 0.2 mm between the mounting plate and the cover plate in an assembled state.
16. The abrasive article of claim 15, further comprising multiple abrasive bodies disposed within the channel region between the mounting plate and the cover plate.
17. The abrasive article of claim 16, wherein the multiple abrasive bodies comprise a first abrasive body having a first abrasive grit size and a second abrasive body having a second abrasive grit size.
18. The abrasive article of claim 17, wherein the first abrasive grit size is different than the second abrasive grit size.
19. The abrasive article of claim 17, wherein the first abrasive body is separated from the second abrasive body by at least one spacer.
20. The abrasive article of claim 16, wherein the multiple abrasive bodies comprise a first abrasive body having a first outer profile and a second abrasive body having a second outer profile different from the first outer profile.
