<claims>
1. A system, comprising: a wearable appliance monitoring one or more body parameters, the appliance including a wrist-watch housing, a processor, a transceiver, an accelerometer and one or more heart monitoring sensors coupled to a back of the wrist-watch housing configured to be coupled to a wrist to detect vital sign, wherein the accelerometer detects user movement, and one or more additional sensors that detect body activity; a telephone having a positioning system and wirelessly coupled to the wearable appliance, the telephone off-loading at least a portion of speech processing from the processor of the wearable appliance; and a remote-server wirelessly coupled to the wearable appliance through the transceiver or the telephone.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein one of the additional sensor detects at least one of: ECG, heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation, posture, fall, or movement.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein at least one additional sensor determines heart rate, heart pulse, blood pressure, or oxygen level (SpO2).
4. The system of claim 1, comprising a second sensor in the wrist-watch housing coupled to the processor to sense mood or vital sign, wherein text, image, sound, or video is rendered in response to a sensed mood or vital sign.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the additional sensors in the wrist-watch housing are in communication with the processor to capture vital sign data; and an application executed by the processor to process the vital sign data and movement data detected by the accelerometer and a gyroscope.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein at least one additional sensor detects at least one of: ECG, heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation, patient posture, patient fall, or patient movement and wherein the wearable appliance communicates voice over a personal area network, a wireless local area network, or a cellular network.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the telephone or the wearable appliance communicates with a first device configured to provide data in a first protocol or standard from a first manufacturer and a second device configured to provide data in a second protocol or standard from a second manufacturer; and an electronic health record module configured to translate between the protocols or standards.
8. The system of claim 1, comprising a module to communicate wearable user data to a physician database or a hospital database.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor receives calorie, food consumption, exercise activity, or glucose level.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein at least one sensor data is used to select a fitness program targeted at a user.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor executes code to store and analyze information including posture, ambulation habits, medicine taking habits, eating and drinking habits, sleeping habits, or exercise habits.
12. A mobile system, comprising: a wearable device with a wrist-watch housing; a cellular, WiFi, and Bluetooth transceiver coupled to a processor; an accelerometer and a heart sensor coupled to the processor; wherein the wearable device includes at least one sensor coupled to a back of the wearable device and wherein the wearable device processes a speech command, the cellular transceiver off-loading at least a portion of speech processing to another processor.
13. The system of claim 12, comprising one or more electrodes that contact skin and capture bio-electrical signals; and an amplifier coupled to the electrodes.
14. The system of claim 12, wherein the sensor comprises an ECG sensor, an optical sensor, and a fall detector.
15. The system of claim 12, wherein the wearable device houses the one or more sensors to detect one or more of: ECG, heart rate, brain wave, respiration rate, blood pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation, posture, fall, or movement.
16. The system of claim 12, wherein the wearable device communicates with a first device configured to provide data in a first protocol or standard from a first manufacturer and a second device configured to provide data in a second protocol or standard from a second manufacturer; and an electronic health record module configured to translate between the protocols or standards.
17. The system of claim 12, wherein mood or body vital sign is used to select a fitness program targeted at a user.
18. A wrist-watch device, comprising: a wrist-watch housing; a processor; an accelerometer and a heart sensor coupled to the processor; a cellular transceiver coupled to the processor, the cellular transceiver off-loading at least a portion of speech processing to a remote processor; a display screen coupled to the processor; and a sensor coupled to a back of the wrist-watch housing to detect blood-oxygen level, heart rate or pulse rate, and wherein the processor processes a speech command.
19. The device of claim 18, wherein the processor communicates with a first device configured to provide data in a first protocol or standard from a first manufacturer and a second device configured to provide data in a second protocol or standard from a second manufacturer; and an electronic health record module configured to translate between the protocols or standards.
20. The device of claim 18, wherein the wrist watch housing encloses one or more sensors to detect the one or more of: ECG, heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation, posture, fall, or movement.
21. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor detects a fall based on sensor data.
22. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor detects one or more sequences of human motion or posture.
