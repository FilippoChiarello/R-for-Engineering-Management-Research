METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DETECTING ATTACKS ON MONITORED PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
A computer system and computer implemented method of detecting attacks on physical systems are disclosed. The system may include one or more databases and one or more controller configured to execute instructions. The instructions may include the following method steps: receiving at least one signal related to a monitored physical system; de-nosing the at least one signal to extract a smooth portion of the signal; detecting one or more states of the monitored physical system by analyzing the smooth proton of the signal; obtaining a noise portion of the signal by subtracting the de-noised smooth portion from the at least one signal; classifying the noise portion; determining expected states of the system based on the classified noise portion; comparing the expected states to the detected one or more states; and detecting an attack on the monitored physical system based on the comparison.

<claims>
1. A computer method for detecting attacks on physical systems, the method comprising: receiving at least one signal related to a monitored physical system; de-nosing the at least one signal to extract a smooth portion of the signal; detecting one or more states of the monitored physical system by analyzing the smooth proton of the signal; obtaining a noise portion of the signal by subtracting the de-noised smooth portion from the at least one signal; classifying the noise portion; determining one or more expected states of the system based on the classified noise portion; comparing the one or more expected states to the detected one or more states; and detecting an attack on the monitored physical system based on the comparison.
2. The computer method of claim 1, wherein classifying the noise portion comprises: comparing the noise portion to calcified fingerprints of noise portions stored in a database.
3. The computer method according to claim 1, further comprising: dividing the noise portion into desecrate segments, and wherein classifying the noise portion comprises classifying at least some of the desecrate segments.
4. The computer method of claim 1, further comprising dividing the noise portion into desecrate segments, wherein classifying the noise portion comprises classifying at least some of the desecrate segments, and wherein classifying the noise portion further comprises obtaining noise signal features from the desecrate segments.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the at least one signal related to a monitored physical system comprises at least one of: temperature, current, voltage, pressure, vibrations, strains, power, phase, and loads.
6. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: receiving a signal associated with a known state of the system; de-noising the received signal to extract a smooth portion of the signal and obtaining the noise portion of the signal; associating each one of the smooth portion of the signal and the noise portion of the signal with the known state of the system; and saving the noise portion of the signal associated the known state of the system in the database.
7. The computer method of claim 6, further comprising: saving the smooth portion of the signal associated the known state of the system in a database.
8. The computer method of claim 6, further comprising: generating a classification module based on the associated smooth and noise portions.
9. The computer method of claim 8, further comprising: updating the classification module with new associated smooth and noise portions.
10. The computer method according to claim 1, further comprising: receiving a set of signals related to a monitored physical system; identifying some of the signals in the set as authenticated signals; identifying at least one of the signals in the set to be un-authenticated signal; generating a first estimated signal for a of the at least one of the un-authenticated signal based on the identified authenticated signals; comparing the first estimated signal and the at least one un-authenticated signal; and detecting an attack on the monitored physical system based on the comparison.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the set of signals include two or more signals related to two or more different parameters of the monitored physical system.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein generating an estimated signal comprises generating a specific vector based on a regression model for each of the at least one of the un-authenticated signal based on the identified authenticated signals.
13. The method of claim 10, further comprises: identifying at least one signal from the set of signals as a potentially fake signal based on the compression between the first estimated signal and the at least one un-authenticated signal receiving one or more external signals from one or more sensors external to the monitored system; generating a second estimated signal for each of the at least one potentially fake signal based on the one or more external signals; comparing the second estimated signal and the at least one potentially fake signal; and detecting an attack on the monitored physical system based on the comparison.
14. A system for detecting attacks on physical systems, the system comprising: a processor configured to: receive at least one signal related to a monitored physical system; de-nose the at least one signal to extract a smooth portion of the signal; detect one or more states of the monitored physical system by analyzing the smooth signal; obtain a noise portion of the signal by subtracting the de-noised smooth portion from the at least one signal; classify the noise portion; determine expected states of the system based on the classified noise portion; compare the expected states to the detected one or more states; and detect an attack on the monitored physical system based on the comparison.
15. The system of claim 14, further comprising: a database, and wherein the processor is further configured to: compare the noise portion to calcified fingerprints of noise portions stored in the database.
