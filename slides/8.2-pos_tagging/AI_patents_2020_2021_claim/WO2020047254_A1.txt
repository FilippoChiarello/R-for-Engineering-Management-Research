NEURON CALCULATOR FOR ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS
</title>

<abstract>
Examples described herein include systems and methods, including wireless devices and systems with neuron calculators that may perform one or more functionalities of a wireless transceiver. The neuron calculator calculates output signals that may be implemented, for example, using accumulation units that sum the multiplicative processing results of ordered sets from ordered neurons with connection weights for each connection between an ordered neuron and outputs of the neuron calculator. The ordered sets may be a combination of some input signals, with the number of signals determined by an order of the neuron. Accordingly, a k th -order neuron may include an ordered set comprising product values of k input signals, where the input signals are selected from a set of kâ€‘combinations with repetition. As an example in a wireless transceiver, the neuron calculator may perform channel estimation as a channel estimation processing component of the receiver portion of a wireless transceiver.
