A SYSTEM FOR ITEM LOGISTICS AND A MOBILE CONTAINER OF BOXES USED IN THIS SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
This description provides a new faster item distribution logistics system with a mobile container of boxes allowing such system to be realized. A mobile container of boxes is equipped with a movement enabling technical measures and control system with artificial intelligence measures. A container controlled by such control system may be automatically loaded from the vehicle into the item delivery point and empty containers may be loaded back into the vehicle. Containers can also change the location in the vehicle and the delivery point to ensure the fastest exchange of containers between the vehicle and the delivery point. Due to the high level of automation, the system provides a faster and cheaper distribution and delivery of items from the warehouse to buyers of items than common distribution systems. Also, the for operation of such system less human workforce is needed.

<claims>
1. A method of optimizing the location of containers in a vehicle, comprising the steps of: automatically changing locations of containers in the vehicle to optimally locate the containers in the vehicle for a fastest possible next automatic unloading/loading wherein full containers unload automatically from the vehicle to a delivery point; and/or containers with empty boxes load automatically from the delivery point to the vehicle.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the containers are controlled by an electronic control system with artificial intelligence means installed, where the artificial intelligence means optimizes placement and exchange of containers between the vehicle and the delivery point by determining optimum location and movement trajectories and/or other motion parameters of the containers in the vehicle and the point.
3. The method according to claims 2, wherein the control system has the ability to continually learn and improve optimal location through feedback enabling the control system to monitor the actual duration for the exchange of containers and comparing them with the optimization results.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein the containers are equipped with technical means, enabling the movement of the containers on a horizontal plane and being connected to devices generating a torque force.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein a base of the containers consists of only vertical supports and the containers are transported from one location to another in the vehicle by a separate drive unit.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the drive unit passes between the supports of the containers without touching them, so that the drive unit can go to any container without spacing between the containers.
7. The method according to claim 2, wherein hardware of the electronic control system is placed into the container, if the drive unit is installed in the container; or separate from the container, if the drive unit is separated from the container; or partially in the container and partially in a separate device.
8. The method according to claim 1, wherein longitudinal rails and transverse rails perpendicular to the longitudinal ones are installed in a cargo compartment of the vehicle and connected in such a way that the containers can move on both rails and can move from the longitudinal rails to the transverse rails and/or vice versa.
9. An electronic control system with artificial intelligence means installed therein, adapted to carry out the method of claim 1.
10. A container comprising the electronic control system of claim 9.
11. A drive unit for transporting a container, the drive unit comprising the electronic control system of claim 9.
12. A delivery system, comprising: a vehicle with a cargo compartment; a delivery point; and at least one container (3) according to claim 10.
13. A delivery system, comprising: a vehicle with a cargo compartment; a delivery point; at least one container with a base consisting of only vertical supports; and at least a separate drive unit to transport the containers from one location to another in the vehicle.
14. A delivery system, comprising: a vehicle with a cargo compartment; a delivery point; at least one container; and an electronic control system according to claim 9, wherein the hardware of the electronic control system is placed partially in the container and partially in a separate device.
15. A delivery system, comprising: a vehicle with a cargo compartment; a delivery point; at least one container; means for automatically moving the at least one container in the vehicle, and from the vehicle to the delivery point and vice/versa; means for changing the position of the at least one container in the vehicle to optimally locate at least one container in the vehicle for the fastest possible next automatic unloading/loading; means for optimizing the placement and exchange of containers between vehicle and delivery point by determining optimum location and movement trajectories and/or other motion parameters of the containers in the vehicle and the point; means for monitoring the actual duration for the exchange of containers; means for comparing the actual duration for the exchange of containers with the optimization results from the means for optimizing; and means for continually learning and improving the optimal location through the feedback from the means for comparing.
