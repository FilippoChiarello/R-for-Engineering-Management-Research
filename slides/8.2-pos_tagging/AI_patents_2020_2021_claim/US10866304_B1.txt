<title>
Signal detection and denoising systems
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein are systems and methods for estimating target ranges, angles of arrival, and speed using optimization procedures. Target ranges are estimated by performing an optimization procedure to obtain a denoised signal, performing a correlation of a transmitted waveform and the denoised signal, and using a result of the correlation to determine an estimate of a distance between the sensor and at least one target. Target angles of arrival are estimated by determining ranges at which targets are located, and, for each range, constructing an array signal from samples of received echo signals, and using the array signal, performing another optimization procedure to estimate a respective angle of arrival for each target of the at least one target. Doppler shifts may also be estimated using another optimization procedure. Certain of the optimization procedures use atomic norm techniques.
