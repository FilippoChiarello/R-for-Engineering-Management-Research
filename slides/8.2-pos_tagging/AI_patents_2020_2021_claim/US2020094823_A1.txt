<title>
LOCATION PREDICTION FOR DYNAMIC OBJECTS
</title>

<abstract>
A control system and a method for predicting a location of dynamic objects, for example, of pedestrians, which are able to be detected by the sensors of a vehicle. The control system includes a multitude of sensors and a processing system, which is configured to combine with a first program the objects that are detected by the multitude of sensors to form an object list, each entry of the object list encompassing the location, a speed and an open route for each of the objects, and the object list including a time stamp; and to determine with a second program for at least a portion of the dynamic objects an additional object list from a predefined number of object lists, the additional object list including a time stamp for a future point in time and encompassing at least the location of the dynamic objects.

<claims>
1. 1-12. (canceled)
13. A control system for predicting a location of dynamic objects, comprising: a multitude of sensors; a processing system, which is configured to combine with the aid of a first program the objects, which are detected by the multitude of sensors, to form an object list, wherein each entry of the object list encompasses the location, a speed and an open route for each of the objects, and the object list including a time stamp; and determining an additional object list for at least a portion of the dynamic objects from a predefined number of object lists with a second program, wherein the additional object list includes a time stamp for a future point in time and encompasses at least the location of the dynamic objects.
14. A method for predicting a location of dynamic objects, the method comprising: detecting the objects with a multitude of sensors; combining the objects with a first program to form an object list, wherein each entry of the object list encompasses the location, a speed and an open route for each of the objects, and the object list includes a time stamp; and determining for at least a portion of the dynamic objects an additional object list from a predefined number of object lists with a second program, wherein the additional object list includes a time stamp for a future point in time and encompasses at least the location of the dynamic objects.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the second program uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) methodology.
16. The method of claim 14, wherein the second program uses social long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.
17. The method of claim 14, wherein each entry of the object list also encompasses a probability.
18. The method of claim 14, wherein the location, at least for a portion of the objects, is represented as a bivariate normal distribution.
19. The method of claim 14, wherein distances, at least for a portion of the objects, are represented logarithmically.
20. The method of claim 14, wherein the time stamp includes an interval of 10 ms to 500 ms.
21. The method of claim 14, wherein the object list represents a tensor.
22. A non-transitory computer-readable medium having a computer program, which is executable in a processing system, comprising: a program code arrangement having program code for predicting a location of dynamic objects, by performing the following: detecting the objects with a multitude of sensors; combining the objects with a first program to form an object list, wherein each entry of the object list encompasses the location, a speed and an open route for each of the objects, and the object list includes a time stamp; and determining for at least a portion of the dynamic objects an additional object list from a predefined number of object lists with a second program, wherein the additional object list includes a time stamp for a future point in time and encompasses at least the location of the dynamic objects.
23. The computer-readable medium of claim 22, wherein the second program uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) methodology.
24. An apparatus for predicting a location of dynamic objects, comprising: a device which is configured to perform the following: detecting the objects with a multitude of sensors; combining the objects with a first program to form an object list, wherein each entry of the object list encompasses the location, a speed and an open route for each of the objects, and the object list includes a time stamp; and determining for at least a portion of the dynamic objects an additional object list from a predefined number of object lists with a second program, wherein the additional object list includes a time stamp for a future point in time and encompasses at least the location of the dynamic objects.
25. The method of claim 14, wherein the time stamp includes an interval of 50 ms to 200 ms.
