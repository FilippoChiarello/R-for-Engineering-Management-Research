MANUFACTURING PROCESS CONTROL USING CONSTRAINED REINFORCEMENT MACHINE LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
For manufacturing process control, closed-loop control is provided (18) based on a constrained reinforcement learned network (32). The reinforcement is constrained (22) to account for the manufacturing application. The constraints may be for an amount of change, limits, or other factors reflecting capabilities of the controlled device and/or safety.

<claims>
I (WE) CLAIM:
1. A method for manufacturing process control with a controller, the method comprising:
determining (10) a state of the manufacturing process of a
manufacturing plant;
setting (12) a manipulated variable of a controlled device of the manufacturing process, the setting (12) being based on an action output by a reinforcement machine-learned network (32) in response to input of the state, the reinforcement machine-learned network (32) incorporating a constraint of the manufacturing process; and
operating (18) the manufacturing plant with the manipulated variable of the manufacturing process as set.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein determining (10) the state comprises determining (10) a current value of the manipulated variable, a set point for a controlled variable responsive to the current value of the manipulated variable, and a current value of the controlled variable, and wherein setting (12) comprises setting (12) in response to input of the current values of the manipulated and controlled variables and the set point.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein setting (12) comprises setting (12) the manipulated variable based on the action output according to a learned policy of the reinforcement machine-learned network (32).
4. The method of claim 1 wherein setting (12) comprises setting (12) based on an action policy learned by the reinforcement machine-learned network (32), the action policy comprising a look-up table or a neural network.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the constraint incorporated into the reinforcement machine-learned network (32) comprises a reward function to suppress a change based on an amount of change in the setting (12).
6. The method of claim 1 wherein the constraint incorporated into the reinforcement machine-learned network (32) comprises a limit on an amount of change of the setting (12) of the manipulated variable.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein the constraint incorporated into the reinforcement machine-learned network (32) comprises a maximum, a minimum, or both of the setting (12) of the manipulated variable.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein the constraint incorporated into the reinforcement machine-learned network (32) comprises a maximum, a minimum, or both of a value of a controlled variable responsive to the setting (12) of the manipulated variable in the manufacturing process.
9. The method of claim 1 wherein the constraint incorporated into the reinforcement machine-learned network (32) comprises an operational limitation of a valve, actuator, or motor.
10. The method of claim 1 wherein the constraint incorporated into the reinforcement machine-learned network (32) comprises a reward function to reward based on a reference trajectory.
11. The method of claim 1 wherein setting (12) comprises setting (12) by the controller.
12. A control system for manufacturing process control, the control system comprising:
sensors (36) configured to sense a state of a manufacturing system; and
a controller (30) configured to determine a change in a device (37) from a reinforcement machine-learned action policy based on the state, the reinforcement machine-learned action policy having used rewards based in part on a limitation of the device.
13. The control system of claim 12 wherein the limitation is an amount of change, a reward weight for the change, a minimum, or maximum.
14. The control system of claim 12 wherein the limitation is a reward weight for a trajectory.
15. A method for reinforcement learning (28) in a manufacturing system, the method comprising:
machine learning (28) closed-loop control of the manufacturing system with reinforcement learning (28), the reinforcement learning optimizing a reward or cost function;
subjecting (22) the optimizing of the reinforcement learning to a constraint of the manufacturing system; and
storing (31 ) a machine-learned network (32) from the machine learning for a control system of the manufacturing system.
16. The method of claim 15 wherein subjecting (22) comprises subjecting (22) to a limit on an amount of change.
17. The method of claim 15 wherein subjecting (22) comprises subjecting (22) a control variable of the manufacturing system to a maximum, minimum, or both.
18. The method of claim 15 wherein subjecting (22) comprises subjecting (22) a set point variable of the manufacturing system to a maximum, minimum, or both.
19. The method of claim 15 wherein the machine learning (28) occurs during manufacturing by the manufacturing system.
20. The method of claim 15 wherein the optimizing uses a constrained optimization solver.
