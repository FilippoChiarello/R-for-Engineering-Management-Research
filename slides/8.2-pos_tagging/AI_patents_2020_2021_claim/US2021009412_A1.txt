METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROCESSING OF MATERIALS USING HIGH-TEMPERATURE TORCH
</title>

<abstract>
A method and apparatus for reforming carbonaceous material into syngas containing hydrogen and CO gases is disclosed. In one embodiment, a hydrogen rich torch reactor is provided for defining a reaction zone proximate to torch flame. One input of the reactor receives input material to be processed. Further inputs may be provided, such as for example to introduce steam and/or gases such as methane, oxygen, hydrogen, or the like.

<claims>
1. An apparatus for processing input material, comprising: a reactor vessel defining a combustion zone; the reactor vessel having at least one input for a combustible torch fuel to at least one torch nozzle, the at least one torch nozzle being adapted to generate at least one flame within said reactor; the reactor vessel further having at least one input port for receiving the input feedstock, the input feedstock being directed proximally to the at least one flame; the reactor vessel further having an output for discharging a primary reactor output stream; at least one cooler coupled to receive the primary reactor output stream and operable to cool the primary reactor output stream and generate a secondary output stream; a scrubber, coupled to receive the secondary output stream from the cooler/separator, the scrubber being operable to further extract at least one gas from the secondary output stream.
2. An apparatus in accordance with claim 1, wherein the reactor vessel further has an input for receiving a supply of steam.
3. An apparatus in accordance with claim 1, wherein the combustible torch fuel comprises hydrogen.
4. An apparatus in accordance with claim 2, wherein the combustible torch fuel further comprises methane.
5. An apparatus in accordance with claim 1, wherein the combustible torch fuel is combined with oxygen.
6. An apparatus in accordance with claim 1, wherein the combustible torch fuel comprises acetylene.
7. An apparatus in accordance with claim 1, wherein the reactor vessel further having at least one input port for receiving the input feedstock, the input feedstock being selectively directed proximally to the tip of at least one flame and intersecting that flame at angle of 90 degrees plus or minus 60 degrees.
8. An apparatus in accordance with claim 1, wherein the at least one cooler further is further operable to precipitate solid impurities from the primary reactor output stream.
9. An apparatus in accordance with claim 1, wherein the combustible torch fuel comprises less than ten percent (10%) nitrogen.
10. An apparatus in accordance with claim 1, further comprising a preheater for preheating the input feedstock prior to introduction into the reactor vessel.
11. A method for processing input material, comprising: directing an input feedstock into a reactor vessel having at least one input for a combustible torch fuel to at least one torch nozzle, the at least one torch nozzle being adapted to generate at least one flame within said reactor to define a combustion zone; directing a primary output stream from said reactor vessel into at least one cooler operable to cool the primary reactor output stream and generate a secondary output stream; directing the secondary output stream from the at least one cooler into a scrubber, the scrubber being operable to extract at least one gas from the secondary output stream.
12. A method in accordance with claim 11, further comprising introducting steam into the reactor vessel.
13. An method in accordance with claim 11, wherein the combustible torch fuel comprises hydrogen.
14. A method in accordance with claim 13, wherein the combustible torch fuel further comprises methane.
15. A method in accordance with claim 13, wherein the combustible torch fuel is combined with oxygen.
16. A method in accordance with claim 13, further comprising selectively directing the input feedstock proximally to the tip of at least one flame and intersecting that flame at angle of 90 degrees plus or minus 60 degrees.
17. A method in accordance with claim 13, wherein the scrubber is further operable to precipitate solid impurities from the primary reactor output stream.
18. A method in accordance with claim 11, wherein the combustible torch fuel comprises less than ten percent (10%) nitrogen.
19. A method in accordance with claim 11, further comprising preheating the input feedstock prior to directing the input feedstock into the reactor vessel.
