<title>
Cancellation of a baseline current signal via current subtraction within a linear relaxation oscillator-based current-to-frequency converter circuit
</title>

<abstract>
This disclosure relates to systems and/or methods for subtracting in the current domain an output current primary signal from a primary sensor from an output current reference signal from a reference sensor to produce a frequency output signal indicative of the difference between the output current primary signal and the output current reference signal.

<claims>
1. A device comprising: a first sensor adapted to produce a first current signal during measurement of at least one parameter, wherein the first current signal includes a measurement current signal associated with the at least one parameter and a baseline current signal; a second sensor adapted to produce a second current signal during the measurement of the at least one parameter, wherein the second current signal is indicative of the baseline current signal and not the measurement current signal associated with the at least one parameter; and a converter comprising an integration capacitor and a switching mechanism, wherein the integration capacitor has a first terminal connected to the first and second sensors via the switching mechanism, wherein the converter is adapted to produce an output signal indicative of a net current corresponding to a difference between the first current signal and the second current signal, wherein the output signal comprises at least a charging phase and a discharging phase, wherein during the charging phase the switching mechanism connects the integration capacitor to the first and second sensors such that the net current flows into the integration capacitor, and wherein during the discharging phase the switching mechanism connects the integration capacitor to the first and second sensors such that the net current flows out from the integration capacitor.

9. The device of claim 1, wherein the switching mechanism is controlled by a feedback voltage derived from a voltage on the integration capacitor.
10. The device of claim 1, wherein the switching mechanism comprises a plurality of switches.
11. The device of claim 10, wherein the plurality of switches includes a first switch configured to connect a current output of the first sensor to the integration capacitor, a second switch configured to connect a current output of the second sensor to the integration capacitor, a third switch configured to connect a current input of the first sensor to the integration capacitor, and a fourth switch configured to connect a current input of the second sensor to the integration capacitor.
12. The device of claim 1, wherein the baseline current signal varies over time.
13. The device of claim 1, wherein the baseline current signal is dependent on temperature.
