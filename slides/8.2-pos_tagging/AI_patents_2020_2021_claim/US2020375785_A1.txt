TOOLS AND METHODS FOR PLACING A MEDICAL APPLIANCE ON A USER
</title>

<abstract>
A method for operating an accessory device to guide the placement of an ostomy appliance on a user having a stoma. The method can include capturing an image or a sequence of images of the user applying the ostomy appliance to the user's body, processing the captured image or sequence of images, including: identifying a location of the stoma in one or more of the captured image or sequence of images, identifying a location of the ostomy appliance in one or more of the captured image or sequence of images, and generating location indicia representative of the location of the ostomy appliance with respect to the stoma in one or more of the captured image or sequence of images. A visual display including the location indicia associated with one or more of the captured image or sequence of images can be provided.

<claims>
1. A method for operating an accessory device to guide the placement of medical appliance on a user having a stoma, comprising: capturing an image or a sequence of images of the user applying the medical appliance to the user's body; processing the captured image or sequence of images, including: identifying a location of the stoma in one or more of the captured image or sequence of images; identifying a location of the medical appliance in one or more of the captured image or sequence of images; and generating location indicia representative of the location of the medical appliance with respect to the stoma in one or more of the captured image or sequence of images; and providing a visual display including the location indicia associated with one or more of the captured image or sequence of images.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein: generating the location indicia includes: generating a stoma location representation; and generating an appliance location representation; and providing the visual display includes providing a visual display including the stoma location representation and the appliance location representation.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein generating and displaying the stoma location representation includes generating and displaying a graphical simulation of the stoma.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein generating and displaying the appliance location representation includes generating and displaying a graphical simulation of the medical appliance.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein generating and displaying the appliance location representation includes generating and displaying an image of at least a portion of the actual medical appliance from one or more of the captured image or sequence of images.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein: generating the location indicia includes generating a quality indicator representative of the position of the medical appliance with respect to a desired position with respect to the stoma; and providing a visual display includes providing a visual display of the quality indicator.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein: generating the location indicia includes generating a direction indicator representative of a direction the medical appliance should be moved to locate the medical appliance at a desired position with respect to the stoma; and providing the visual display includes providing a visual display of the direction indicator.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein providing a visual display includes providing visual display of target indicia representative of a desired position of the medical appliance on the user.
9. The method of claim 1, and further including receiving calibration data representative of the location of the stoma on the user's body with respect to a reference indicator on the user's body that is visible in one or more of the captured image or sequence of images.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein: processing the captured image or sequence of images further includes identifying the reference indicator on the user's body; and identifying the location of the stoma includes identifying the location of the stoma as a function of the identified reference indicator on the user's body and the calibration data.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying the location of the medical appliance includes identifying a reference indicator on the medical appliance.
12. The method of claim 1, to guide the placement of an medical appliance including a base plate and bag attached to the base plate, wherein the base plate is not visible in the captured image or sequence of captured images.
13. The method of claim 1, to guide the placement of a base plate of a multi-piece medical appliance including a bag attachable to the base plate after the base plate is placed on the user's body.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein capturing the image or sequence of images, processing the captured image or sequence of images and providing the visual display are performed by an accessory device including a camera, image processor and display device.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying the location of the stoma in one or more of the captured image or sequence of images and/or identifying the location of the medical appliance in one or more of the captured image or sequence of images is performed using machine learning.
16. An accessory device including a camera, image processor, display and stored instructions for performing the method of claim 1.
17. Storage media with stored instructions for performing the method of claim1.
