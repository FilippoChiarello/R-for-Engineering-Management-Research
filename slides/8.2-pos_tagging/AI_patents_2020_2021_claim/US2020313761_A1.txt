RELAY DEVICE AND COMPUTER-READABLE STORAGE MEDIA
</title>

<abstract>
A relay device is provided for relaying communication between a radio base station and a communication terminal, which includes a relay function management unit to switch on or off a relay function for relaying communication between the radio base station and the communication terminal, and a change command transmission unit to transmit, to the communication terminal, a change command of a handover threshold for the communication terminal which has established a wireless communication connection with the relay device in a case where the relay function management unit switches off the relay function.

<claims>
1. A relay device for relaying communication between a radio base station and a communication terminal, comprising: a terminal communication unit which performs wireless communication with the communication terminal by an output radio wave from an antenna; a relay function management unit which switches on or off of a relay function for relaying communication between the radio base station and the communication terminal; and a radio wave intensity change unit which gradually reduces an intensity of the output radio wave from the antenna in a case where the relay function management unit switches off the relay function.
2. The relay device according to claim 1, wherein the radio wave intensity change unit gradually reduces the intensity of the output radio wave from the antenna until receiving information, which indicates a request of the communication terminal for a handover from the relay device, from the communication terminal which has established a wireless communication connection with the relay device.
3. The relay device according to claim 1, wherein the radio wave intensity change unit gradually reduces the intensity of the output radio wave from the antenna until receiving a measurement report of a radio wave, which is received by the communication terminal, from the communication terminal which has established a wireless communication connection with the relay device.
4. The relay device according to claim 2, wherein the radio wave intensity change unit gradually reduces the intensity of the output radio wave from the antenna until receiving information, which indicates a request of the communication terminal for a handover from the relay device, from all of the communication terminals which have established a wireless communication connection with the relay device.
5. The relay device according to claim 1, wherein the relay function management unit switches off the relay function after the radio wave intensity change unit gradually reduces the intensity of the output radio wave from the antenna and then the communication terminal is handed over from the relay device.
6. The relay device according to claim 5, wherein the relay function management unit switches off the relay function after the radio wave intensity change unit gradually reduces the intensity of the output radio wave from the antenna and then all of the communication terminals, which have established a wireless communication connection with the relay device, are handed over from the relay device.
7. The relay device according to claim 1, wherein the radio wave intensity change unit gradually reduces the intensity of the output radio wave from the antenna in a case where there is a communication terminal which has established a wireless communication connection with the relay device, and the relay function management unit is to switch off the relay function.
8. The relay device according to claim 1, wherein the radio wave intensity change unit increases a reduction amount in each stage in which the intensity of the output radio wave from the antenna is gradually reduced, as a radio wave reception intensity from the communication terminal, which has established a wireless communication connection with the relay device, becomes higher.
9. The relay device according to claim 1, wherein the radio wave intensity change unit decreases a reduction amount in each stage in which the intensity of the output radio wave from the antenna is gradually reduced, as a radio wave reception intensity from the communication terminal, which has established a wireless communication connection with the relay device, becomes lower.
10. The relay device according to claim 1, wherein the relay device is mounted in a moving body.
11. The relay device according to claim 10, further comprising: an estimation unit which monitors a state of the moving body during a period when the relay function is on to estimate whether the relay function is to be turned off, wherein the radio wave intensity change unit gradually reduces the intensity of the output radio wave from the antenna when the estimation unit estimates that the relay function is to be turned off.
12. The relay device according to claim 11, wherein the estimation unit estimates that the relay function is to be turned off in a case where a moving speed of the moving body satisfies a predetermined condition.
13. The relay device according to claim 12, wherein the estimation unit estimates that the relay function is to be turned off in a case where the moving speed of the moving body is slower than a predetermined speed.
14. The relay device according to claim 11, wherein the estimation unit estimates that the relay function is to be turned off in a case where a power OFF operation of the moving body is detected.
15. The relay device according to claim 11, wherein the moving body is a vehicle, and wherein the estimation unit estimates that the relay function is to be turned off in a case where an ignition OFF operation of the vehicle is detected.
16. A non-transitory computer-readable storage media for storing a program, wherein the program causes the computer, which relays communication between a radio base station and a communication terminal, to function as: a terminal communication unit which performs a wireless communication with the communication terminal by an output radio wave from an antenna, a relay function management unit which switches on or off a relay function for relaying communication between the radio base station and the communication terminal, and a radio wave intensity change unit which gradually reduces an intensity of the output radio wave from the antenna in a case where the relay function management unit switches off the relay function.
