<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for reducing expression of a target α-1 antitrypsin gene in a mammalian cell comprising contacting a mammalian cell in vitro with a double stranded nucleic acid (dsNA) comprising a sense strand and an antisense strand, wherein the antisense strand is 22 nucleotides in length, wherein the antisense strand has a region that is perfectly complementary to a contiguous sequence of α-1 antitrypsin mRNA consisting of 20 nucleotides in length, which contiguous sequence comprises a target α-1 antitrypsin mRNA sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1547, and wherein the dsNA comprises one or more modified nucleotides, in an amount sufficient to reduce expression of a target α-1 antitrypsin mRNA in said cell.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein target α-1 antitrypsin mRNA expression is reduced by an amount (expressed by %) selected from the group consisting of at least 10%, at least 50% and at least 80-90%.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein α-1 antitrypsin mRNA levels are reduced by an amount (expressed by %) of at least 90% at least 8 days after said cell is contacted with said dsNA.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein α-1 antitrypsin mRNA levels are reduced by an amount (expressed by %) of at least 70% at least 10 days after said cell is contacted with said dsNA.
5. A method for reducing expression of a target α-1 antitrypsin mRNA in a mammal comprising administering a nucleic acid comprising an oligonucleotide strand consisting of 22 nucleotides in length, wherein the oligonucleotide strand has a region that is perfectly complementary to a contiguous sequence of α-1 antitrypsin mRNA consisting of 20 nucleotides in length, which contiguous sequence comprises a target α-1 antitrypsin mRNA sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1547, and wherein the nucleic acid comprises one or more modified nucleotides, to a mammal in an amount sufficient to reduce expression of a target α-1 antitrypsin mRNA in the mammal.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein said nucleic acid is formulated in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP).
7. The method of claim 5, wherein said nucleic acid is administered at a dosage selected from the group consisting of 1 microgram to 5 milligrams per kilogram of said mammal per day, 100 micrograms to 0.5 milligrams per kilogram of said mammal per day, 0.001 to 0.25 milligrams per kilogram of said mammal per day, 0.01 to 20 micrograms per kilogram of said mammal per day, 0.01 to 10 micrograms per kilogram of said mammal per day, 0.10 to 5 micrograms per kilogram of said mammal per day, and 0.1 to 2.5 micrograms per kilogram of said mammal per day.
8. The method of claim 5, wherein said nucleic acid possesses greater potency than 21mer siRNAs directed to the identical at least 20 nucleotides of said target α-1 antitrypsin mRNA in reducing target α-1 antitrypsin mRNA expression when assayed in vitro in a mammalian cell at an effective concentration in the environment of a cell of 1 nanomolar or less.
9. The method of claim 5, wherein α-1 antitrypsin mRNA levels are reduced in a tissue of said mammal by an amount (expressed by %) of at least 70% at least 3 days after said dsNA is administered to said mammal.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein said tissue is liver tissue.
11. The method of claim 5, wherein said administering step comprises a mode selected from the group consisting of intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, intraperitoneal injection, infusion, subcutaneous injection, transdermal, aerosol, rectal, vaginal, topical, oral and inhaled delivery.
12. A method for treating or preventing a liver or lung disease or disorder in a subject comprising administering to said subject a nucleic acid comprising an oligonucleotide strand consisting of 22 nucleotides in length, wherein the oligonucleotide strand has a region that is perfectly complementary to target α-1 antitrypsin mRNA consisting of 20 nucleotides in length, which contiguous sequence comprises a target α-1 antitrypsin mRNA sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1547, and wherein the nucleic acid comprises one or more modified nucleotides, wherein said liver disease or disorder is selected from the group consisting of chronic liver disease, liver inflammation, cirrhosis, liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and said lung disease or disorder is selected from the group consisting of emphysema, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and cirrhosis.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein said subject is human.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the dsNA comprises a duplex of 20 to 25 base pairs in length.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein the dsNA comprises one or more phosphorothioate linkages.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein one or more modified nucleotides are selected from a 2′-O-methyl nucleotide and a 2′-fluoro nucleotide.
17. The method of claim 1, wherein the sense strand comprises a tetraloop at its 3′ end.
18. A method for treating or preventing a liver or lung disease or disorder in a subject comprising administering to said subject a double stranded nucleic acid (dsNA) comprising a sense strand and an antisense strand, wherein the antisense strand is 22 nucleotides in length, wherein the antisense strand has a region that is perfectly complementary to a contiguous sequence of α-1 antitrypsin mRNA consisting of 20 nucleotides in length, which contiguous sequence comprises a target α-1 antitrypsin mRNA sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1547, and wherein the dsNA comprises one or more modified nucleotides, wherein said liver disease or disorder is selected from the group consisting of chronic liver disease, liver inflammation, cirrhosis, liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and said lung disease or disorder is selected from the group consisting of emphysema, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and cirrhosis.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the dsNA comprises a duplex of 20 to 25 base pairs in length.
20. The method of claim 18, wherein the dsNA comprises one or more phosphorothioate linkages.
21. The method of claim 18, wherein one or more modified nucleotides are selected from a 2′-O-methyl nucleotide and a 2′-fluoro nucleotide.
22. The method of claim 18, wherein the sense strand comprises a tetraloop at its 3′ end.
