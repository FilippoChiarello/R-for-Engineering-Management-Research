METHOD AND DEVICES FOR FITTING A GARMENT ONTO A BODY
</title>

<abstract>
For fitting a garment onto a body, a training dataset of fitted garments is generated (S1) by a computer system fitting 3D representations of garments from a garment dataset onto 3D representations of bodies from a body dataset. The trained neural network is generated by training (S2) a neural network to fit a plurality of garments onto a plurality of bodies, using the training dataset. A selection of a particular garment and a particular body are received from a user of a communication terminal, which particular garment and which particular body are not in the training dataset. The particular garment is fitted (S4) onto the particular body using the trained neural network and shown on a display of the com- munication terminal.
