STYLE TRANSFER
</title>

<abstract>
Various implementations of the present disclosure relate to style transfer. In some implementations, a computer-implemented method comprises: obtaining a target object having a first style, a style of the target object being editable; obtaining a reference image including a reference object; obtaining a second style of the reference object, the second style of the reference object being extracted from the reference image; and applying the second style to the target object.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising:
obtaining a target object having a first style, the style of the target object being editable;
obtaining a reference image comprising a reference object;
obtaining a second style of the reference object, the second style of the reference object being extracted from the reference image; and
applying the second style to the target object.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the second style of the reference object is extracted from the reference image by a neural network.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the reference image is converted to a representation of the reference image by an encoder, and wherein the representation of the reference image is converted to the second style of the reference object by a decoder.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the representation of the reference image is converted to a plurality of elements of the second style by a plurality of decoders, respectively.
5. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the second style of the reference object is extracted by a predefined rule.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the reference object and the target object each include at least one of chart and table.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
displaying the target object having the second style; and
in response to receiving an editing operation on the displayed target object having the second style, modifying the second style of the target object.
8. A device comprising:
a processing unit; and
a memory coupled to the processing unit and including instructions stored thereon, the instructions, when executed by the processing unit, causing the device to perform acts comprising:
obtaining a target object having a first style, the style of the target object being editable;
obtaining a reference image comprising a reference object;
obtaining a second style of the reference object, the second style of the reference object being extracted from the reference image; and applying the second style to the target object.
9. The device of claim 8, wherein the second style of the reference object is extracted from the reference image by a neural network.
10. The device of claim 9, wherein the reference image is converted to a representation of the reference image by an encoder, and wherein the representation of the reference image is converted to the second style of the reference object by a decoder.
11. The device of claim 10, wherein the representation of the reference image is converted to a plurality of elements of the second style by a plurality of decoders, respectively.
12. The device of claim 8 or 9, wherein the second style of the reference object is extracted by a predefined rule.
13. The device of claim 8, wherein the reference object and the target object each include at least one of chart and table.
14. The device of claim 8, wherein the acts further comprise:
displaying the target object having the second style; and
in response to receiving an editing operation on the displayed target object having the second style, modifying the second style of the target object.
15. A computer program product being stored on a computer storage medium and comprising machine-executable instructions, the machine-executable instructions, when executed by a device, causing the device to perform acts comprising:
obtaining a target object having a first style, the style of the target object being editable;
obtaining a reference image comprising a reference object;
obtaining a second style of the reference object, the second style of the reference object being extracted from the reference image; and
applying the second style to the target object.
