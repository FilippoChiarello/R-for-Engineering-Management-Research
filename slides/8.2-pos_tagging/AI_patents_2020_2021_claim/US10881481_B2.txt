</abstract>

<claims>
We claim:
1. A system for global alignment of a spine during spinal surgery, the system comprising an imaging device, a spatial tracking system, a rod bending device, a mobile hand held communication device configured to calculate one or more cervical parameters based on identification of spinal markers in a preoperative image, wherein the spinal markers correspond to (i) cervical vertebrae and (ii) the first thoracic vertebra, and a control unit configured to: receive the one or more cervical parameters; receive a planned target value of one or more spinal parameters; based on the planned target value of the one or more spinal parameters, determine one or more ranges corresponding to a desired correction in at least one of (i) a sagittal alignment and (ii) a coronal alignment of the spine; capture, via the imaging device, one or more intraoperative fluoroscopy images; measure an intraoperative value of the one or more spinal parameters according to the one or more captured intraoperative fluoroscopy images; compare the intraoperative value of the one or more spinal parameters with the planned target value of the spinal parameters and the one or more cervical parameters; based on the comparison, determine that the intraoperative value of the one or more spinal parameters is within the one or more ranges and receive, via the spatial tracking system, a measurement of a location of one or more screws; and calculate an instruction to bend a rod, via the rod bending device, to the location of the one or more screws.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the control unit is further configured to: locate a point on the brow, locate a point on the chin, calculate a line between the points, and calculate an angle between the line and a vertical axis.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the control unit is further configured to: calculate a preoperative value of the one or more spinal parameters.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the control unit is further configured to: calculate a second target value for the one or more spinal parameters based on the comparison of the intraoperative value with the planned target value.
5. A system for use during a surgical procedure, the system comprising: an imaging device; a rod bending device; a mobile hand held communication device configured to calculate one or more cervical parameters based on identification of spinal markers in a preoperative image, wherein the spinal markers correspond to (i) cervical vertebrae and (ii) the first thoracic vertebra; a control unit configured to: obtain one or more preoperative measurements of an anatomical parameter of a patient and the one or more cervical parameters; obtain one or more planned target measurements of the anatomical parameter; obtain an intraoperative image from the imaging device; measure an intraoperative measurement of the anatomical parameter according to the intraoperative image; compare the intraoperative measurement of the anatomical parameter with the one or more planned target measurements of the anatomical parameter and the one or more cervical parameters; based on the comparison, determine that the intraoperative measurement of the anatomical parameter is within one or more ranges corresponding to a desired correction in at least one of (i) a sagittal alignment and (ii) a coronal alignment of the spine; and calculate an instruction for bending a surgical rod.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the anatomical parameter is a chin brow vertical angle.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the chin brow axis is an angle of a patient's gaze relative to a horizontal position.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the control unit displays to a user a color indication of the angle of the gaze.
9. The system of claim 5, wherein the anatomical parameter is a parameter correlated to a health related quality of life score.
10. The system of claim 5, wherein the anatomical parameter is a parameter correlated to the alignment of a patient's head over the patient's pelvis.
11. A method for assessing global alignment of a spine during a surgical procedure, the method comprising: inputting a planned target value of one or more spinal parameters into a control unit; providing one or more cervical parameters based on identification of spinal markers in a preoperative image to the control unit, wherein the spinal markers correspond to (i) cervical vertebrae and (ii) the first thoracic vertebra; providing one or more intraoperative fluoroscopy images to the control unit; measuring an intraoperative value of the one or more spinal parameters according to the one or more intraoperative fluoroscopy images; comparing the intraoperative value of the one or more spinal parameters with the planned target value of the spinal parameters and the one or more cervical parameters; based on the comparison, determining that the intraoperative value of one or more spinal parameters is within one or more ranges corresponding to a desired correction in at least one of (i) a sagittal alignment and (ii) a coronal alignment of the spine; measuring a location of one or more screws; calculating an instruction to bend a rod to the location of the one or more screws; and bending the rod according to the instruction.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein at least one of the spinal parameters is a chin brow vertical angle.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the method further comprises locating a point on the brow, locating a point on the chin, calculating a line between the points, and calculating an angle between the line and a vertical axis.
14. The method of claim 11 further comprising, calculating a preoperative value of the one or more spinal parameters.
15. The method of claim 11 further comprising, calculating a second target value for the one or more spinal parameters based on the comparison of the intraoperative value with the planned target value.
16. The method of claim 11, wherein at least one of the spinal parameters is a parameter correlated to a health related quality of life score.
17. The method of claim 11, wherein the spinal parameter is a parameter correlated to the alignment of a patient's head over the patient's pelvis.
18. The method of claim 11, wherein at least one of the spinal parameters is cervical sagittal vertical axis.
19. The method of claim 11, wherein at least one of the spinal parameters is T1 slope.
20. The method of claim 11, wherein at least one of the spinal parameters is cervical lordosis.
