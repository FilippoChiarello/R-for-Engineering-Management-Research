<title>
User interface control of responsive devices
</title>

<abstract>
Among other things, a user interface device has a sensor configured to detect, at a wrist of a human, nerve or other tissue electrical signals associated with an intended contraction of a muscle to cause a rapid motion of a finger. An output provides information representative of the nerve or other tissue electrical signals associated with the intended contraction of the muscle to an interpreter of the information.

<claims>
1. An apparatus comprising a wrist worn user interface device having a sensor configured to detect, at a top surface of a wrist of a human, nerve or other tissue electrical signals associated with intended contractions and extensions of a muscle to cause a gesture comprising repeated flicks of only an index finger of the hand attached to the wrist, each of the repeated flicks of the gesture having a duration less than one-half second and comprising a contraction and an extension of only the index finger, an output configured to provide information representative of the nerve or other tissue electrical signals associated with the intended contractions and extensions of the muscle, and an interpreter configured to receive and interpret the information representative of the nerve or other tissue electrical signals and provide an indication of the intended contractions and extensions of the muscle to cause the gesture comprising repeated flicks of only the index finger, the indication being provided to a responsive device not located on the hand attached to the wrist to cause the responsive device to treat the indication as a gesture invoking a user interface control of a display.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 comprising a responsive device coupled to the interpreter and configured to respond to the intended contractions and extensions of the muscle by an action.
3. The apparatus of claim 2 in which the responsive device is configured to respond by an action that includes changing an audio or visual presentation to the human.
4. The apparatus of claim 3 in which the responsive device is configured to respond by an action that includes changing the audio or visual presentation as if the intended contraction of the muscle corresponded to an invocation of a user interface control.
5. 5-18. (canceled)
19. An apparatus comprising a wrist-worn user interface device having a sensor configured to detect, at a top surface of a wrist of a human hand, nerve or other tissue electrical signals associated (a) with an activation of a muscle intended to cause a first motion of the hand, and (b) with an activation of a muscle intended to cause, at a time during or at the end of the first motion, a stationary hold of the hand, an output configured to provide to an interpreter information representative of the nerve or other tissue electrical signals associated with the activations intended to cause the first motion and the stationary hold, and an interpreter configured to receive and interpret the information representative of the nerve or other tissue electrical signals and to provide (a) a first indication of the activation intended to cause the first motion, and (b) a second indication of the activation of the motion intended to cause the stationary hold, the first indication configured to cause an action to be performed on a display of a responsive device not mounted on the hand, the second indication being configured to cause the responsive device to continue the performance of the action to be performed on the display of the responsive device during at least a part of the stationary hold.
20. (canceled)
21. The apparatus of claim 19 in which the action includes changing an audio or visual presentation to the human.
22. The apparatus of claim 19 in which the motion of the hand comprises a motion of a finger of the hand.
23. (canceled)
24. The apparatus of claim 21 in which the action includes continuing the change of the audio or visual presentation.
25. The apparatus of claim 19 in which the first motion comprises a rotation of the hand, and the second motion comprises the hand being held stationary during or at the end of the rotation.
26. The apparatus of claim 19 in which the first motion comprises an index finger lift, and the second motion comprises the finger being held stationary during or at the end of the rotation.
27. 27-30. (canceled)
31. The apparatus of claim 19 in which the action to be performed on the display of the responsive device comprises motion of a displayed graphical element in response to the first motion of the hand and to the stationary hold.
32. The apparatus of claim 19 in which the first motion of the hand comprises rotation of a palm relative to an elbow.
33. The apparatus of claim 32 in which the action to be performed comprises rotating a displayed graphical element in response to the rotation of the palm relative to the elbow.
34. The apparatus of claim 31 in which the displayed graphical element comprises a three-dimensional representation of an object and the action to be performed comprises rotating the displayed graphical element in three-dimensional space
35. The apparatus of claim 31 in which the displayed graphical element comprises a digital camera control and the action to be performed comprises adjusting the digital camera control.
36. The apparatus of claim 31 in which the displayed graphical element comprises characters of an access code and the action to be performed comprises rotating the displayed graphical element to select characters of the access code.
