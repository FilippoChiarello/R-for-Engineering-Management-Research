SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING AND INTERACTING WITH COORDINATED PRESENTATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method provide customizable interactive audio/video content to each of a plurality of computing devices. When executing at least some code stored in the memory, a processor generates a coordinated presentation by integrating in the memory, via a video mixer, one or more images from a camera with content selected by at least one user. Further the at least one processor is configured to process the coordinated presentation to provide an abridged version of the coordinated presentation at at least one of the remote devices.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system for providing respectively customizable interactive audio/video content to each of a plurality of computing devices, the system comprising: at least one processor; a memory that is accessible by the at least one processor; a camera that is accessible by the at least one processor and that is configured to capture one or more images; a display that is accessible by the at least one processor and that is configured to display content; a touch-screen interface accessible by the at least one processor and that is configured to receive input from a user; and a video mixer module stored in the memory that is configured to mix graphical content; wherein, when executing at least some code stored in the memory, the at least one processor is configured to: generate a coordinated presentation by integrating in the memory, via the video mixer, one or more images from the camera with content selected by at least one user, wherein the coordinated presentation is configured to enable respective interaction at each of a plurality of remote devices, such that results of a respective interaction at a particular remote device are viewable at the particular remote device but are not viewable at other of the remote devices, wherein the coordinated presentation is further configured to be transmitted to the one or more remote devices; process the coordinated presentation to provide an abridged version of the coordinated presentation at at least one of the remote devices.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the abridged version is provided in a graphical user interface configured with a timeline.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the coordinated presentation is processed by the at least one processor by: determining a plurality of events in the coordinated presentation; indexing each of the plurality of events; and providing, in a timeline configured in a graphical user interface, the abridged version of the coordinated presentation as a function of the indexed events.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the at least one processor is configured to assign a weight to at least one of the indexed events.
5. The system of claim 3, wherein at least one processor is configured to adjust the length of the abridged version of the coordinated presentation as a function of the indexed events.
6. The system of claim 3, wherein the events are detected by the at least one processor as a function of changes in content in the coordinated presentation.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the changes represent changes in the content selected by the at least one user.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the changes in the content include at least one of: display of a presentation slide; display of a person; user interaction of content in the coordinated presentation; user behavior within the coordinated presentation; biometrics of at least one user within the coordinated presentation; and a discussion of users in the coordinated presentation.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the coordinated presentation includes an videoconference session between a plurality of user computing devices.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is configured to provide a dashboard interface for users to define respective portions of the coordinated presentation that are to be provided or skipped in the abridged version of the coordinated presentation.
11. A method for providing respectively customizable interactive audio/video content to each of a plurality of computing devices, the method comprising: accessing, by at least one processor, a memory that stores code for configuring the at least one processor; generating, by the at least one processor, a coordinated presentation by integrating in the memory, via a video mixer, one or more images from a camera with content selected by at least one user, wherein the coordinated presentation is configured to enable respective interaction at each of a plurality of remote devices, such that results of a respective interaction at a particular remote device are viewable at the particular remote device but are not viewable at other of the remote devices, wherein the coordinated presentation is further configured to be transmitted to the one or more remote devices; processing, by the at least one processor, the coordinated presentation to provide an abridged version of the coordinated presentation at at least one of the remote devices.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the abridged version is provided in a graphical user interface configured with a timeline.
13. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining, by the at least one processor, a plurality of events in the coordinated presentation; indexing, by the at least one processor, each of the plurality of events; and providing, by the at least one processor, in a timeline configured in a graphical user interface, the abridged version of the coordinated presentation as a function of the indexed events.
14. The method of claim 13, further comprising assigning, by the at least one processor, a weight to at least one of the indexed events.
15. The method of claim 13, further comprising adjusting, by the at least one processor, the length of the abridged version of the coordinated presentation as a function of the indexed events.
16. The method of claim 13, detecting, by the at least one processor, the events as a function of changes in content in the coordinated presentation.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the changes represent changes in the content selected by the at least one user.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the changes in the content include at least one of: display of a presentation slide; display of a person; user interaction of content in the coordinated presentation; user behavior within the coordinated presentation; biometrics of at least one user within the coordinated presentation; and a discussion of users in the coordinated presentation.
19. The method of claim 11, wherein the coordinated presentation includes an videoconference session between a plurality of user computing devices.
20. The method of claim 11, further comprising providing, by the at least one processor, a dashboard interface for users to define respective portions of the coordinated presentation that are to be provided or skipped in the abridged version of the coordinated presentation.
