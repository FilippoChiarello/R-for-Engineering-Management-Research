DATA BREACH PREVENTION AND REMEDIATION
</title>

<abstract>
Data validation systems and methods are provided. The method comprises generating a data set associated with a first credential information; submitting the data set to a data provider over a computing network to validate the first credential information, the data provider analyzing the data set to determine whether a match is found for the first credential information based on second credential information known to have been compromised; and in response to a match being found, determining that the first credential information has been potentially compromised.

<claims>
1. A data validation method comprising: generating a data set associated with a first credential information; submitting the data set to a data provider over a computing network to validate the first credential information, the data provider analyzing the data set to determine whether a match is found for the first credential information based on second credential information known to have been compromised; and in response to a match being found, determining that the first credential information has been potentially compromised.
2. The method of claim 1 further comprising requesting a user associated with the first credential information to update the first credential information, in response to confirming that the first credential information has been compromised.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the data set comprises a cryptographic hash of at least a part of the first credential information.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the data provider searches a series of hash values to find a match for the cryptographic hash.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the series of hash values comprise a hash of at least a part of the second credential information known to have been compromised.
6. The method of claim 1 further comprising storing information associated with the match found in a cache locally available to a customer credential system of an institution responsible for safeguarding the first credential information.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein a splitter is utilized to provide the information associated with the match found to one or more of the cache or the customer credential system of the institution responsible for safeguarding the first credential information.
8. The method of claim 2, wherein the match is found by comparing a partial hash of the first credential information with a partial hash of the second credential information known to have been compromised.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein in response to the match being found, a full hash value of the second credential information known to have been compromised is received.
10. The method of claim 9 further comprising: comparing the full hash value of the second credential information with the full hash value of the first credential information to confirm the first credential information has been compromised.
11. A system comprising: at least one programmable processor; and a non-transitory machine-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by the at least one programmable processor, cause the at least one programmable processor to perform operations comprising: generating a data set associated with a first credential information; submitting the data set to a data provider over a computing network to validate the first credential information, the data provider analyzing the data set to determine whether a match is found for the first credential information based on second credential information known to have been compromised; and in response to a match being found, determining that the first credential information has been potentially compromised.
12. The system of claim 11 further comprising requesting a user associated with the first credential information to update the first credential information, in response to confirming that the first credential information has been compromised.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the data set comprises a cryptographic hash of at least a part of the first credential information.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the data provider searches a series of hash values to find a match for the cryptographic hash.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the series of hash values comprise a hash of at least a part of the second credential information known to have been compromised.
16. The system of claim 11 further comprising storing information associated with the match found in a cache locally available to a customer credential system of an institution responsible for safeguarding the first credential information.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein a splitter is utilized to provide the information associated with the match found to one or more of the cache or the customer credential system of the institution responsible for safeguarding the first credential information.
18. A computer program product comprising a non-transitory machine-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by at least one programmable processor, cause the at least one programmable processor to perform operations comprising: generating a data set associated with a first credential information; submitting the data set to a data provider over a computing network to validate the first credential information, the data provider analyzing the data set to determine whether a match is found for the first credential information based on second credential information known to have been compromised; and in response to a match being found, determining that the first credential information has been potentially compromised.
19. The computer program product of claim 18, wherein the match is found by comparing a partial hash of the first credential information with a partial hash of the second credential information known to have been compromised.
20. The computer program product of claim 19, further comprising: in response to the match being found, receiving a full hash value of the second credential information known to have been compromised; and comparing the full hash value of the second credential information with the full hash value of the first credential information to confirm the first credential information has been compromised.
