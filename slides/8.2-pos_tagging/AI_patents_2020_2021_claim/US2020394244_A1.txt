System And Method For Matching A User To Another Entity
</title>

<abstract>
In an example, a system is disclosed. The system includes at least one processor and a computer-readable medium configured to store instructions for execution by the at least one processor. The instructions include: receiving login credentials from a client device corresponding to a user profile; presenting an entity profile at a display of the client device, wherein the entity profile is within a scoring category of the user profile; presenting a scoring graphical interface at the display corresponding to the entity profile, wherein the scoring graphical interface includes a scoring dial; and updating a score of the entity profile in response to receiving the score from the client device.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system comprising: at least one processor; and a computer-readable medium configured to store instructions for execution by the at least one processor, wherein the instructions include: receiving login credentials from a client device corresponding to a user profile; presenting an entity profile at a display of the client device, wherein the entity profile is within a scoring category of the user profile; presenting a scoring graphical interface at the display corresponding to the entity profile, wherein the scoring graphical interface includes a scoring dial; and updating a score of the entity profile in response to receiving the score from the client device.
2. The system as recited in claim 1, wherein the instructions include: updating the scoring category of the entity profile based on the updated score, wherein the scoring category is associated with a hue.
3. The system as recited in claim 1, wherein the instructions include: receiving a request to generate a user-generated query corresponding to the entity profile; generating the user-generated query; and sending the user-generated query to the entity profile.
4. The system as recited in claim 1, wherein the instructions include: receiving a request to select a gift corresponding to the entity profile; initiating payment authentication for the gift; and sending the payment authentication to an electronic commerce server corresponding to the gift.
5. The system as recited in claim 1, wherein the instructions include: receiving a first image from the client device; receiving a second image from the client device; determining whether a user is included in the first image and the second image; and generating an alert indicating the user is not in the first image or the second image.
6. The system as recited in claim 5, wherein a machine learning network determines whether the user is included in the first image and the second image.
7. The system as recited in claim 6, wherein the machine learning network includes at least one of a supervised learning network, an unsupervised learning network, a semi-supervised learning network, a reinforcement learning network, and a convolutional neural network.
8. The system as recited in claim 1, wherein the instructions include: receiving a request to send a communication to the entity profile from the client device; and sending the communication to the entity profile.
9. The system as recited in claim 1, wherein the scoring dial comprises a plurality of ticks corresponding to discrete scoring levels ranging between a lower scoring threshold and an upper scoring threshold.
10. The system as recited in claim 1, wherein the scoring graphical interface includes a booster scoring interface representing a score that is greater than an upper scoring threshold of the scoring dial.
11. A method comprising: receiving login credentials from a client device corresponding to a user profile; presenting an entity profile at a display of the client device, wherein the entity profile is within a scoring category of the user profile; presenting a scoring graphical interface at the display corresponding to the entity profile, wherein the scoring graphical interface includes a scoring dial; and updating a score of the entity profile in response to receiving the score from the client device.
12. The method as recited in claim 11, further comprising: updating the scoring category of the entity profile based on the updated score, wherein the scoring category is associated with a hue.
13. The method as recited in claim 11, further comprising: receiving a request to generate a user-generated query corresponding to the entity profile; generating the user-generated query; and sending the user-generated query to the entity profile.
14. The method as recited in claim 11, further comprising: receiving a request to select a gift corresponding to the entity profile; initiating payment authentication for the gift; and sending the payment authentication to an electronic commerce server corresponding to the gift.
15. The method as recited in claim 11, further comprising: receiving a first image from the client device; receiving a second image from the client device; determining whether a user is included in the first image and the second image; and generating an alert indicating the user is not in the first image or the second image.
16. The method as recited in claim 15, further comprising: learning, via a machine learning network, whether the user is included in the first image and the second image.
17. The method as recited in claim 16, wherein the machine learning network includes at least one of a supervised learning network, an unsupervised learning network, a semi-supervised learning network, a reinforcement learning network, or a convolutional neural network.
18. The method as recited in claim 11, further comprising: receiving a request to send a communication to the entity profile from the client device; and sending the communication to the entity profile.
19. The method as recited in claim 11, wherein the scoring dial comprises a plurality of ticks corresponding to discrete scoring levels ranging between a lower scoring threshold and an upper scoring threshold.
20. The method as recited in claim 11, wherein the scoring graphical interface includes a booster scoring interface representing a score that is greater than an upper scoring threshold of the scoring dial.
