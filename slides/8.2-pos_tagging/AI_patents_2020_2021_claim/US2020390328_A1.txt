<abstract>
Systems, devices, methods, and kits for monitoring one or more physiologic and/or physical signals from a subject are disclosed. A system including a head mounted display to monitor one or more physiologic signals from the face or head of the subject is disclosed. A method for analyzing an ocular parameter of the subject to determine a sympathetic and a parasympathetic outflow thereto is disclosed.

<claims>
1. A system for monitoring one or more physiologic signals, autonomic neural signals, and/or electrophysiological signals from a subject, comprising: a head mounted display sized for placement onto a head of the subject comprising a visual input device and a back-facing imaging sensor; the visual input device arranged within a field of view of the subject when the head mounted display is coupled thereto, the visual input device configured to display an output image for the subject; the back-facing imaging sensor arranged with a field of view covering one or more facial features of the subject when the head mounted display is coupled thereto, the back-facing imaging sensor configured to generate one or more feedback images the subject; and a processor electrically coupled and/or wirelessly coupled to the visual input device and the back-facing imaging sensor, the processor configured to deliver the output images, accept the feedback images, and analyze the images to determine one or more of the physiologic, autonomic neural, and/or electrophysiological signals.
2. The system in accordance with claim 1, wherein the head mounted display comprises a shroud, the shroud arranged so as to isolate one or more eyes of the subject from a surrounding environment, when the head mounted display is coupled to the head of the subject.
3. The system in accordance with claim 2, wherein the shroud comprises one or more sensors and/or electrodes, the sensors and/or electrodes arranged along the shroud so as to bias against one or more skin sites of the subject when the head mounted display is coupled to the head of the subject, the processor coupled to the sensors and/or electrodes.
4. The system in accordance with claim 3, wherein the electrodes are arranged along the shroud so as to capture, in conjunction with the processor, an electroretinogram, an electrooculogram, an electroencephalogram, and/or an electromyogram from the subject.
5. The system in accordance with claim 1, wherein the visual input device is configured to alter a light field near to one or more of the facial features via an output image, the back-facing imaging sensor configured to capture one or more aspects of the light field in a feedback image.
6. The system in accordance with claim 5, wherein altered light field occurs over an optical spectrum without substantially impacting a light reflex of the eye.
7. The system in accordance with claim 1, wherein one or more of the facial features is an iris, the back-facing imaging sensor configured to image the iris with a pixel count across the diameter of the iris of more than 50 pixels, more than 100 pixels, more than 200 pixels, or more than 400 pixels, the processor comprising an algorithm configured to track one or more features of the iris.
8. The system in accordance with claim 1, wherein the back-facing imaging sensor is configured to take more than 10 images per second, more than 20 images per second, more than 40 images per second, or more than 80 images per second.
9. The system in accordance with claim 8, wherein one or more of the features of the iris comprises one or more of a ciliary zone, a pupil, a sphincter muscle/pupillary zone, a crypt, a peripheral crypt, a contraction furrow, a mole, a region of alternative/distinct color, a color distorted region, a region of contrast, an identifiable region, a diameter, boundary, centroid, area, distortion, or combination thereof.
10. The system in accordance with claim 1, wherein the visual input device comprise a display, an LED, an visible light LED, a broadband light source, one or more narrow band light sources, an IR light source, a UV light source, an IR LED, a light source array, a curved display, an AMOLED display, a flexible AMOLED display, a transparent display, a smart glass display, an electrochromatic film, or a combination thereof.
11. The system in accordance with claim 1, wherein the visual input device comprises a semi-transparent display.
12. The system in accordance with claim 1, wherein the back-facing imaging sensor is a camera, a visible light camera, a near infrared camera, an infrared camera, short wavelength infrared camera, a CMOS imaging sensor, an infrared imaging sensor, a laser speckle imaging sensor, a coherence tomographic imaging element, or a combination thereof.
13. The system in accordance with claim 1, wherein the head mounted display comprises a plurality of visual feedback devices, and/or a plurality of back-facing imaging sensors.
14. The system in accordance with claim 1, wherein the head mounted display comprises one or more audio input devices, arranged so as to interface with the ears of the subject when the head mounted display is coupled to the head of the subject, the audio input devices coupled to the processor, the audio input devices configured to render an audio stream provided by the processor.
15. The system in accordance with claim 1, wherein the head mounted display comprises one or more optical sensors arranged so as to bias against one or more skin sites of the subject when the head mounted display is coupled to the head of the subject, the processor coupled to the optical sensors to receive one or more hemodynamic and/or tissue analyte signals.
16. The system in accordance with claim 15, wherein one or more of the optical sensors is integrated into the shroud, integrated into the audio input device, and/or arranged so as to interface with a nose, a nasal bridge, a temple region, an ocular region, an ear, an earlobe, and/or an ear canal of the subject.
17. The system in accordance with claim 1, further comprising one or more physiologic sensors coupled to the body of the subject to produce one or more physiologic signals therefrom, each of the physiologic sensors in wireless communication with the processor to provide the physiologic signals thereto.
18. The system in accordance with claim 17, wherein one or more of the physiologic sensors comprise an electrophysiologic sensor, a heart-rate sensor, a skin neural activity sensor, a temperature sensor, a thermal gradient sensor, a barometer, an altimeter, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a humidity sensor, a magnetometer, an inclinometer, an oximeter, a colorimetric monitor, a perfusion sensor, a sweat analyte sensor, a galvanic skin response sensor, an interfacial pressure sensor, a flow sensor, a stretch sensor, or a microphone.
