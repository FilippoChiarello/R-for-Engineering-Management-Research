DEFOCUS AMOUNT MEASURING DEVICE, DEFOCUS AMOUNT MEASURING METHOD, DEFOCUS AMOUNT MEASURING PROGRAM, AND DISCRIMINATOR
</title>

<abstract>
A marker image detection section detects a marker image from a captured image for determining a defocus amount. A discriminator discriminates the defocus amount of the marker image included in the captured image. The discriminator performs learning using feature amounts related to a plurality of teacher marker images captured with various defocus amounts and discriminates a defocus amount of an input marker image.

<claims>
1. A defocus amount measuring device comprising at least one processor, wherein the processor is configured to: detect a marker image from a captured image acquired by imaging a marker that is a measurement target of a defocus amount; and discriminate a defocus amount of an input marker image by a discriminator that performs learning using feature amounts related to a plurality of teacher marker images captured with various defocus amounts.
2. The defocus amount measuring device according to claim 1, wherein the discriminator discriminates the defocus amount for each of a plurality of the marker images included in the captured image, and the processor is further configured to determine a statistical value of a plurality of the defocus amounts as the defocus amount of the captured image.
3. The defocus amount measuring device according to claim 1, wherein the discriminator discriminates that the defocus amount is not clear.
4. The defocus amount measuring device according to claim 1, wherein the discriminator is configured by a neural network.
5. The defocus amount measuring device according to claim 1, wherein the discriminator learns a co-occurrence matrix related to the plurality of teacher marker images as the feature amount.
6. The defocus amount measuring device according to claim 1, wherein the marker has a fine cell structure.
7. The defocus amount measuring device according to claim 1, wherein the captured image includes the marker and is acquired by imaging a container in which an observation target is contained, by an imaging unit, and wherein the processor is further configured to perform a control for focusing an image of the observation target in the container on the imaging unit on the basis of the defocus amount.
8. The defocus amount measuring device according to claim 7, further comprising: a stage on which the container in which the observation target is contained is placed, wherein the captured image is acquired by scanning an observation region in the container placed on the stage and performing imaging of each observation region in the container, and wherein the processor is configured to perform the control for focusing the image of the observation target in the container on the imaging unit on the basis of the defocus amount, in each observation region.
9. A defocus amount measuring method comprising: detecting a marker image from a captured image acquired by imaging a marker that is a measurement target of a defocus amount; and discriminating, using a discriminator that performs learning using feature amounts related to a plurality of teacher marker images captured with various defocus amounts and that discriminates a defocus amount of an input marker image, the defocus amount of the input marker image.
10. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium that stores a defocus amount measuring program causing a computer to execute: a process of detecting a marker image from a captured image acquired by imaging a marker that is a measurement target of a defocus amount; and a process of discriminating, using a discriminator that performs learning using feature amounts related to a plurality of teacher marker images captured with various defocus amounts and that discriminates a defocus amount of an input marker image, the defocus amount of the input marker image.
11. A discriminator that performs learning using feature amounts related to a plurality of teacher marker images captured with various defocus amounts and discriminates a defocus amount of an input marker image.
12. A defocus amount measuring device comprising: a discriminator that performs learning using feature amounts related to a plurality of teacher marker images captured with various defocus amounts and in a case where a captured image acquired by imaging a marker that is a measurement target of a defocus amount is input, discriminates a presence or absence of a marker image in the captured image and a defocus amount of the marker image in a case where the marker image is included in the captured image.
13. A discriminator that performs learning using feature amounts related to a plurality of teacher marker images captured with various defocus amounts and in a case where a captured image acquired by imaging a marker that is a measurement target of a defocus amount is input, discriminates a presence or absence of a marker image in the captured image and a defocus amount of the marker image in a case where the marker image is included in the captured image.
