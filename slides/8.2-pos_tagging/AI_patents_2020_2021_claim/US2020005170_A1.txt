DIGITAL MDR (MANAGED DETECTION AND RESPONSE) ANALYSIS
</title>

<abstract>
A method for detecting an occurrence of an online event including retrieving a data item from online sources; forming a list by tagging words and/or strings within the data item according to predefined attributes such that the list includes the words and/or strings with their corresponding attributes; forming sequence items relating to the list according to a predefined criterion such that each sequence item includes at least the list and optionally additional preformed lists that have been formed in the same manner as the list and that have a shared concept with the list according to the predefined criterion; running each of the sequence items in a preformed machine learning classifying model that outputs a determination if there is an occurrence of the online event or not. The present invention further relates to generating the machine learning classifying model. The present invention also relates to a corresponding system.

26. A method for detecting an occurrence of an online event comprising: retrieving a data item from online sources; forming a list by tagging words and/or strings within the data item according to predefined attributes such that said list comprises the words and/or strings with their corresponding attributes; forming sequence items relating to the list according to a predefined criterion such that each sequence item comprises at least said list and optionally additional preformed lists that have been formed in the same manner as said list and that have a shared concept with said list according to the predefined criterion; and running each of said sequence items in a preformed machine learning classifying model that outputs a determination if there is an occurrence of the online event or not.
27. The method according to claim 26, wherein the data item is a webpage content.
28. The method according to claim 26, wherein the online event relates to a cyber-threat or to a certain subject of interest.
29. The method according to claim 26, further comprising alerting a certain person when the determination of the occurrence of the event is deemed positive.
30. The method according to claim 26, further comprising performing an actionable step when the determination of the occurrence of the event is deemed positive.
31. The method according to claim 30, wherein the actionable step is mitigating a cyber-threat.
32. The method according to claim 26, wherein the list comprises a metadata attribute relating to the time or source of the retrieval of the data item.
33. The method according to claim 26, further comprising running each sequence item in one or more preformed machine learning classifying models that output a determination if there is an occurrence of the online event or not, and applying an averaging function on the outputs of the machine learning classifying models that outputs a final determination if there is an occurrence of the online event or not.
