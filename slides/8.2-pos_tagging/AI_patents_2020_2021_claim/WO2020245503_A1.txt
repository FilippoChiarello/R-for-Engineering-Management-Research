<title>
CONCRETE QUALITY ASSURANCE
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided concrete quality assurance. An artificial intelligence engine (102) is initially trained based on measurement data from a plurality of concrete production processes (106, 116). The artificial intelligence engine (102) is localized by training the artificial intelligence engine (102) based on validation data for directly indicating concrete characteristics of the concrete batches produced at at least one specific concrete production process. Quality assurance events of the concrete batches produced by the at least one specific concrete production process (106, 116) are determined based on measurement data from sensors (108, 110, 112, 118, 120,10 122) and concrete production process data from the at least one specific concrete production process.
