BIOMARKERS AND METHODS FOR PERSONALIZED TREATMENT OF SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER USING KDM1A INHIBITORS
</title>

<abstract>
The present application discloses biomarkers and methods to predict responsiveness of a patient having small cell lung cancer (SCLC) to treatment with KDM1A inhibitors, and methods of treating subgroups of SCLC patients identified using said methods.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of identifying a patient having SCLC who is more likely to respond to a treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor, the method comprising measuring the level of ASCL1 and SOX2 in a sample from the patient prior to initiating the treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor.
2. The method of claim 1 , further comprising identifying the patient as more likely to respond to a treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor when the level of each of ASCL1 and SOX2 in the sample surpasses a threshold.
3. The method of claim 1 , further comprising using the level of ASCL1 and SOX2 in the sample to generate a score for the sample, wherein the patient is identified as more likely to respond to a treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor when the score in the sample surpasses a threshold.
4. A method of identifying a patient having SCLC who may benefit from a treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor, the method comprising measuring the level of ASCL1 and SOX2 in a sample from the patient prior to initiating the treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising identifying the patient as one who may benefit from a treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor when the level of each of ASCL1 and SOX2 in the sample surpasses a threshold.
6. The method of claim 4, further comprising using the level of ASCL1 and SOX2 in the sample to generate a score for the sample, wherein the patient is identified as one who may benefit from a treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor when the score in the sample surpasses a threshold.
7. A method of selecting a treatment for a patient having SCLC, the method comprising measuring the level of ASCL1 and SOX2 in a sample from the patient prior to initiating the treatment.
8. The method of any of claims 1 to 7, wherein the ASCL1 level and the SOX2 level is an mRNA expression level.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the mRNA expression level is measured by qRT-PCR.
10. The method of any of claims 1 to 7, wherein the ASCL1 level and the SOX2 level is a protein expression level. 11. The method of claim 10, wherein the protein expression level is measured by fluorescence immunohistochemistry.
12. The method of any of claims 1 to 11 , wherein the sample is a biopsy.
13. The method of any one of claims 1 to 12, the method further comprising recommending, prescribing or administering a therapeutically effective amount of a treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor to the patient if the patient is identified as more likely to respond to a treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor.
14. KDM1A inhibitor for use in treating a patient having SCLC, wherein the patient has been identified as more likely to respond to a treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor using a method according to any of claims 1 to 12 prior to initiating the treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor.
15. A method of treating a patient having SCLC, the method comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor, if the patient has been identified as more likely to respond to a treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor using a method according to any of claims 1 to 12 prior to initiating the treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor.
16. Use of ASCL1 and SOX2 in a method of identifying a patient having SCLC who is more likely to respond to a treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor.
17. The method of claims 1 to 13, the KDM1A inhibitor for use of claim 14, the method of treatment of claim 15 or the use of claim 16, wherein the KDM1A inhibitor is (trans)-N1-((1 R,2S)-2-phenylcyclopropyl)cyclohexane-1 ,4- diamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
18. The method of claims 1 to 13 or 17, the KD 1A inhibitor for use of claim 14 or 17, the method of treatment of claim 15 or 17 or the use of claim 16 or 17, wherein the patient is a human patient.
19. A kit for assessing the likelihood of response of a patient having SCLC to a treatment comprising a KDM1A inhibitor, the kit comprising one or more agents for measuring the level of ASCL1 and SOX2 in a sample, and optionally, instructions for use.
