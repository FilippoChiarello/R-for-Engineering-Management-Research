<title>
RAPID ANALYSIS OF IMAGES
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for the rapid analysis of images that are particularly useful in avionic contexts are provided. One specific method describes steps of computing algorithmic complexity and/or logical depth, so as to rapidly categorize objects, comprising images and/or points of interest determined in these images, according to discrete levels of structuring, organization or order. Complex image processing operations may then concern restricted subsections of the images. The complexity or logical depth computing operations may for example comprise steps of losslessly compressing the objects row by row and/or column by column, of determining statistical distributions of the compression rates of these objects, of determining one or more scores on the basis of the compression rates or of statistical moments and of locally or globally categorizing one or more received images. Developments describe system and software aspects.

2. The method according to claim 1, the step of determining the algorithmic complexity and/or the logical depth of the image and/or of a plurality of points of interest determined in the image comprising the steps of: determining the lossless compression rates, row by row or column by column, of the received image; determining the statistical distribution of the lossless compression rates by computing the 1st-order to 4th-order statistical moments; determining an overall index between 0 and 1, characterizing the overall random level of said one image, on the basis of the average compression rate.
3. The method according to claim 1, comprising the steps of categorizing or classifying the image into classes that are discretized according to one or more predefined alpha thresholds, for example: classifying the image as being structured if the average compression rate is greater than 4; classifying the image as being locally structured if the distribution of the compression rates is asymmetrical on the basis of the 3rd-order and 4th-order statistical moments, and classifying the image as being slightly structured or unknown in other cases.
4. The method according to claim 1, furthermore comprising a step of determining the existence of one or more points of interest in the images.
5. The method according to claim 4, furthermore comprising the steps of: losslessly compressing the horizontal, respectively vertical, coordinates of the points of interest; determining the horizontal, respectively vertical, compression rates of the points of interest; determining a position index associated with the image from the horizontal, respectively vertical, compression rates of the points of interest.
6. The method according to claim 5, comprising the step of classifying the points of interest discretely according to one or more predefined beta thresholds, for example as having a structured or random position, on the basis of the determined position index.
7. The method according to claim 4, furthermore comprising the steps of: determining the statistical distribution of the geometric positions of the points of interest by computing the 1st-order to 4th-order statistical moments of said distribution; determining a point index associated with the image from the statistical moments of the distribution of the geometric positions of the points of interest.
8. The method according to claim 7, comprising the step of classifying the points of interest discretely according to one or more predefined gamma thresholds, for example as being structured or as being random, on the basis of the point index.
9. The method according to claim 3, furthermore comprising a step of determining the geometry of one or more areas of interest, said areas of interest being determined on the basis of the determined indices comprising the overall index, the position index and the point index.
10. The method according to claim 4, comprising the step of computing the centre of gravity of the determined points of interest and computing the limits of a rectangle encompassing points around the centre of gravity beyond a predefined zeta threshold, said rectangle indicating an area of interest.
11. The method according to claim 1, furthermore comprising a step of displaying one or more of the elements comprising the image, the category of the image and/or of the points of interest, one or more points of interest, one or more areas of interest, on at least one physical and/or virtual screen.
12. The method according to claim 3, furthermore comprising the step of receiving or determining the current flight phase and, on the basis of said current flight phase, modifying one or more values of the alpha, beta, gamma and/or zeta thresholds.
13. The method, consisting in repeating one or more of the steps of claim 1 for one or more images received after the first image.
14. A computer program product, said computer program comprising code instructions for performing the steps of the method according to claim 1, when said program is executed on a computer.
