<title>
Automatic Animal Detection and Deterrent System
</title>

<abstract>
This disclosure provides a method of detecting and deterring a target animal from a target area. A target area is positioned within the field of vision of a video camera connected to a computer processing system. An animal identification computer program using convolution neural networks and deep learning computer programs and camera images rapidly detects a target animal. The animal identification computer program is trained to identify target animals accurately using a learning algorithm and related machine learning technology. The time to deploy a deterrent against a target animal from the instant of detection is 2 seconds or less so that little or no time is available to the target animal to damage the target area.

<claims>
1. A method of detecting and deterring a target animal from a target area, comprising: 1) placing the target area within the field of vision of a camera, wherein the camera is connected to a computer processing system; 2) running an animal identification computer program using convolution neural networks and deep learning computer programs with camera images from the camera to detect a target animal; 3) verifying if a target animal is in the field of view of the camera; 4) recording the target animal with the camera if the target animal is in the field of view of the camera; 5) arming one or more deterrents and setting a target location; and 6) deploying the deterrent to cause the target animal to leave the target area.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising stopping the recording after step 6 and saving the recording to a file in the computer.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising repeating steps 3 through 6 if the target animal has not left the target area after deploying the deterrent.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising continuing to perform step 3 until a target animal is in the field of view of the camera.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising training the animal identification computer program to identify target animals using a learning algorithm.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising training the learning algorithm with training data sets.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising validating the training of the learning algorithm with validation data sets.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising creating the training data sets and the validation data sets by gathering target animal image data in a target area, building image data sets for target animals and for target areas from the image data, and annotating or labeling images in the data sets so that the data sets may be entered into the learning algorithm.
9. A method of detecting and deterring a target animal from a target area, comprising: 1) placing the target area within the field of vision of a camera, wherein the camera is connected to a computer processing system; 2) running an animal identification computer program using convolution neural networks and deep learning computer programs with camera images from the camera to detect a target animal, wherein the animal identification computer program is trained to identify target animals using a learning algorithm; 3) verifying if a target animal is in the field of view of the camera; 4) recording the target animal with the camera if the target animal is in the field of view of the camera; 5) arming one or more deterrents and setting a target location; and 6) deploying the deterrent to cause the target animal to leave the target area.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising stopping the recording after step 6 and saving the recording to a file in the computer.
11. The method of claim 9, further comprising repeating steps 3 through 6 if the target animal has not left the target area after deploying the deterrent.
12. The method of claim 9, further comprising continuing to perform step 3 until a target animal is in the field of view of the camera.
13. The method of claim 9, further comprising training the learning algorithm with training data sets.
14. The method of claim 13, further comprising validating the training of the learning algorithm with validation data sets.
15. The method of claim 14, further comprising creating the training data sets and the validation data sets by gathering target animal image data in a target area, building image data sets for target animals and for target areas from the image data, and annotating or labeling images in the data sets so that the data sets may be entered into the learning algorithm.
16. A method of detecting and deterring a target animal from a target area, comprising: 1) placing the target area within the field of vision of a camera, wherein the camera is connected to a computer processing system; 2) running an animal identification computer program using convolution neural networks and deep learning computer programs with camera images from the camera to detect a target animal, wherein the animal identification computer program is trained to identify target animals using a learning algorithm; 3) verifying if a target animal is in the field of view of the camera; 4) recording the target animal with the camera if the target animal is in the field of view of the camera; 5) arming one or more deterrents and setting a target location; 6) deploying the deterrent to cause the target animal to leave the target area; 7) stopping the recording after step 6 and saving the recording to a file in the computer; 8) repeating steps 3 through 6 if the target animal has not left the target area after deploying the deterrent; and 9) continuing to perform step 3 until a target animal is in the field of view of the camera.
17. The method of claim 16, further comprising training the learning algorithm with training data sets.
18. The method of claim 17, further comprising validating the training of the learning algorithm with validation data sets.
19. The method of claim 18, further comprising creating the training data sets and the validation data sets by gathering target animal image data in a target area, building image data sets for target animals and for target areas from the image data, and annotating or labeling images in the data sets so that the data sets may be entered into the learning algorithm.
20. The method of claim 16, wherein the time from performing step 3 to performing step 6 is 0.25 to 2 seconds.
