METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR RECORDING A SUPER SLOW MOTION VIDEO IN A PORTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A method for processing image frames, and an electronic device are provided. The method includes receiving image frames captured by an image sensor at a first frame rate and storing the received image frames in a memory. A change is detected in the stored image frames and an image frame is interpolated between the stored image frames after detecting the change. The interpolated image is stored in the memory.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for processing image frames, the method comprising: receiving image frames captured by at least one image sensor at a first frame rate, storing the received image frames in a memory, detecting a change in the stored image frames, interpolating at least one image frame between the stored image frames after detecting the change, and storing the interpolated at least one image in the memory.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: encoding image frames stored in the memory at a second frame rate.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the second frame rate is lower than the first frame rate.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: discarding at least one image frame stored before detecting the change, from the memory.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: discarding at least one image frame stored after a predetermined period from detecting the change, from the memory.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the memory is a circular buffer and a size of the circular buffer is determined based on a delay for detecting the change.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the memory is a circular buffer and a size of the circular buffer is determined based on the first frame rate.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the change includes a change of a motion or a human emotion.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the change of the motion is detected using a motion detection library.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the interpolating the at least one image frame between the stored image frames is performed for a predetermined period.
11. An electronic device comprising: at least one image sensor; a memory; and at least one processor configured to: receive image frames captured by the at least one image sensor at a first frame rate, store the received image frames in the memory, analyze the received image frames, detect a change in the analyzed image frames, interpolate at least one image frame between the stored image frames after detecting the change, and store the interpolated at least one image in the memory.
12. The electronic device of claim 11, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to encode image frames stored in the memory at a second frame rate.
13. The electronic device of claim 12, wherein the second frame rate is lower than the first frame rate.
14. The electronic device of claim 11, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to discard at least one image frame stored before detecting the change, from the memory.
15. The electronic device of claim 11, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to discard at least one image frame stored after a predetermined period from detecting the change, from the memory.
16. The electronic device of claim 11, wherein the memory is a circular buffer and a size of the circular buffer is determined based on a delay for detecting the change.
17. The electronic device of claim 11, wherein the memory is a circular buffer and a size of the circular buffer is determined based on the first frame rate.
18. The electronic device of claim 11, wherein the change includes a change of a motion or a human emotion.
19. The electronic device of claim 18, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to detect the change of the motion using a motion detection library.
20. The electronic device of claim 11, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to interpolate the at least one image frame between the stored image frames for a predetermined period.
