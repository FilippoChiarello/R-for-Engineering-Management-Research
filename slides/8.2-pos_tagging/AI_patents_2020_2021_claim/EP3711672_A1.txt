METHOD AND DEVICE FOR PRODUCING A PANORAMIC TOMOGRAPHIC IMAGE OF AN OBJECT TO BE RECORDED
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a method for producing a panoramic tomographic image (1, 11, 60) of an object (2) to be recorded using a 2D panoramic X-ray device (3), in the course of which X-rays (4) produced by means of an X-ray source (5) irradiate the object (2) and are acquired by means of an X-ray detector (7), wherein, during a movement of the X-ray source (5) and the X-ray detector (7) around the object (2), a number of 2D X-ray projection images (30) are acquired from different acquisition directions (6). A first panoramic tomographic image (1) is calculated from the acquired 2D X-ray projection images (30) using a reconstruction method, wherein the acquired 2D X-ray projection images (30) are modified using a modification method, wherein, from the modified 2D X-ray projection images (40, 50) and using the reconstruction method, a second panoramic tomographic image (11) is calculated with a higher weighting of artifacts (20) relative to anatomical structures (17, 18, 19), wherein a third panoramic tomographic image (60) with significantly reduced artifacts is calculated.

<claims>
1. Method for producing a panoramic tomographic image (1, 11, 60) of an object (2) to be recorded using a 2D panoramic X-ray device (3), in the course of which X-rays (4) produced by means of an X-ray source (5) irradiate the object (2) and are acquired by means of an X-ray detector (7), wherein, during a movement of the X-ray source (5) and the X-ray detector (7) around the object (2), a number of 2D X-ray projection images (30) are acquired from different acquisition directions (6), characterized in that a first panoramic tomographic image (1) is calculated from the acquired 2D X-ray projection images (30) using a reconstruction method, wherein the acquired 2D X-ray projection images (30) are modified using a modification method, wherein, from the modified 2D X-ray projection images (40, 50) and using the reconstruction method, a second panoramic tomographic image (11) is calculated with a higher weighting of artifacts (20) relative to anatomical structures (17, 18, 19), wherein a third panoramic tomographic image (60) is calculated by combining the first panoramic tomographic image (1) and the second panoramic tomographic image (11) with defined weighting factors such that the artifacts (20) in the third panoramic tomographic image (60) are reduced in comparison to the first panoramic tomographic image.
2. Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the third panoramic tomographic image (60) is calculated by subtracting the image information of the second panoramic tomographic image (11) from the image information of the first panoramic tomographic image (1) with defined weighting factors.
3. Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the modification method is a low-pass filtering in the movement direction of the 2D X-ray projection images (30), a location-dependent low-pass filtering (40) of the 2D X-ray projection images (30), and/or a horizontal mirroring (50) of the 2D X-ray projection images (30).
4. Method according to any one of Claims 1-3, characterized in that the third panoramic tomographic image (60) is displayed by means of a display device (12) .
5. Method according to any one of Claims 1-4, characterized in that the weighting factors for the combination of the first panoramic tomographic image (1) with the second panoramic tomographic image (11) are managed by means of a virtual tool (61), so that the strength of the displayed artifacts (20) can be set manually using the virtual tool (61).
6. Method according to Claim 5, characterized in that the virtual tool is a slider (61).
7. Method according to any one of Claims 1-4, characterized in that, for the combination of the first panoramic tomographic image (1) with the second panoramic tomographic image (11), the locally varying weighting factors are automatically defined adaptively with the aid of a computer as a function of the first panoramic tomographic image (1) and/or the second panoramic tomographic image (11), wherein regions (21, 22, 23) with artifacts (20) in the second panoramic tomographic image (11) are weighted more strongly than the other regions (21, 22, 23), so that a stronger reduction of artifacts (20) takes place in these defined regions. (21, 22, 23).
8. Method according to Claim 7, characterized in that an adaptive analysis method for automatically defining the locally varying weighting factors based on the first panoramic tomographic image (1) and/or the second panoramic tomographic image (11) uses a neural network for machine learning.
9. Method according to any one of Claims 1-4, characterized in that, for the combination of the first panoramic tomographic image (1) with the second panoramic tomographic image (11), the locally varying weighting factors are automatically defined adaptively with the aid of a computer as a function of a previously known standard model, wherein regions (21, 22, 23) with artifacts (20) within the standard model are defined, wherein said regions (21, 22, 23) in the second panoramic tomographic image (11) are weighted more strongly than the other regions, so that a stronger reduction of artifacts (20) takes place only in these defined regions. (21, 22, 23).
10. Device comprising a computer (13), a 2D panoramic X-ray device (3) and additional means for carrying out the method according to any one of Claims 1-9.
11. Computer program, comprising commands which, when the computer program is executed by a computer (13), cause said computer to carry out the method according to any one of Claims 1-9.
12. Computer-readable storage medium, comprising commands which, when executed by a computer (13), cause said computer to carry out the method according to any one of Claims 1-9.
