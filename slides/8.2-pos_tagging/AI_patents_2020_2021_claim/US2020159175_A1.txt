<title>
DEVICE CONTROL SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A sensor unit outputs a real sensor signal corresponding to a measured physical quantity. A controller controls a control target device in an environmental domain on the basis of the real sensor signal. The controller (a) performs a simulation of a specific phenomenon in the environmental domain under a simulation condition, and virtually measures the specific physical quantity on the basis of a simulation result and thereby generates a virtual sensor signal; (b) changes the simulation condition on the basis of the real sensor signal and the virtual sensor signal; and (c) generates a control signal for the control target device on the basis of the simulation condition and/or the simulation result. The simulation, the generation of the virtual sensor signal, and the change of the simulation condition are iteratively performed until a sensor error between the real sensor signal and the virtual sensor signal is converged.
