METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL HUMAN RESOURCE ALLOCATION ADVISER
</title>

<abstract>
A multi-dimensional human resource allocation adviser integrates with one or more employee skill set data sources and processes and aggregates both initial/static and dynamic skill set data from those sources. Machine learning algorithms are then used to normalize and rank the aggregated employee skills with respect to the skill set and requirements associated with a given task, project, or case. The set of employees determined to have employee skill sets that most closely match the skill set and other requirements associated with the given project, task, or case are then filtered based on rules and constraints determined by the requirements of the business and/or the client. The best employee match, or matches, remaining after the rules and constraints filtering are then recommended for assignment/allocation to the given task, project, or case.
