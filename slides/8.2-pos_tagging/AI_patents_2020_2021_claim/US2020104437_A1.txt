PHYSICS-BASED MODEL PARTICLE-FILTERING FRAMEWORK FOR PREDICTING RUL USING RESISTANCE MEASUREMENTS
</title>

<abstract>
One embodiment can provide a system for estimating a useful life of a load-bearing structure at least partly made of a conductive material. During operation, the system establishes a physics-based damage model for the load-bearing structure, performs a dynamic measurement to obtain at least one conductive property of the load-bearing structure as a function of fatigue cycles, estimates parameters of the physics-based damage model based on the measured conductive property, and estimates the useful life of the load-bearing structure based on the estimated parameters of the physics-based damage model.
