<title>
Multi-class decision system for categorizing industrial asset attack and fault types
</title>

<abstract>
According to some embodiments, a plurality of monitoring nodes may each generate a series of current monitoring node values over time that represent a current operation of the industrial asset. A node classifier computer, coupled to the plurality of monitoring nodes, may receive the series of current monitoring node values and generate a set of current feature vectors. The node classifier computer may also access at least one multi-class classifier model having at least one decision boundary. The at least one multi-class classifier model may be executed and the system may transmit a classification result based on the set of current feature vectors and the at least one decision boundary. The classification result may indicate, for example, whether a monitoring node status is normal, attacked, or faulty.
