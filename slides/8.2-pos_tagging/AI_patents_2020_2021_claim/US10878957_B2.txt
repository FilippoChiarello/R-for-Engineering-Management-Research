<title>
Need determination system
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a need determination system including a user interface for enabling a person to input a current combination of a current subject, at least one current informal caregiver (ICG) giving care to the current subject, and at least one relationship between the current subject and the at least one current ICG. A combination similarity measure is applied to the current combination and stored combinations, in order to determine a stored combination which is similar to the current combination, where a need of the current subject and/or a need of the at least one current ICG are determined based on one or more needs assigned to a stored subject and/or stored ICGs of the determined similar stored combination. This allows for a reliable and fast determination of needs of a subject and/or an ICG with relatively low technical efforts.
