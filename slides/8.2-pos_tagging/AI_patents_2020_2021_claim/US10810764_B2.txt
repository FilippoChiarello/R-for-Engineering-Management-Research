<title>
Interleaved multisample render targets for lossless compression
</title>

<abstract>
One embodiment provides for a general-purpose graphics processor comprising a hardware graphics rendering pipeline configured to perform multisample anti-aliasing, the hardware graphics rendering pipeline including pixel processing logic to determine color data for multiple sample locations of each pixel in a set of pixels and to contiguously pack the color data for the multiple sample locations of each pixel for storage to a multisample render target.

<claims>
1. A general-purpose graphics processor comprising: a hardware graphics renderer to perform multisample anti-aliasing, the hardware graphics renderer including: a pixel processor to determine color data for multiple sample locations of a pixel in a set of pixels and contiguously pack color values within the color data into a memory configured to store multiple sample locations for the pixel; and a compressor to perform lossless compression on the color values within the color data.
2. The general-purpose graphics processor as in claim 1, additionally comprising a rasterizer to determine sample coverage for input geometry and cause the pixel processor to determine color data for the multiple sample locations of the pixel.
3. The general-purpose graphics processor as in claim 1, wherein the pixel processor is to store only unique color values for the multiple sample locations of the pixel.
4. The general-purpose graphics processor as in claim 1, wherein the compressor is to remove duplicate color values for the multiple sample locations of the pixel.
5. The general-purpose graphics processor as in claim 4, wherein the compressor is to perform lossless compression on the color values within the color data before the color data is stored to the memory.
6. The general-purpose graphics processor as in claim 5, wherein the pixel processor is to interleave packed color data for each pixel in the set of pixels and interleaved packed color data is to be stored to the memory.
7. The general-purpose graphics processor as in claim 6, wherein the compressor is to perform the lossless compression on the interleaved packed color data.
8. The general-purpose graphics processor as in claim 7, wherein the compressor is to write the interleaved packed color data to memory.
9. The general-purpose graphics processor as in claim 8, wherein the packed color data is written to a single memory plane.
10. The general-purpose graphics processor as in claim 1, wherein the set of pixels is a tile of pixels.
11. A method comprising: determining, within a hardware graphics rendering pipeline of a graphics processing unit, a set of color values associated with multiple sample locations of a pixel within a scene; generating a compressed subset of the set of color values including distinct color values for the pixel; interleaving the compressed subset of the set of color values for the pixel into a memory plane; applying lossless compression to the set of color values within the memory plane; and storing the memory plane to a memory configured to store multiple sample locations per pixel.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein generating the compressed subset of the set of color values includes removing duplicate color values associated with the multiple sample locations within the pixel.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein generating the compressed subset of the set of color values includes storing only unique color values associated with the multiple sample locations within the pixel.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein interleaving the compressed subset of the set of color values for the pixel into the memory plane includes contiguously writing unique color values for the set of color values for the pixel within a cache line of a render cache.
15. The method as in claim 14, wherein applying lossless compression to the set of color values within the memory plane includes compressing color data stored in the cache line of the render cache and writing compressed color data to an address associated with the memory plane.
16. A data processing system comprising: a memory device including memory configured to store multiple sample locations for each pixel in a set of pixels; and a general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) including a hardware graphics rendering pipeline configured to perform multisample anti-aliasing, wherein the hardware graphics rendering pipeline includes: a pixel processor to determine color data for multiple sample locations of a pixel in the set of pixels and to contiguously pack the color data for the multiple sample locations of the pixel for storage to the memory; and a compressor to perform lossless compression on the color data before the color data is stored to the memory.
17. The data processing system as in claim 16, wherein the pixel processor of the GPGPU is to interleave packed color data for the pixel and interleaved packed color data is to be stored to the memory.
