</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the subject disclosure may include, for example, a method comprising: obtaining media content, such as video; receiving a request from a user and/or user equipment (UE) to view the media content; identifying a predicted field of view of the user; sending the predicted field of view to the equipment of the user at a normal priority; monitoring a line of sight (or actual field of view) of the user; determining a field of view error as a difference between the line of sight and the predicted field of view; and sending the field of view error to the equipment of the user at a higher priority. Other embodiments are disclosed.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: obtaining, by a processing system having a processor, media content; receiving, by the processing system, a request from equipment of a user to view the media content; identifying, by the processing system, a predicted field of view of the user; sending, by the processing system, a base layer of the predicted field of view to the equipment of the user at a first priority; monitoring, by the processing system, a line of sight of the user; determining, by the processing system, an overlap of the line of sight and the predicted field of view; sending, by the processing system, an enhancement layer of the overlap to the equipment of the user at a second priority, wherein the second priority is lower than the first priority; determining, by the processing system, a field of view error as a difference between the line of sight and the predicted field of view; and sending, by the processing system, the field of view error to the equipment of the user at a third priority, wherein the third priority is higher than the first priority.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the predicted field of view is less than 180 degrees and wherein the sending the predicted field of view, further comprises sending more than 180 degrees centered on the predicted field of view.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the third priority dedicates a predetermined bandwidth to the field of view error to a detriment of network traffic at the first priority.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the media content includes virtual reality media content.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the equipment includes a virtual reality client device.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the sending the field of view error further comprises sending a base layer of the field of view error.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the sending the field of view error further comprises sending an enhancement layer of the field of view error.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising sending an enhancement layer of the field of view error at the first priority.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the sending the field of view error at the third priority causes a delay in network traffic at the first priority.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the sending the field of view error at the third priority further comprises sending the field of view error using bandwidth dedicated to potential field of view error.
11. A device, comprising: a processing system including a processor; and a memory that stores executable instructions that, when executed by the processing system, facilitate performance of operations, the operations comprising: obtaining media content responsive to receiving a request from equipment of a user to view the media content; identifying a predicted field of view of the user; sending a base layer of the predicted field of view to the equipment of the user at a first priority; monitoring a line of sight of the user; determining an overlap of the line of sight and the predicted field of view; sending an enhancement layer of the overlap to the equipment of the user at a second priority, wherein the second priority is lower than the first priority; determining a field of view error as a difference between the line of sight and the predicted field of view; and sending the field of view error to the equipment of the user at a third priority, wherein the third priority is higher than the first priority.
12. The device of claim 11, wherein the predicted field of view is less than 180 degrees and wherein the sending the base layer of the predicted field of view, further comprises sending more than 180 degrees centered on the predicted field of view.
13. The device of claim 11, wherein the third priority dedicates a predetermined bandwidth to the field of view error to a detriment of network traffic at the second priority.
14. The device of claim 11, wherein the sending the field of view error further comprises sending the base layer of the field of view error.
15. The device of claim 11, wherein the sending the field of view error further comprises sending the base layer and the enhancement layer of the field of view error.
16. A non-transitory machine-readable medium, comprising executable instructions that, when executed by a processing system including a processor, facilitate performance of operations, the operations comprising: obtaining media content responsive to receiving a request from equipment of a user to view the media content; determining a predicted field of view of the user with respect to the media content; sending a base layer of the predicted field of view to the equipment of the user at a first priority; determining, repeatedly, a line of sight of the user with respect to the media content; determining an overlap of the line of sight and the predicted field of view; sending an enhancement layer of the overlap to the equipment of the user at a second priority, wherein the second priority is lower than the first priority; determining a field of view error as a difference between the line of sight and the predicted field of view; and sending the field of view error to the equipment of the user at a third priority, wherein the third priority is higher than the first priority.
17. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 16, wherein the third priority dedicates a predetermined bandwidth to the field of view error to a detriment of network traffic at the first priority.
18. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 16, wherein the sending the field of view error at the third priority causes a delay in network traffic at the first priority.
19. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 16, wherein the sending the field of view error at the third priority further comprises sending the field of view error using bandwidth dedicated to potential field of view error.
20. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 16, wherein the equipment includes a virtual reality client device.
