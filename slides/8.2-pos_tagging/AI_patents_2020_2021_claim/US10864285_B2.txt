<title>
Methods for the diagnosis and treatment of Sjögren's syndrome
</title>

<abstract>
The finding that patients with Sjögren's syndrome exhibit a statistically significant increase in expression of BMP6 in the salivary gland relative to healthy control subjects is described. Also described is the finding that overexpression of BMP6 in the salivary glands of mice results in an increase in electrical potential across the salivary gland. Thus, methods of diagnosing a subject as having Sjögren's syndrome, or at risk for developing Sjögren's syndrome, by measuring the level of BMP6 expression in a salivary gland of a subject, measuring electrical potential in a salivary gland of a subject, or both, are disclosed. Also described are methods of treating a subject with Sjögren's syndrome by administering an agent that inhibits expression of BMP6 expression or activity. Further disclosed is the use of XIST and MECP2 as diagnostic and therapeutic targets for male Sjögren's syndrome patients.

<claims>
1. A method of diagnosing and treating Sjögren's syndrome in a subject, comprising: performing electrophysiologic tissue measurements of electrical potential or tissue impedance in a diagnostic circuit between a detection electrode in a salivary gland of the subject and a reference electrode in adjacent tissue; diagnosing the subject as having Sjögren's syndrome (i) detecting an increase in electrical potential or tissue impedance of the subject relative to a healthy control subject, and (ii) detecting the presence of autoantibodies to Ro (SSA) antigen in a serum sample obtained from the subject; and administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of an agent that promotes salivary production, a corticosteroid, an immunosuppressive drug, or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, thereby treating Sjögren's syndrome in the subject.
2. The method of claim 1, comprising selecting a subject with symptoms of dry eye or dry mouth prior to performing electrophysiologic tissue measurements.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the increase in electrical potential or tissue impedance is at least 10% relative to the healthy control subject.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the increase in electrical potential or tissue impedance is at least 30% relative to the healthy control subject.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the increase in electrical potential or tissue impedance is at least 50% relative to the healthy control subject.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the salivary gland is the submandibular gland or the parotid gland.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein electrical potential is measured using a device comprising a voltmeter, a detection electrode and a reference electrode, wherein the detection electrode comprises a cannula having a tip of a diameter suitable for insertion into the duct of a salivary gland, the reference electrode is suitable for attachment to tissue external and adjacent to the duct of the salivary gland, and the detection and reference electrodes establish a conductive pathway for an electrical current and determination of a voltage difference between the detection and reference electrodes.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the reference electrode is placed on oral mucosa less than 5 cm from the detection electrode.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the reference and detection electrodes are placed no more than 3 cm apart.
10. The method of claim 7, wherein the conductive pathway comprises in part a liquid pathway.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the conductive pathway further comprises a cannula suitable for insertion into the salivary gland and a liquid-filled syringe that provides a source of liquid for injection into the cannula, whereby the liquid at least partially establishes electrical current between the salivary gland and detection electrode.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising performing sequential electrophysiologic tissue measurements to assess changes in severity of Sjögren's syndrome or response to administering the agent that promotes salivary production, the corticosteroid, the immunosuppressive drug, or the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the method comprises administering the corticosteroid.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject is a human.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject is a mouse.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein the agent that promotes salivary production is pilocarpine or cevimeline.
17. The method of claim 13, wherein the corticosteroid is cortisol or prednisone.
