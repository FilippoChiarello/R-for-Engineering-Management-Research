Dynamic Hierarchical Delivery System
</title>

<abstract>
An electronic device in a system splits an order for multiple prepared beverage products into a subset of the order fulfilled by a mobile store in the system and a second subset of the order fulfilled by a second mobile store in the system, where the mobile store and the second mobile store fulfill orders by fabricating prepared beverage products in a set of prepared beverage products and delivering the prepared beverage products to destination locations. Next, the electronic device provides an instruction intended for the mobile store and a second instruction intended for the second mobile store, where the instruction specifies a destination location and the subset of the order to be fulfilled by the mobile store, and the second instruction specifies the second subset of the order to be fulfilled by the second mobile store and one of: the destination location or an exchange location.

1. A system, comprising: a fulfillment hub configured to store inventory for a set of prepared beverage products; a set of mobile stores configured to: receive portions of the inventory from the fulfillment hub; move to different locations in assigned geographic operating regions; and fulfill orders, wherein the fulfilling involves use of the set of mobile stores to fabricate prepared beverage products in the set of prepared beverage products using the portions of the inventory and to deliver the prepared beverage products to destination locations; and an electronic device configured to: receive information specifying an order, wherein the order is associated with a customer and comprises information specifying a destination location, a desired delivery time, and multiple prepared beverage products; split the order into a subset of the order fulfilled by a mobile store in the set of mobile stores and a second subset of the order fulfilled by a second mobile store in the set of mobile stores, wherein the splitting is based at least in part on one or more of: a location of the mobile store, a location of the second mobile store, an unused remainder of a portion of the inventory in the mobile store, an unused remainder of a second portion of the inventory in the second mobile store, a workload of the mobile store, or a workload of the second mobile store; and provide an instruction intended for the mobile store and a second instruction intended for the second mobile store, wherein the instruction specifies the destination location and the subset of the order to be fulfilled by the mobile store, and the second instruction specifies the second subset of the order to be fulfilled by the second mobile store and one of: the destination location or an exchange location where the second subset of the order is to be provided to the mobile store.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the set of prepared beverage products comprise coffees and teas.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the electronic device is configured to provide information, intended for the fabrication hub or the set of mobile stores, that specifies the portions of the inventory for the set of mobiles stores; and wherein the portions of the inventory are varied at different times of day based at least in part on previous orders received by the system.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the electronic device is configured to predict the order based at least in part on a previous order from the customer for an instance or a prepared beverage product, which was received by the system; and wherein, prior to the electronic device receiving the order, the electronic device provides information, intended for the fabrication hub or the mobile store, that specifies the portion of the inventory for the mobile store that comprises ingredients in the prepared beverage product based at least in part on the prediction.
5. The system of claim 3, wherein the instruction or the second instruction specifies exchange of material in the portion of the inventory or the second portion of the inventory between the mobile store and the second mobile store; and wherein the exchanged material is based at least in part on one or more of: an unused remainder of the portion of the inventory in the mobile store, an unused remainder of the second portion of the inventory in the second mobile store, the subset of the order, the second subset of the order, a location of the mobile store, a location of the second mobile store, an assigned geographic operating region of the mobile store, an assigned geographic operating region of the second mobile store, or a predicted future order based at least in part on the previous orders received by the system.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the electronic device is configured to provide information, intended for the set of mobile stores, that specifies the assigned geographic operating regions; and wherein the assigned geographic operating regions are varied at different times of day based at least in part on previous orders received by the system.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the portions of the inventory comprise pre-prepared portions of prepared beverage products in the set of prepared beverage products; wherein a pre-prepared portion of a prepared beverage product comprises a liquid corresponding to the prepared beverage product; and wherein the fulfilling involves use of the set of mobiles stores to fabricate remainders of the prepared beverage products using the pre-prepared portions of the prepared beverage products.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the prepared beverage product comprises a type of tea and the pre-prepared portion of the prepared beverage product is a pre-steeped liquid and has a tea-extract concentration that exceeds a tea-extract concentration of the prepared beverage product.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein the prepared beverage product comprises a type of coffee and the pre-prepared portion of the prepared beverage product is a pre-brewed liquid and has a coffee-extract concentration that exceeds a coffee-extract concentration of the prepared beverage product.
10. The system of claim 7, wherein the pre-prepared portion of the prepared beverage product comprises pre-cooked tapioca pearls.
11. The system of claim 7, wherein fabricating the remainders of the prepared beverage products comprises adding amounts of liquid to the pre-prepared portions of the prepared beverage products to obtain desired concentrations of the prepared beverage products.
12. The system of claim 7, wherein fabricating the remainders of the prepared beverage products comprises adding customized art work to containers that convey the prepared beverage products.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein given customized art work is selected based at least in part on information about a given customer associated with previous orders received by the system.
14. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium for use in conjunction with an electronic device in a system, the computer-readable storage medium storing program instructions that, when executed by the electronic device, causes the electronic device to perform one or more operations, comprising: receiving information specifying an order, wherein the order is associated with a customer and comprises information specifying a destination location, a desired delivery time, and multiple prepared beverage products; splitting the order into a subset of the order fulfilled by a mobile store in the system and a second subset of the order fulfilled by a second mobile store in the system, wherein fulfilling a given subset of the order involves use of a given mobile store to fabricate one or more prepared beverage products in a set of prepared beverage products using a given portion of inventory from a fabrication hub in the system and to deliver the one or more prepared beverage products to a given destination location, and wherein the splitting is based at least in part on one or more of: a location of the mobile store, a location of the second mobile store, an unused remainder of a portion of the inventory in the mobile store, an unused remainder of a second portion of the inventory in the second mobile store, a workload of the mobile store, or a workload of the second mobile store; and providing an instruction intended for the mobile store and a second instruction intended for the second mobile store, wherein the instruction specifies the destination location and the subset of the order to be fulfilled by the mobile store, and the second instruction specifies the second subset of the order to be fulfilled by the second mobile store and one of: the destination location or an exchange location where the second subset of the order is to be provided to the mobile store.
