METHOD FOR PROCESSING MULTI-DIRECTIONAL X-RAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IMAGE USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK AND APPARATUS THEREFOR
</title>

<abstract>
A method for processing a multi-directional X-ray computed tomography (CT) image using a neural network and an apparatus therefor are provided. The method includes receiving a predetermined number of multi-directional X-ray CT data and reconstructing an image for the multi-directional X-ray CT data using a neural network learned in each of an image domain and a sinogram domain.
