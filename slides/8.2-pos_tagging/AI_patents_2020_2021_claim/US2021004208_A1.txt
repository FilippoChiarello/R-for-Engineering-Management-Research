COUNTER BASED MULTIPLY-AND-ACCUMULATE CIRCUIT FOR NEURAL NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein includes a system, a method, and a device for improving computation efficiency of a neural network. In one aspect, adder circuitry is configured to add input data from processing of the neural network and a first number of bits of accumulated data for the neural network to generate summation data. In one aspect, according to a carry value of the adding from the adder circuitry, a multiplexer is configured to select between i) a second number of bits of the accumulated data and ii) incremented data comprising the second number of bits of the accumulated data incremented by a predetermined value. The summation data appended with the selected one of the second number of bits of the accumulated data or the incremented data may form appended data.
