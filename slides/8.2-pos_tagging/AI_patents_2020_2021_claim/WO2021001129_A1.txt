SUB-FIELD CONTROL OF A LITHOGRAPHIC PROCESS AND ASSOCIATED APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a method for determining an intra-field correction for control of a lithographic apparatus configured for exposing a pattern on an exposure field of a substrate, the method comprising: obtaining metrology data for use in determining the intra-field correction; determining an accuracy metric indicating a lower accuracy where the metrology data is not reliable and/or where the lithographic apparatus is limited in actuating a potential actuation input which is based on the metrology data; and determining said intra-field correction based at least partially on said accuracy metric.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for determining an intra-field correction for control of a lithographic apparatus configured for exposing a pattern on an exposure field of a substrate, the method comprising:
obtaining metrology data for use in determining the intra-field correction; determining an accuracy metric indicating a lower accuracy where the metrology data is not reliable and/or where the lithographic apparatus is limited in actuating a potential actuation input which is based on the metrology data; and
determining said intra-field correction based at least partially on said accuracy metric.
2. A method as described in claim 1, wherein the potential actuation input is configured for controlling a stage and/or projection lens manipulator of the lithographic apparatus.
3. A method as described in claim 1, wherein said intra-field correction is targeted to control a sub-field of the exposure field.
4. A method as described in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein said step of determining said intrafield correction comprises:
co-optimizing a first control profile for the lithographic apparatus and a second control profile for a reticle write process; and/or
optimizing time filtering constants and/or weighting constants used in a control loop for controlling the lithographic apparatus, wherein the control loop uses the metrology data.
5. A method as described in claim 1, further comprising using the accuracy metric to select a control strategy from a library of control strategies and wherein the intra-field correction is at least partially based on the selected control strategy.
6. A method as described in claim 5, wherein the control strategy comprises a measurement strategy for a metrology apparatus and or the lithographic apparatus.
7. A method as described in claim 6, wherein a density of measurement associated with the measurement strategy corresponding to the selected control strategy depends on the accuracy metric.
8. A method as described in claim 1, further comprising using the accuracy metric to select a control strategy using a trained solver, based on lithographic apparatus metrology data.
9. A method as described in claim 8, comprising: obtaining training data comprising nonlithographic apparatus metrology data and corresponding lithographic apparatus metrology data from a plurality of substrates; and training said solver to link said non-lithographic apparatus metrology data to said lithographic apparatus metrology data.
10. A method as described in claim 8 or 9, wherein said lithographic apparatus metrology data comprises leveling data.
11. A method as described in claim 10, further comprising determining an estimate for intra-die stress from the levelling data; and determining the intra-field correction based on the estimated intra die stress.
12. A method as described in claim 11, wherein said steps of determining an estimate and determining the intra-field correction are performed for each die.
13. A computer program comprising program instructions operable to perform the method of claim 1 when run on a suitable apparatus.
14. A non-transient computer program carrier comprising the computer program of claim 13.
15. A lithographic apparatus operable to perform the method of claim 1 and use said intra-field correction in a subsequent exposure.
