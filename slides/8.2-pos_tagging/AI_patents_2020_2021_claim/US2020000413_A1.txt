<title>
METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATED DIAGNOSTICS OF NONE-INFECTIOUS ILLNESSES
</title>

<abstract>
According to examples, an apparatus may include a processor and a memory on which is stored machine readable instructions executable by the processor to access test parameters of a patient; calculate average values for each of the accessed test parameters having a reference value range and assign binary coefficient values to the accessed test parameters based on comparison of the average value to the range limits; assign binary coefficient values to the accessed test parameters that do not have the reference value range based on a test parameter presence; generate a patient parameter matrix based on the assigned binary coefficient values; and apply statistical processing to the patient parameter matrix to make a diagnosis.

<claims>
1. An apparatus comprising: a processor; a memory on which are stored machine readable instructions that when executed by the processor, cause the processor to: access test parameters of a patient; calculate average values for each of the accessed test parameters having a reference value range and assign binary coefficient values to the accessed test parameters based on comparison of the average value calculated between a test parameter value and an upper and lower range values against the upper range value and the lower range value of the value range; assign binary coefficient values to the accessed test parameters that do not have the reference value range based on a test parameter presence; generate a patient parameter matrix based on the assigned binary coefficient values; and apply statistical processing to the patient parameter matrix to determine key diagnostic parameters indicating a presence of a none-infectious disease in the patient.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the instructions are further to cause the processor to determine the key diagnostic parameters by selecting a group from the accessed parameters, wherein the selected accessed test parameters have interdependencies within the group.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the instructions are further to cause the processor to apply statistical processing to the patient parameter matrix using cluster analysis to determine structural dependencies from all dependencies between the accessed test parameters.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the instructions are further to cause the processor to apply statistical processing to the patient parameter matrix using factor analysis to determine variations in factor weights and directions of each of the accessed test parameters under an impact from all of the accessed parameters.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the instructions are further to cause the processor to apply statistical processing to the patient parameter matrix using multiple regression to determine influence of independent accessed parameters over dependent accessed test parameters.
6. A method for an automated diagnosis comprising: accessing, by a processor of a diagnosis module, test parameters of a patient; calculating, by a processor of a diagnosis module, average values for each of the accessed test parameters having a reference value range; assigning, by a processor of a diagnosis module, binary coefficient values to the accessed test parameters based on comparison of the average value calculated between a test parameter value and an upper and lower range values against the upper range value and the lower range value of the value range; assigning, by a processor of a diagnosis module, binary coefficient values to the accessed test parameters that do not have the reference value range based on a test parameter presence; generating, by a processor of a diagnosis module, a patient parameter matrix based on the assigned binary coefficient values; and applying, by a processor of a diagnosis module, statistical processing to the patient parameter matrix to determine key diagnostic parameters indicating a presence of a none-infectious disease in the patient.
