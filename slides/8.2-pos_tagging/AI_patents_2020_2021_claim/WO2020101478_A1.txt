SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MANAGING DUPLICATE ENTITIES BASED ON A RELATIONSHIP CARDINALITY IN PRODUCTION KNOWLEDGE BASE REPOSITORY
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a system and method for managing one or more duplicate entities based on a relationship cardinality in a production knowledge base repository. The method comprises steps of performing a first level detection of duplicates in existing data present in the production knowledge base repository through an object harmonisation module (202). The first level detection identifies duplicates of one or more attribute objects within a specific entity. The object harmonisation module (202) implements a sanitization and standardization operation on the identified attribute objects. Then the method performs a second level detection of duplicates between entities of a specific concept through a homogeneity recognition module (204). The homogeneity recognition module (204) identifies duplicates according to base-attributes of the specific concept based on a predefined similarity threshold. The method then enables a user to determine the similarity of the entities and further enables the user to merge the similar entities through an entity conflation and merging module (206).

2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the object harmonisation module (202) further performs steps of:
extracting and grouping a plurality of entity triples per concept-attribute;
quantifying the attribute objects for the specific entity;
identifying a predefined classification of attribute object, wherein the classification comprises a resource description framework, RDF, a uniform resource identifier, URI, and a plurality of literals;
sanitizing and standardizing a format of a plurality of object values;
comparing the object values and identifying exact duplicate of the object values; harmonizing object data by deleting one or more duplicate triples of duplicate object URI/literals for an entity to ensure the uniqueness of the attribute objects; and
updating the production knowledge base repository.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein the sanitizing and standardizing format of object values comprises steps of:
removing of unnecessary characters from the object labels and literals; and
modifying into the standard format of object labels and object literals based on a predefined object literal rules.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein the homogeneity recognition module (204) comprises a concept base-attribute definition for analysis of a reference scope, wherein the homogeneity recognition module operably comprises the steps of:
identifying if the concept has more than one baseattribute;
executing homogeneity recognition based on a predefined similarity threshold;
repeating the execution of homogeneity recognition for each base-attribute having a first base-attribute as the primary base-attribute on identifying the concepts have more than one base-attribute;
computing a similarity ranking as per similar entity group; and
storing the identified list of similar entity group for usage of the entity conflation and merging module (206).
5. The method according to claim 4, wherein the similarity ranking is obtained by performing a plurality of steps comprises:
receiving a baseattribute count, X of the specific concept;
identifying the primary base-attribute for the specific concept;
computing the primary baseattribute value per entity by multiplying 0.65 to X;
computing the base-attribute value per entity by dividing 0.35 by the difference of X- 1 ; and multiplying the result by X, wherein the similarity ranking is based on the summation of primary base-attribute value and the base-attribute values per entity.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein the entity conflation and merging module (206) comprises a user interface for verification, wherein the entity conflation and merging module presents a list of similar entity groups in a concept sorted by the similarity ranking; displays a plurality of relationships with the corresponding objects for each entity; enables the user to verify data; nominates the primary entity and the secondary entity; validates property cardinality as defined in the relationship cardinality reference; merges duplicate entities to ensure the preservation of the semantic relationship, wherein the merging of duplicate entities comprise steps of replacing URI of secondary entities triple with the primary entity URI based in the property cardinality; appending the data in the primary entity not contained in the secondary entities to ensure the preservation of the semantic relationship of the primary entity; removing the redundant data triples; and updates the production knowledge base repository with cleansed data.
7. A system for managing one or more duplicate entities based on a relationship cardinality in a production knowledge base repository, the system comprises:
