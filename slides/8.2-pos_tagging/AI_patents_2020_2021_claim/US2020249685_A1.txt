PREDICTING THREE-DIMENSIONAL FEATURES FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING
</title>

<abstract>
A processor coupled to memory is configured to receive image data based on an image captured by a camera of a vehicle. The image data is used as a basis of an input to a trained machine learning model trained to predict a three-dimensional trajectory of a machine learning feature. The three-dimensional trajectory of the machine learning feature is provided for automatically controlling the vehicle.

<claims>
1. A system, comprising: a processor configured to: receive image data based on an image captured by a camera of a vehicle; use the image data as a basis of an input to a trained machine learning model trained to predict a three-dimensional trajectory of a machine learning feature; and provide the three-dimensional trajectory of the machine learning feature in automatically controlling the vehicle; and a memory coupled to the processor and configured to provide the processor with instructions.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the machine learning feature is associated with a vehicle lane line.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein portions of the three-dimensional trajectory of the vehicle lane line are occluded in the image data.
4. The system of claim 2, wherein the processor is further configured to use the vehicle lane line to identify a vehicle lane occupied by the vehicle.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the vehicle lane is used to identify a drivable space.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the identified drivable space is used to maintain the vehicle in the vehicle lane.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the camera of the vehicle includes at least of the following: a front-facing camera, a side-facing camera, or a rear-facing camera.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the predicted three-dimensional trajectory is one of a plurality of identified potential trajectories.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the predicted three-dimensional trajectory has a probability of occurring value that is the highest of the plurality of identified potential trajectories.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein a training data utilized to train the trained machine learning model includes a selected time series element in a group of time series elements.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the training data further includes a related set of odometry data associated with the group of time series elements.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein at least a portion of the training data is automatically labeled a corresponding ground truth.
13. The system of claim 1, wherein the controlling of the vehicle includes adjusting a speed and a steering of the vehicle.
14. The system of claim 1, wherein the three-dimensional trajectory is represented by a spline.
15. The system of claim 1, wherein the three-dimensional trajectory is represented by one or more piecewise polynomials.
16. The system of claim 1, wherein the machine learning feature is associated with a predicated path of a second vehicle.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein the predicated path of the second vehicle is used to determine whether the second vehicle is likely to enter a lane occupied by the vehicle being automatically controlled.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the controlling of the vehicle includes adjusting a speed or steering to avoid a collision with the second vehicle.
19. A computer program product, the computer program product being embodied in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium and comprising computer instructions for: receiving image data based on an image captured by a camera of a vehicle; using the image data as a basis of an input to a trained machine learning model trained to predict a three-dimensional trajectory of a vehicle lane; and providing the three-dimensional trajectory of the vehicle lane in automatically controlling the vehicle.
20. A method, comprising: receiving image data based on an image captured by a camera of a vehicle; using the image data as a basis of an input to a trained machine learning model trained to predict a three-dimensional trajectory of a vehicle lane; and providing the three-dimensional trajectory of the vehicle lane in automatically controlling the vehicle.
