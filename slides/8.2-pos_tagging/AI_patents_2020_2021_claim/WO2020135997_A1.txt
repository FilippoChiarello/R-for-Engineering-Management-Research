SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR INSPECTING A WAFER
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein is a computer-implemented defect prediction method for a device manufacturing process involving processing a pattern onto a substrate. Non-correctable error is used to help predict locations where defects are likely to be present, allowing improvements in metrology throughput. In an embodiment, non-correctable error information relates to imaging error due to limitations on the lens hardware, imaging slit size, and other physical characteristics of the lithography system. In an embodiment, non-correctable error information relates to imaging error induced by lens heating effects.

<claims>
1. A method for predicting a defect location for subsequent scanning by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), the method comprising:
obtaining non-correctable error information, the non-correctable error information being based on data from a photolithography system used to produce an image on a wafer to be scanned by the SEM;
predicting a defect location on the wafer based on the non-correctable error information; and sending the predicted defect location for delivery to the SEM.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the non-correctable error information is obtained for each exposure.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the predicting comprises using a defect detection algorithm comprising a computational model based on process parameters of a process used to produce the image and on layout parameters of the image.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the defect detection algorithm uses machine learning.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the non-correctable error information is an output of the photolithography system.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the non-correctable error information comprises aberration information including spherical aberration information and non-spherical aberration information.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the non-correctable error information comprises lens heating information.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the lens heating information is used by the defect detection algorithm to predict critical dimension or edge placement errors.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the predicting further comprises predicting a location of an error in the image produced by the photolithography system.
10. A system for inspection of a wafer, the wafer having an image produced with a
photolithography system including a projection optical system, the system comprising: a module configured and arranged to obtain non-correctable error information from the photolithography system;
a prediction module, configured and arranged to predict a defect location using a defect detection algorithm, using the non-correctable error information as an input; and
a transmission system configured and arranged to send the predicted defect location to an inspection tool.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the inspection tool is configured and arranged to inspect the wafer using the predicted imaging errors to determine selected areas of the wafer to be inspected.
12. The system of claim 10 wherein the prediction module uses non-correctable error information pertaining to heating effects on optical elements of the projection optical system.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the heating effects are modeled based on information regarding a mask and a illumination setting used in producing the image.
14. The system of claim 10, wherein the inspection tool is an SEM device coupled to the module, the prediction module and the transmission system, and wherein further the system is an SEM system.
15. A computer program product comprising a computer readable medium having instructions recorded thereon, the instructions when executed by a computer implementing the method of predicting a defect location for subsequent scanning by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), the method comprising:
obtaining non-correctable error information, the non-correctable error information being based on data from a photolithography system used to produce an image on a wafer to be scanned by the SEM;
predicting a defect location on the wafer based on the non-correctable error information; and sending the predicted defect location for delivery to the SEM.
