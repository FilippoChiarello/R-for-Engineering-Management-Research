DIALOGUE PROCESSING SYSTEM USING SPEECH ACT CONTROL AND OPERATION METHOD THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a dialogue processing system using speech act control, the dialogue processing system comprising: a main speech act unit which processes a free speech act and performs speech act control such that the free speech act returns to a main speech act, thereby processing a multi-turn dialogue in a consistent manner, and which processes a purposed utterance having a set purpose, for reaching a final dialogue objective; and a free speech act unit which processes a free utterance deviating from the purposed utterance and performs control such that the free utterance returns to the main speech act unit by searching for a node capable of returning to the purposed utterance.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A dialogue processing system using speech act control, comprising: a main speech act unit which processes a purposed utterance having a set purpose, and a free speech act unit which processes a free utterance deviating from a purposed utterance and performs speech act control to return to the main speech act unit by searching for a node capable of returning to a purposed utterance, wherein the free speech act unit performs control to return to the main speech act unit while processing a free utterance.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the main speech act unit comprises, a first main speech act unit which processes a purposed utterance of a multi-turn, and a second main speech act unit which identifies whether or not the purposed utterance is deviated and if a deviation of a purposed utterance occurs, changes authority to the speech act control of the free speech act unit.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the second main speech act unit checks whether or not an utterance of a user is deviated from a purposed utterance and changes authority to the speech act control of the free speech act unit when an utterance of a user is determined as a free utterance.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the free speech act unit comprises a first free speech act unit which processes a free utterance of a multi-turn, and a second free speech act unit which searches for a node capable of returning to a main speech act to generate one or more return inducing paths.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the first free speech act unit processes a free utterance of a multi-turn via a chatbot pool consisting of one or more chatbots or a dialogue flow graph and classifies each free speech act to select a chatbot or a response utterance.
6. The system of claim 4, wherein the second free speech act unit searches for a returnable node, and backtracks nodes that are connectable from a returnable node to a current response utterance, to generate a return inducing path.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the first free speech act unit searches for a response utterance corresponding to a last output in which a topic movement or a topic deviation from the main speech act unit occurred, and compares an utterance of a response utterance candidate with a return inducing path or a response utterance candidate with a common node.
8. An operation method of a dialogue processing system using speech act control, comprising the steps of: processing a purposed utterance having a set purpose, and processing a free utterance deviating from a purposed utterance and performing speech act control to return to a main speech act unit by searching for a node capable of returning to a purposed utterance, wherein the return to the main speech act unit is induced via control of the free speech act unit.
