<title>
Methods and systems for changing virtual models with elevation information from real world image processing
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and devices are disclosed which provide modification, editing, or extension of augmented reality and virtual reality representations of real world spaces using elevation information obtained from image processing of real world images.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of providing a virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) based on a pre-existing virtual model that is at risk of containing inaccurate, out-dated, or otherwise inconsistent data for describing a real world space, comprising receiving, with one or more processors, pre-existing virtual model data from one or more databases, the pre-existing virtual model data useable to generate VR or AR representations; receiving, with the one or more processors, one or more images or video of a real world space corresponding with a virtual world space described by the pre-existing virtual model data; performing image processing of the one or more images or video to determine an elevation value for one or more objects in the image or video; comparing each elevation value determined from the image processing with a corresponding elevation value in the virtual model data to determine one or more deltas for the one or more objects; and initiating a signal for controlling a virtual reality or augmented reality output by an output device using the one or more deltas, wherein each delta describes a discrepancy between a specific individual object's elevation in the virtual world versus in the real world as perceived using the captured one or more images or video.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of performing image processing comprises generating a first depth map using one or more images captured from a first perspective, generating a second depth map using one or more images captured from a second perspective different from the first perspective, and combining the first and second depth maps to create a 3D model describing objects or spaces in the one or more images visible from both the first and second perspectives.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of performing image processing comprises generating a single image depth map by dividing up a single image into homogenous patches, and applying a trained Markov Random Field to each patch to assign the patch a depth and orientation.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising updating information for specific individual objects as pinpointed updates that leave a remainder of the virtual model unchanged.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the pre-existing virtual model includes or consists of model data generated using either aerial or satellite data collection.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more objects include at least one of a building, structure, natural landform, or artificial landform.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein at least one of the one or more objects is a building.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein a delta for the building reflects changes in building elevation resulting from demolition or construction.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein each time a new video or image data is obtained it is processed to provide a new height/elevation value.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising capturing the one or more images or video of a real world space with multiple traffic cams.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the image processing comprises a combination of a scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm, a Structure-From-Motion (SFM) algorithm, and a Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) algorithm.
12. A system for providing a virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR), comprising one or more databases storing pre-existing virtual model data useable to generate VR or AR representations; one or more cameras for capturing an image or video of a real world space corresponding with a virtual world space described by the pre-existing virtual model data; one or more processors configured to execute computer-implemented instructions which, when executed by the processors, cause the processors to perform image processing of the image or video to determine an elevation value for one or more objects in the image or video, compare each elevation value determined from the image processing with a corresponding elevation value in the virtual model data to determine one or more deltas for the one or more objects; and initiate a signal for controlling a virtual reality or augmented reality output by an output device using the one or more deltas, wherein each delta describes a discrepancy between a specific individual object's elevation in the virtual world versus in the real world as perceived using the captured one or more images or video.
13. The system of claim 12, further comprising one or more output devices for displaying the object in a VR or AR representation using the delta.
14. The system of claim 12, wherein the step of performing image processing comprises generating a first depth map using one or more images captured from a first perspective, generating a second depth map using one or more images captured from a second perspective different from the first perspective, and combining the first and second depth maps to create a 3D model describing objects or spaces in the one or more images visible from both the first and second perspectives.
15. The system of claim 12, wherein the step of performing image processing comprises generating a single image depth map by dividing up a single image into homogenous patches, and applying a trained Markov Random Field to each patch to assign the patch a depth and orientation.
16. The system of claim 12, comprising further computer-implemented instructions which, when executed by the processors, cause the processors to update information for specific individual objects as pinpointed updates that leave a remainder of the virtual model unchanged.
17. The system of claim 12, wherein the pre-existing virtual model includes or consists of model data generated using either aerial or satellite data collection.
18. The system of claim 12, wherein the one or more objects include at least one of a building, structure, natural landform, or artificial landform.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein at least one of the one or more objects is a building.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein a delta for the building reflects changes in building elevation resulting from demolition or construction.
