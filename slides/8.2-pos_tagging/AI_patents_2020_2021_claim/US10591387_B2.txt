Signal classification
</title>

<abstract>
A computing device receives a first digital signal from a data acquisition system. It is determined that a first value includes in the first signal indicates an event. A second digital signal is received from the data acquisition system. It is determined that a second value included in the second signal includes a value that indicates the event, and that the event has occurred based at least in part on the first value, the second value, and a passage of a predetermined duration of time between a time of the first digital signal and a time of the second digital signal.

<claims>
1. A system, comprising; a plurality of mechanical components included in a physical machine; a communication bus included in the physical machine; a plurality of sensors included in the physical machine to provide digital signals, each of the sensors (i) disposed to obtain an analog signal measuring one or more of the mechanical components when the machine is in operation, (ii) configured to convert the obtained analog signal to one of the digital signals, and (iii) configured to output a converted digital signal to the communication bus, wherein the plurality of sensors includes a first sensor configured to output a first digital signal and a second sensor configured to output a second digital signal, the first digital signal including a first measurement of operation of one or more of the mechanical components at a first time, and the second digital including a second measurement of operation of the one or more mechanical components in the machine at a second time that is after the first time; and a first computer included in the physical machine, including a processor and a memory, the memory storing instructions executable by the processor such that the first computer is programmed to: receive the digital signals from the sensors via the communication bus; after determining that the first measurement meets a first threshold, then determine that the second measurement meets a second threshold; determine a time difference that is an amount of time passing between the first time and the second time; and upon determining that the time difference is greater than a predetermined amount of time, determine the occurrence of an event associated with the first and second measurements of operation of the one or more mechanical components in the machine; wherein the first data and the second data measure different data attributes.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising: a wireless network, wherein the first computer is further programmed to provide messages via the wireless network; and a second computer physically separated from the physical machine and programmed to: receive messages, including data about the event, from the first computer via the wireless network; and control the physical machine based on one or more received messages from the first computer.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein controlling the physical machine includes ceasing operation of the physical machine.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the first computer is further programmed to receive at least one third measurement between the first and second times.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the first computer is further programmed to record the first time as the event start time and the second time as the event end time.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the first computer is further programmed to provide event data to a fact stack of a rules engine.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the first computer is further programmed to receive a third measurement from a second sensor, the third measurement including data indicating a status of one of the one or more mechanical components.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the first and second thresholds are a same value.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the machine is a vehicle.
