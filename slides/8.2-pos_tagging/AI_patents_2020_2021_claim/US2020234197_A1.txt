<title>
DETERMINANTAL REINFORCED LEARNING IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems for selecting and performing group actions include selecting parameters for an approximated action-value function, which determines a reward value associated with a particular group action taken from a particular state, using a determinant of a parameter matrix for the action-value function. A group action is selected using the approximated action-value function and the selected parameters. Agents are triggered to perform respective tasks in the group action.
