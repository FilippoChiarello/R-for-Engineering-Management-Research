<title>
System for decomposing events from managed infrastructures with semantic curvature
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and system are provided for decomposing events from managed infrastructures. The system decomposes events from a managed infrastructure and includes a first engine that receives data from a managed infrastructure which includes managed infrastructure physical hardware. The infrastructure physical hardware supports the flow and processing of information. A second engine determines common characteristics of events and produces clusters of events relating to the failure of errors in the managed infrastructure. Membership in a cluster indicates a common factor of the events that is a failure or an actionable problem in the physical hardware managed infrastructure directed to support the flow and processing of information. Events are produced that relate to the managed infrastructure. The events are converted into words and subsets used to group the events that relate to failures or errors in the managed infrastructure, including the managed infrastructure physical hardware. The events have textural context. Semantic meaning is applied to the textual context of the events. A change to a managed infrastructure physical hardware component is made.

<claims>
1. A system for decomposing events from a managed infrastructure, comprising: one or more processors; a memory including instructions that when executed by the one or more processors executes the following: a first engine receiving data from a managed infrastructure that includes managed infrastructure physical hardware which supports the flow and processing of information; a second engine determining common characteristics of events and produces clusters of events relating to the failure of errors in the managed infrastructure, where membership in a cluster indicates a common factor of the events that is a failure or an actionable problem in the physical hardware managed infrastructure directed to supporting the flow and processing of information, and producing events that relate to the managed infrastructure while converting the events into words and subsets used to group the events that relate to failures or errors in the managed infrastructure, including the managed infrastructure physical hardware, the events having textural context; applying semantic meaning applied to the textual context of the events, the semantic meaning determining a semantic distance with a relationship between a lexical distance and the semantic distance being determined, where the lexical distance is a distance of components in a string, the string including a plurality of components that are selected from at least one of: letters and numbers: and letters, the string selected from, one or more of: a word; a plurality of words; and a sequence of components; and wherein a change to a managed infrastructure physical hardware component is made based on the applied semantic meaning.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the lexical distance is a distance of every component in a string.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the string includes a plurality of components.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the components are selected from at least one of: letters and numbers.
5. The system of claim 3, wherein the components are letters.
6. The system of claim 3, wherein the lexical distance is a distance between every component in the string.
7. The system of claim 5, wherein the lexical distance is a distance between every letter in the string.
8. The system of claim 3, wherein the string is one or more words.
9. The system of claim 3, wherein the string is a word.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the string is a plurality of words.
11. The system of claim 6, wherein the string represents a sequence of components.
12. The system of claim 6, wherein a lexical distance of components is determined.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the components are selected from: a word, a plurality of words; and a number.
14. The system of claim 1, wherein a relationship between a lexical distance and the semantic distance is determined.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein labelled data is used to determine the relationship between a lexical distance and the semantic distance.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein labelled data is when something is semantically close in distance.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein labelled data is used to generate a multi-dimensional surface.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the multi-dimensional surface captures a geometry of a distance relationship between the lexical and semantic distances.
19. The system of claim 16, wherein labelled data is used to generate a multi-dimensional distance.
20. The system of claim 17 wherein once the multi-distance surface is determined a semantic distance is made for a new event from the new event's lexical distance.
21. The system of claim 20, wherein a metric tensor is used to determine the semantic distance of the new event.
