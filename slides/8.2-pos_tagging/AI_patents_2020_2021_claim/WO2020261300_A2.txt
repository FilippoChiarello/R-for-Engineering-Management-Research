METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION OF FLUE GAS DESULPHURIZATION (FGD) UNIT
</title>

<abstract>
State of the art techniques used for Flue Gas Desulpharization (FGD) process monitoring fail to comprehend the relationship between various process parameters, which is crucial in determining the performance of a FGD process being monitored. The disclosure herein generally relates to industrial process monitoring, and, more particularly, to a method and system for performance optimization of Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) Unit. The system identifies Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) associated with the process being monitored, and identifies parameters associated with each KPI. This information is used to generate several predictive models, from which a predictive model having the highest value of composite model score amongst the predictive models is selected as the predictive model for processing the input data, which is then used to perform optimization of the FGD process.
