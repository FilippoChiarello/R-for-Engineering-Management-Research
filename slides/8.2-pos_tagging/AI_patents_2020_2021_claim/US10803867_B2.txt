Dialogue system and domain determination method
</title>

<abstract>
A dialogue system, comprises an input unit configured to acquire utterance contents of a user in a dialogue; a mode determining unit configured to determine, based on the utterance contents acquired by the input unit, whether a mode of the dialogue is task-oriented or non-task-oriented; a plurality of intention understanding units each corresponding to a specific domain; and a domain determining unit configured to determine, when the mode of the dialogue is task-oriented, a domain of the dialogue based on a result of intention understanding of the utterance contents performed using each of the plurality of intention understanding units.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A dialogue system, comprising: an input unit configured to acquire utterance contents of a user in a dialogue; a mode determining unit configured to determine, based on the utterance contents acquired by the input unit, whether a mode of the dialogue is task-oriented or non-task-oriented; a plurality of intention understanding units each corresponding to a specific domain; and a domain determining unit configured to transmit, when the mode of the dialogue is task-oriented, the utterance contents to all of the plurality of intention understanding units, and determine a domain of the dialogue based on a result of intention understanding of the utterance contents performed using each of the plurality of intention understanding units, and determine, when the mode of the dialogue is non-task-oriented, the domain of the dialogue prior to transmitting the utterance contents to any of the intention understanding units.
2. The dialogue system according to claim 1, wherein each of the plurality of intention understanding units outputs a certainty factor of the utterance contents being consistent with each of a plurality of intentions determined in advance.
3. The dialogue system according to claim 2, wherein each of the plurality of intention understanding units vectorizes the utterance contents, and determines, based on a distance between a position of the utterance contents and a center of gravity position of an intention determined in advance in a vector space, a certainty factor corresponding to the intention.
4. The dialogue system according to claim 2, wherein each of the plurality of intention understanding units outputs a certainty factor for a prescribed number of intentions starting from an intention with a highest certainty factor, and the prescribed number is common among the plurality of intention understanding units.
5. The dialogue system according to claim 2, wherein each of the plurality of intention understanding units calculates the certainty factor based on same calculation criteria.
6. The dialogue system according to claim 2, wherein the domain determining unit determines, as the domain of the dialogue, a domain corresponding to an intention understanding unit having output a highest certainty factor.
7. The dialogue system according to claim 1, wherein the domain determining unit estimates a domain from a word string included in the utterance contents when the mode of the dialogue is non-task-oriented.
8. The dialogue system according to claim 1, wherein when the mode of the dialogue is switched between the task-oriented mode and the non-task-oriented mode, the domain determining unit determines a domain after the switch by taking into consideration a domain before the switch.
9. The dialogue system according to claim 1, wherein the input unit includes: a speech input unit configured to acquire uttered speech of the user; and a speech recognizing unit configured to apply speech recognition to the uttered speech to acquire the utterance contents.
10. The dialogue system according to claim 1, wherein the input unit acquires a text of utterance contents from the user.
11. A domain determination method carried out by a dialogue system, the domain determination method comprising: an input step of acquiring utterance contents of a user in a dialogue; a mode determining step of determining, based on the utterance contents acquired in the input step, whether a mode of the dialogue is task-oriented or non-task-oriented; an intention understanding step of performing intention understanding by a plurality of intention understanding units each corresponding to a specific domain; and a domain determining step of determining a domain of the dialogue, wherein when the dialogue is task-oriented, the utterance contents are transmitted to all of the plurality of intention understanding units, and the domain of the dialogue is determined based on a result of intention understanding performed using the intention understanding units each corresponding to the specific domain, and when the mode of the dialogue is non-task-oriented, the domain of the dialogue is determined prior to transmitting the utterance contents to any of the intention understanding units.
