AUTOMATED SPEECH RECOGNITION CONFIDENCE CLASSIFIER
</title>

<abstract>
A method of enhancing an automated speech recognition confidence classifier includes receiving a set of baseline confidence features from one or more decoded words, deriving word embedding confidence features from the baseline confidence features, joining the baseline confidence features with word embedding confidence features to create a feature vector, and executing the confidence classifier to generate a confidence score, wherein the confidence classifier is trained with a set of training examples having labeled features corresponding to the feature vector.

<claims>
1. A method of enhancing an automated speech recognition confidence classifier comprising: receiving a set of baseline confidence features from one or more decoded words; deriving word embedding confidence features from the baseline confidence features; joining the baseline confidence features with word embedding confidence features to create a feature vector; and executing the confidence classifier to generate a confidence score, wherein the confidence classifier is trained with a set of training examples having labeled features corresponding to the feature vector.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the word embedding confidence features comprise character embeddings.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein the character embeddings comprise less than 26 embeddings comprising letters.
4. The method of claim 2 wherein the character embedding for a word comprises a vector having values for each letter consisting of the count of the number of each letter in the word.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the word embedding confidence features comprise phone embeddings.
6. The method of claim 5 wherein the phone embeddings comprise monophones selected from a dictionary comprising 40 or fewer monophones.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein the word embedding confidence features comprise character embeddings and phone embeddings.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein the feature vector further comprises GLOVE embeddings.
9. The method of claim 1 wherein the confidence classifier is trained for word-level as well an utterance-level classification.
10. The method of claim 1 wherein the baseline features comprise two or more of acoustic-model scores, background-model scores, silence-model scores, noise-model scores, language model scores, and duration features.
11. A machine-readable storage device having instructions for execution by a processor of a machine to cause the processor to perform operations to generate a confidence score for a word or utterance, the operations comprising: receiving a set of baseline confidence features from one or more decoded words; deriving word embedding confidence features from the baseline confidence features; joining the baseline confidence features with word embedding confidence features to create a feature vector; and executing the confidence classifier to generate a confidence score, wherein the confidence classifier is trained with a set of training examples having labeled features corresponding to the feature vector.
12. The device of claim 11 wherein the word embedding confidence features comprise character embeddings.
13. The device of claim 12 wherein the character embeddings comprise 26 or fewer embeddings comprising letters in an alphabet.
14. The device of claim 12 wherein the character embedding for a word comprises a vector having values for each letter consisting of the count of the number of each letter in the word.
15. The device of claim 11 wherein the word embedding confidence features comprise phone embeddings including monophones selected from a dictionary comprising 40 or fewer monophones.
16. The device of claim 11 wherein the word embedding confidence features comprise character embeddings and phone embeddings.
17. The device of claim 11 wherein the confidence classifier is trained for word-level as well an utterance-level classification and wherein the baseline features comprise two or more of acoustic-model scores, background-model scores, silence-model scores, noise-model scores, language model scores, and duration features.
18. A device comprising: a processor; and a memory device coupled to the processor and having a program stored thereon for execution by the processor to perform operations comprising: receiving a set of baseline confidence features from one or more decoded words; deriving word embedding confidence features from the baseline confidence features; joining the baseline confidence features with word embedding confidence features to create a feature vector; and executing the confidence classifier to generate a confidence score, wherein the confidence classifier is trained with a set of training examples having labeled features corresponding to the feature vector.
19. The device of claim 18 wherein the word embedding confidence features comprise one or more of character embeddings and phone embeddings including monophones.
20. The device of claim 18 wherein the confidence classifier is trained for word-level as well an utterance-level classification and wherein the baseline features comprise two or more of acoustic-model scores, background-model scores, silence-model scores, noise-model scores, language model scores, and duration features.
