<title>
PREDICTING NETWORK STATES FOR ANSWERING WHAT-IF SCENARIO OUTCOMES
</title>

<abstract>
In one embodiment, a device constructs a set of controlled what-if input parameters for evaluating a what-if scenario in a network. The device uses the set of controlled what-if input parameters and state data indicative of a current state of the network as input to a network state model. The network state model predicts values for the state data conditioned on the what-if input parameters. The device predicts a key performance indicator (KPI) in the network by using the predicted values for the state data from the network state model as input to a machine learning-based KPI prediction model. The device initiates a routing change in the network based in part on the predicted KPI.

3. The method as in claim 2, wherein initiating the routing change in the network based in part on the predicted KPI comprises: determining that the predicted KPI will satisfy a service level agreement associated with the traffic; and proactively rerouting the traffic from the first tunnel onto the second tunnel, in advance of the predicted failure of the first tunnel.
4. The method as in claim 1, wherein the network state model comprises a regression model trained to predict values for the state data conditioned on the what-if input parameters.
5. The method as in claim 1, wherein the GAN concatenates the set of controlled what-if input parameters and the state data into a conditioning signal, to predict the values for the state data conditioned on the what-if input parameters.
