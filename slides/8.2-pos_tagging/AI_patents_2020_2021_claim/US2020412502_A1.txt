TRANSMITTING REFERENCE SIGNALS IN 5G OR OTHER NEXT GENERATION COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for transmitting reference signals (RSs) having respective signal patterns in the coding chain to improve performance of multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) communication systems are presented. For downlink transmissions, an RS management component (RSMC) of a network node can determine a first resource element (RE) pattern for RSs of a first cell and a second RE pattern for RSs of a second cell in the time, frequency, or code domain. RSMC can utilize an adaptive interleaver in the coding chain to improve performance of MIMO systems. RSMC can facilitate configuring user equipment (UE) about the interleaver at the RE domain or as part of virtual resource block (VRB)-to-physical resource block (PRB) domain. RSMC can thereby reduce interference on RSs from other co-channel RSs, thereby improving channel estimation performance for channel-state-information estimation and data detection by the UE, and achieving significant gains in link and system throughputs.
