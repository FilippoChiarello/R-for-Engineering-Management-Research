MACHINE LEARNING METHOD AND MOBILE ROBOT
</title>

<abstract>
A machine learning method includes: a first learning step which is performed in a phase before a neural network is installed in a mobile robot and in which a stationary first obstacle is placed in a set space and the first obstacle is placed at different positions using simulation so that the neural network repeatedly learns a path from a starting point to the destination which avoids the first obstacle; and a second learning step which is performed in a phase after the neural network is installed in the mobile robot and in which, when the mobile robot recognizes a second obstacle that operates around the mobile robot in a space where the mobile robot moves, the neural network repeatedly learns a path to the destination which avoids the second obstacle every time the mobile robot recognizes the second obstacle.

<claims>
1. A machine learning method for a neural network that causes a computer to function to output a path for a mobile robot to move to a destination, based on provided map information and detected moving body information, the method comprising: a first learning step which is performed in a phase before the neural network is installed in the mobile robot and in which a stationary first obstacle is placed in a set space and the first obstacle is placed at different positions using simulation such that the neural network repeatedly learns a path from a starting point to the destination which avoids the first obstacle; and a second learning step which is performed in a phase after the neural network is installed in the mobile robot and in which, when the mobile robot recognizes a second obstacle that operates around the mobile robot in a space where the mobile robot moves, the neural network repeatedly learns a path to the destination which avoids the second obstacle every time the mobile robot recognizes the second obstacle.
2. The machine leaning method according to claim 1, wherein in the second learning step, the neural network learns a path indicated by a user as at least a part of the path to the destination.
3. The machine learning method according to claim 2, wherein in the second learning step, the path indicated by the user is obtained based on a voice of the user.
4. The machine learning method according to claim 2, wherein in the second learning step, the path indicated by the user is obtained based on an action of the user.
5. The machine learning method according to claim 2, wherein in the second learning step, the path indicated by the user is obtained based on a force that is applied to the mobile robot by the user.
6. The machine learning method according to claim 1, wherein the second learning step includes a case where a virtual second obstacle is generated and the mobile robot is caused to recognize the virtual second obstacle.
7. The machine leaning method according to claim 1, wherein a moving plane on which the mobile robot moves in the set space is represented by m by n cells, n and m being a natural number of 2 or greater, and the first obstacle and the second obstacle are recognized by the mobile robot as obstacles that occupies the cells.
8. A mobile robot in which a learned neural network is installed, the learned neural network having learned by the machine learning method according to claim 1, the mobile robot comprising: an obtaining unit configured to obtain map information describing the first obstacle and a destination; a detection unit configured to detect the second obstacle that operates around the mobile robot; a calculation unit configured to input the map information and the destination which are obtained by the obtaining unit and detection information on the second obstacle detected by the detection unit to the learned neural network to calculate a path to the destination; and a movement control unit configured to control the mobile robot to move along the path calculated by the calculation unit.
9. The mobile robot according to claim 8, wherein the calculation unit is configured to update the path every time the detection unit detects the second obstacle.
