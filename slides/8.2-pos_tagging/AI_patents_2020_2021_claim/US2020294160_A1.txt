ESTIMATING PERFORMANCE OF PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
An energy evaluation system includes an energy system modeling framework and an Application Program Interface (API) as part of the energy system evaluation framework. The energy evaluation system can be configured to query a simulation application program interface (API) with PV system configuration parameters as arguments, generate a shade loss time series based on the system configuration parameters, simulate energy output for the PV system based on the shade loss time series, and output energy aggregations based on the simulation.
