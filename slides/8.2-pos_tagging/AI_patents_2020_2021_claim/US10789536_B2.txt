<title>
Using Trie structures to efficiently identify similarities among topical subjects
</title>

<abstract>
A method and associated systems for identifying inputs to be used by a decision-support application. The decision-support application requests from the input-selection system a set of topics of interest that have experienced similar trends in public interest over a specified period of time, subject to certain constraints and confidence factors. In response, the system uses content retrieved from online news and social-media sources to identify common topics and past trends of public interest in each of those topics. The system then retrieves, from a more robust set of sources that include online references and encyclopedias, content related to the most popular topics and their related qualities. The system builds a Trie data structure for each topic and its related qualities and uses properties of Trie structures to efficiently identify the most similar Tries. The system then returns to the decision-support application the topics that correspond to the most similar Tries.
