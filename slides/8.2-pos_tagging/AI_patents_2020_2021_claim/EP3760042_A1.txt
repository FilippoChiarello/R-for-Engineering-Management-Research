AUTOMATIC FEEDING ASSISTANCE DEVICE, AUTOMATIC FEEDING ASSISTANCE METHOD, AND RECORDING MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
In order to solve a conventional problem that it is not easy to place an order, at a preferable timing, for food that is to be supplied to fish using an automatic feeder, an automatic feeding assistance apparatus includes: a remaining amount information acquiring unit that acquires remaining amount information regarding a remaining amount of food in an automatic feeder configured to supply food to fish; a judging unit that judges whether or not the remaining amount of food is so small that a predetermined condition is satisfied by the remaining amount information; and a transmitting unit that, in a case in which the judging unit judges that the remaining amount of food is so small that the predetermined condition is satisfied, transmits ordering information regarding placing an order for food. Accordingly, it is possible to place an order, at a preferable timing, for food that is to be supplied to fish using an automatic feeder, or assist a user in placing the order.

<claims>
1. An automatic feeding assistance apparatus comprising: a remaining amount information acquiring unit that acquires remaining amount information regarding a remaining amount of food in an automatic feeder configured to supply food to fish; a judging unit that judges whether or not the remaining amount of food is so small that a predetermined condition is satisfied by the remaining amount information; and a transmitting unit that, in a case in which the judging unit judges that the remaining amount of food is so small that the predetermined condition is satisfied, transmits ordering information regarding placing an order for food.
2. The automatic feeding assistance apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a supplier information storage unit in which supplier information for specifying a supplier of food is stored, wherein the transmitting unit transmits the ordering information to the supplier specified with the supplier information.
3. The automatic feeding assistance apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a culturist information storage unit in which culturist information for specifying a culturist of fish is stored, wherein the transmitting unit transmits the ordering information that prompts for placing an order for food, to the culturist specified with the culturist information.
4. The automatic feeding assistance apparatus according to claim 1,
wherein the remaining amount information acquiring unit receives remaining amount information from the two or more automatic feeders, and
the automatic feeding assistance apparatus further comprises: a statistical processing unit that performs statistical processing on two or more pieces of remaining amount information received from two or more automatic feeders, thereby acquiring a statistical processing result; and a statistical processing result output unit that outputs the statistical processing result.
5. The automatic feeding assistance apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a fish status information acquiring unit that acquires fish status information indicating a status of fish that are being cultivated, using the remaining amount information acquired by the remaining amount information acquiring unit; and a fish status information output unit that outputs the fish status information.
6. The automatic feeding assistance apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the fish status information is fish type information indicating the type of fish, or number information regarding the number of fish that are to be brought to the market.
7. The automatic feeding assistance apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a parameter acquiring unit that acquires one or more parameters regarding a movement of a fish; and a predicting unit that acquires a prediction result, which is a result obtained by predicting one or both of a feeding amount and a feeding time, using the one or more parameters.
8. The automatic feeding assistance apparatus according to claim 7, wherein one of the one or more parameters is a fish body velocity obtained by dividing a movement velocity of a fish by a length of the fish.
9. An automatic feeding assistance method realized using a remaining amount information acquiring unit that acquires remaining amount information regarding a remaining amount of food in an automatic feeder configured to supply food to fish, a judging unit, and a transmitting unit, comprising: a judging step of the judging unit judging whether or not the remaining amount of food is so small that a predetermined condition is satisfied by the remaining amount information; and a transmitting step of the transmitting unit, in a case in which the judging unit judges that the remaining amount of food is so small that the predetermined condition is satisfied, transmitting ordering information regarding placing an order for food.
10. A computer-accessible storage medium on which a program is stored, comprising a remaining amount information acquiring unit that acquires remaining amount information regarding a remaining amount of food in an automatic feeder configured to supply food to fish, the program causing a computer to function as: a judging unit that judges whether or not the remaining amount of food is so small that a predetermined condition is satisfied by the remaining amount information; and a transmitting unit that, in a case in which the judging unit judges that the remaining amount of food is so small that the predetermined condition is satisfied, transmits ordering information regarding placing an order for food.
