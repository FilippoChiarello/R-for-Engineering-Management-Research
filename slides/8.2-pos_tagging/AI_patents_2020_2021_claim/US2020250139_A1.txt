METHODS, PERSONAL DATA ANALYSIS SYSTEM FOR SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION DETECTION, LINKING AND PURPOSES OF PERSONAL DATA USAGE PREDICTION
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for personal data classification, linkage and purpose of processing prediction are provided. The system for personal data classification includes an entity extraction module for extracting personal data from one or more data repositories in a computer network or cloud infrastructure, a linkage module coupled to the entity extraction module, a linkage module coupled to the entity extraction module and a processing prediction module. The entity extraction module performs entity recognition from the structured, semi-structured and unstructured records in the one or more data repositories. The linkage module uses graph-based methodology to link the personal data to one or more individuals. And the purpose prediction module includes a feature extraction module a purpose of processing prediction module, wherein the feature extraction module extracts both context features and record's features from records in the one or more data repositories, and the purpose of processing prediction module predicts a unique or multiple purpose of processing of the personal data.

A system for personal data classification comprising: an entity extraction module for extracting personal data from one or more data repositories in a computer network or cloud infrastructure, wherein the entity extraction module performs entity recognition from structured, semi-structured and unstructured records in the one or more data repositories; a linkage module coupled to the entity extraction module and using graph-based methodology to link the personal data to one or more individuals; and a purpose prediction module comprising: a feature extraction module, wherein the feature extraction module extracts both context features and record's features from records in the one or more data repositories; and a purpose of processing prediction module for predicting a unique or multiple purpose of processing of the personal data.
2. The system for personal data classification in accordance with claim 1 further comprising an anomaly detection for detecting data breaches in response to the predicted purpose of processing the personal data.
3. The system for personal data classification in accordance with claim 1 wherein the entity extraction module performs entity recognition using unsupervised deep learning and deterministic learning methodology
4. The system for personal data classification in accordance with claim 1 wherein the entity extraction module performs entity recognition to extract more than fifty entity types with their further characterization.
5. The system for personal data classification in accordance with claim 1 wherein the record's features include user rights, metadata, language, document date and document owner.
6. The system for personal data classification in accordance with claim 1 wherein the purpose prediction module is coupled to the linkage module and further uses the link of the personal data to one or more individuals to predict the unique or multiple purpose of processing of the personal data.
7. A method for personal data extraction comprising: scanning one or more documents in one or more data repositories in a computer network or cloud infrastructure, the one or more documents comprising structured, semi-structured or unstructured documents; performing entity recognition in the structured, semi-structured and unstructured documents; and extracting features from the structured, semi-structured and unstructured documents using deep learning and deterministic learning methodologies.
8. The method in accordance with claim 7 wherein the extracting features comprises extracting more than fifty entity types and further categorization of personal data in the one or more documents.
9.
