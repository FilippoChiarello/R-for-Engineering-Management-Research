<title>
A DIAGNOSTIC AND PROGNOSTIC TEST FOR MULTIPLE CANCER TYPES BASED ON TRANSCRIPT PROFILING
</title>

<abstract>
An example method of bioinformatics is described herein. The method can include receiving RNA expression data for a sample of tumor, determining a global ribosomal protein transcript (RPT) expression profile for the sample based on the RNA expression data, and identifying a tissue of origin and/or other clinical features for the sample based on the global RPT expression profile for the sample.

<claims>
1. A method of bioinformatics, comprising: receiving RNA expression data for a sample of tumor; determining a global ribosomal protein transcript (RPT) expression profile for the sample based on the RNA expression data; and identifying a tissue of origin for the sample based on the global RPT expression profile for the sample.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein determining a global ribosomal protein transcript (RPT) expression profile for the sample comprises calculating a respective relative expression for each of a plurality of RPTs.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the plurality of RPTs comprise RPTs for approximately eighty ribosomal proteins (RPs).
4. The method of claim 2, wherein a respective relative expression comprises a percentage contribution of an individual RPT to the total expression of the plurality of RPTs.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying a tissue of origin for the sample comprises using a classifier model.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the classifier model differentiates tumor tissue from normal tissue.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein the classifier model differentiates between different types of tumor tissue.
8. The method of claim 5, wherein the classifier model differentiates between subtypes of the same tumor tissue.
9. The method of claim 5, further comprising constructing the classifier model using respective global RPT expression profiles for a plurality of known tissues.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein identifying a tissue of origin for the sample comprises comparing quantitative differences between the global RPT expression profile for the sample and one or more of the respective global RPT expression profiles for the known tissues.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the tissue of origin for the sample is identified based on dysregulation of the relative expression of one or more ribosomal proteins (RPs).
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the RPs comprise one or more of RPL3, RPL5, RPL8, RPL13, RPL30, RPL36, RPL38, RPL13, RPS4X, or RPS20.
13. The method of claim 1, further comprising providing a diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment recommendation based on the tissue of origin for the sample.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein providing a diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment recommendation comprises providing at least one of a clinical parameter, a molecular marker, or a tumor phenotype.
15. The method of claim 13, further comprising sub-classifying the tissue of origin for the sample based on the global RPT expression profile for the sample.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment recommendation is provided based on a sub-class of the tissue of origin for the sample.
17. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving the sample of tumor; extracting RNA from the sample; isolating a plurality of RPTs from the extracted RNA; and obtaining the RNA expression data from the isolated RPTs.
18. The method of claim 1, wherein the RNA expression data comprises RNA-seq data.
19. The method of claim 1, wherein the RNA expression data comprises microarray data.
20. The method of claim 1, wherein the tumor is an undifferentiated tumor.
21. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving respective RNA expression data and respective clinical information for each of a plurality of tumors from a database; determining respective global RPT expression profiles for the tumors in the database based on the respective RNA expression data; identifying recurring patterns of RPT expression among the tumors in the database; and comparing the recurring patterns of RPT expression with the respective clinical parameters.
22. The method of claim 21, wherein identifying a tissue of origin for the sample comprises comparing the global RPT expression profile for the sample to the respective global RPT expression profiles for the tumors in the database.
23. The method of claim 21, wherein identifying recurring patterns of RPT expression among tumors in the database further comprises applying a machine learning model that analyzes linear and non-linear relationships among the respective relative expression for each of the plurality of RPTs.
24. The method of claim 23, wherein the machine learning model is t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).
25. The method of claim 24, further comprising graphically displaying the global RPT expression pattern for the sample with clusters using a three-dimensional (3D) map.
26. A method of bioinformatics, comprising: determining a global ribosomal protein transcript (RPT) expression profile for a sample of tumor, and identifying a tissue of origin for the sample based on the global RPT expression pattern for the sample.
27. A method of bioinformatics, comprising: receiving RNA expression data for a sample of tumor; determining a global ribosomal protein transcript (RPT) expression profile for the sample based on the RNA expression data; and providing a diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment recommendation based on the global RPT expression profile.
28. The method of claim 27, wherein providing a diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment recommendation comprises providing at least one of a clinical parameter, a molecular marker, or a tumor phenotype.
29. A method of bioinformatics, comprising: receiving RNA expression data for a sample of tumor; determining a global cholesterol biosynthesis transcript expression profile for the sample based on the RNA expression data; and providing a diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment recommendation based on the cholesterol biosynthesis transcript expression profile.
30. 30-39. (canceled)
40. A method of bioinformatics, comprising: receiving RNA expression data for a sample of tumor; determining a global fatty acid oxidation (FAO) transcript expression profile for the sample based on the RNA expression data; and providing a diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment recommendation based on the FAO transcript expression profile.
41. 41-48. (canceled)
