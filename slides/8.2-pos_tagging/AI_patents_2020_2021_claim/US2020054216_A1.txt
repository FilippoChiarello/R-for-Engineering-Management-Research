<title>
SYSTEM OF MACHINE-LEARNING MEDIATED IMAGE ANALYSIS TO AID PREDICTIVE MRI-GUIDED HYPERTHERMIA TREATMENTS
</title>

<abstract>
A new generation of precision medicine with interfaces processing the predictive feedback over the course of hyperthermia treatment sessions is provided. Implementation of MR-thermometry measurements and real-time spatial imaging can resolve many of the limiting factors currently associated with hyperthermia treatment. More significantly, implementation of artificial intelligence (machine learning) mediated image analysis and database construction can provide the international community with standards for monitoring, and thermal dose calibration.
