INTELLIGENT LIGHTING CONTROL SYSTEM MULTI-WAY SCHEMES FOR SWITCH BASES
</title>

<abstract>
A multi-way circuit having a plurality of base modules may be used in multi-way schemes for lighting control devices. The multi-way circuit may operate with a controller and the base modules of a lighting control system to provide a fully functional, multi-way toggle circuit, even when the switches installed in the base module are not paired or in their off modes. The multi-way toggle circuit can be defined as follows: if any button in the circuit is pressed (indicating a desire to change the load state), then the load toggles its state between on and off.
