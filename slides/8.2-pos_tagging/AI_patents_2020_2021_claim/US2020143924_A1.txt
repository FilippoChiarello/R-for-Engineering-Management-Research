<title>
A SUBJECT-SPECIFIC SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PREVENTION OF BODY ADAPTATION FOR CHRONIC TREATMENT OF DISEASE
</title>

<abstract>
There are provided herein a system and a computer implemented method for preventing, mitigating or treating partial/complete loss of effect of one or more drugs or medical devices administered to or used by a subject in need thereof due to adaptation, tolerance, and/or tachyphylaxis, and/or for preventing, mitigating or treating non-responsiveness to one or more drugs, maximizing therapeutic effect of one or more drugs, or for improving target or non-target organ/organs response to therapy, the system/method include (processing circuit configured to): receiving a plurality of physiological or pathological parameters of the subject; applying a machine learning algorithm on the plurality of physiological or pathological parameters; and determining a subject-specific administration regimen of a drug or a medical treatment, wherein the administration regimen comprises drug administration parameters, cell/tissue/organ stimulation parameters, adjuvant parameters or any combination thereof; wherein the administration regimen is irregular.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method for preventing, mitigating or treating partial/complete loss of effect of one or more drugs or medical devices administered to or used by a subject in need thereof due to adaptation, tolerance, and/or tachyphylaxis, and/or for preventing, mitigating or treating non-responsiveness to one or more drugs, maximizing therapeutic effect of one or more drugs, or for improving target or non-target organ/organs response to therapy, the method comprising: receiving a plurality of physiological or pathological parameters of the subject; applying a machine learning algorithm on the plurality of physiological or pathological parameters; and determining a subject-specific administration regimen of a drug or a medical treatment, wherein the administration regimen comprises drug administration parameters, cell/tissue/organ stimulation parameters, adjuvant parameters or any combination thereof; wherein the administration regimen is irregular.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising updating the administration regimen based on newly received values of the plurality of physiological or pathological parameters.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the medical treatment is organ stimulation and wherein the administration regimen comprises cell/tissue/organ stimulation parameters.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising updating the stimulation parameters based on data being continuously learned from the subject and/or by other users.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning algorithm further considers personal data selected from the group consisting of: age, weight, periodic caloric intake and output, gender, ethnicity, geography, pathological history/state, temperature, metabolic rate, glucose levels, blood tests and any physiological or any pathological or physiological biomarkers or parameters that can be measured, that are directly or indirectly associated with the physiological target or with the chronic disease.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein at least one of the physiological or pathological parameters is obtained from a sensor.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising notifying the subject regarding the administration regimen; wherein the notifying comprises informing about time, dose and/or method of administration of one or more drugs and/or one or more adjuvant drugs.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the notifying is in real time.
9. The method of any one of claim 1, further comprising stimulating a tissue or an organ of the subject utilizing a wearable/swallowed/implanted device.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising administering one or more drugs to the subject.
11. The method of claim 1, for treatment of obesity, infectious, metabolic, endocrinology, malignant, immune-mediated, inflammatory condition, inborn error of metabolism, pain, microbiome-related disorders, neurological disease, fibrosis in any organ, any type of disease in which circadian rhythm is relevant or any combination thereof.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the drug is a drug that targets microtubules.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the is a drug that target glycosphingolipids.
14. A system for preventing, mitigating or treating partial/complete loss of effect of one or more drug or medical devices administered to or used by a subject in need thereof due to adaptation, tolerance, and/or tachyphylaxis, and/or for preventing, mitigating or treating non-responsiveness to one or more drugs, maximizing therapeutic effect of one or more drugs, improving target or non-target organ/organs response to therapy, the system comprising a processing circuit configured to: receive a plurality of physiological or pathological parameters of the subject; apply a machine learning algorithm on the plurality of physiological or pathological parameters; and determine a subject-specific administration regimen of the one or more drugs or medical treatments, wherein the administration regimen comprises drug administration parameters, cell/tissue/organ stimulation parameters, adjuvant parameters or any combination thereof; wherein the administration regimen is irregular.
15. The system of claim 14, further comprising a stimulation inducer.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the stimulation inducer comprises a pill, configured to be swallowed, transplanted or otherwise reach a target body region.
17. The system of claim 15, wherein the stimulation inducer comprises a wearable device, configured to be located on/near a target body region.
18. The system of claim 15, wherein the stimulation inducer is configured to affect a stimulation by providing physical movement, mechanical stimulation, electric stimulation, electromagnetic signal emission, temperature alteration, ultrasound stimulation or any combination thereof.
19. The system of claim 14, further comprising an alert module configured to provide instructions to a user regarding a change in the administration regimen of the one or more drugs or medical treatments.
20. The system of claim 19, further comprising a communication unit configured to deliver the alert, wherein the alert is operable via a cloud based alert system connected to a medical device or to a drug box configured to provide instructions to a user regarding the administration regimen of the one or more drugs or medical treatments.
21. (canceled)
