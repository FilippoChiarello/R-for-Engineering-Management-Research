SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR TRACKING A TOOL IN AN ULTRASOUND IMAGE
</title>

<abstract>
The invention provides a method for monitoring a location of a tool in an ultrasound image. The method includes acquiring a plurality of 2D ultrasound images by way of an ultrasound transducer, wherein at least one of the plurality of 2D ultrasound images comprises a part of the tool and generating a 3D ultrasound image from said plurality of 2D ultrasound images. A first location of the tool is then identified within the 3D ultrasound image. An additional 2D ultrasound image, and location information relating to the location of the ultrasound transducer during capture of the additional 2D ultrasound image, is then acquired and the 3D ultrasound image updated based on the additional 2D ultrasound image and the location information. A location of the tool with respect to the additional 2D ultrasound image is then identified within the updated 3D ultrasound image based only on imaging data of the updated 3D ultrasound image.

<claims>
1. A method (100) for monitoring a location of a tool in an ultrasound image, the method comprising:
acquiring (110) a plurality of 2D ultrasound images by way of an ultrasound transducer, wherein at least one of the plurality of 2D ultrasound images comprises a part of the tool;
generating (120) a 3D ultrasound image based on the plurality of 2D ultrasound images;
identifying (130) a first location of the tool within the 3D ultrasound image; acquiring (140) an additional 2D ultrasound image and location information relating to the location of the ultrasound transducer during capture of the additional 2D ultrasound image;
updating (150) the 3D ultrasound image based on the additional 2D ultrasound image and the location information; and
identifying (160) a location of the tool with respect to the additional 2D ultrasound image within the updated 3D ultrasound image based only on imaging data of the updated 3D ultrasound image.
2. A method (100) as claimed in claim 1, wherein identifying the location of the tool comprises:
identifying a tool shadow within the updated 3D ultrasound image; and identifying the location of the tool based on the tool shadow.
3. A method (100) as claimed in any of claims 1 to 2, wherein the additional 2D ultrasound image is received from a different transducer location to the location for the plurality of 2D ultrasound images and the method further comprises determining a change in location of the ultrasound transducer, wherein the change in location forms at least part of the location information.
4. A method (100) as claimed in claim 3, wherein the determination of a change in location of the ultrasound transducer is performed using one or more of:
block matching;
feature tracking;
motion tracking;
speckle decorrelation;
feature exploitation;
machine learning; and
deep learning.
5. A method (100) as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the location information of the additional 2D ultrasound image comprises translation information relating to the ultrasound transducer.
6. A method (100) as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the location information of the additional 2D ultrasound image comprises orientation information relating to the ultrasound transducer.
7. A method (100) as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, wherein the method further comprises displaying the location of the tool with respect to the additional 2D ultrasound image within the updated 3D ultrasound image to a user.
8. A method (100) as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, wherein the method further comprises displaying the updated 3D ultrasound image to the user.
9. A computer program comprising computer program code means which is adapted, when said computer program is run on a computer, to implement the method of any of claims 1 to 8.
10. An ultrasound imaging system (2) adapted to monitor a location of a tool in an ultrasound image, the system comprising:
an ultrasound probe (4) comprising an ultrasound transducer adapted to obtain a plurality of 2D ultrasound images, wherein at least one of the plurality of 2D ultrasound images comprises a part of the tool; a processor, wherein the processor is adapted to:
generate a 3D ultrasound image based on the plurality of 2D ultrasound images;
identify a first location of the tool within the 3D ultrasound image; update the 3D ultrasound image based on an additional 2D ultrasound image acquired by way of the ultrasound probe and location information relating to the location of the ultrasound transducer during capture of the additional 2D ultrasound image; and
identify a location of the tool with respect to the additional 2D ultrasound image within the updated 3D ultrasound image based only on imaging data of the updated 3D ultrasound image.
11. A system (2) as claimed in claim 10, wherein the processor is further adapted to:
receive the additional 2D ultrasound image from a different transducer location to the location for the plurality of 2D ultrasound images; and
determine a change of location of the ultrasound probe, wherein the change in location forms at least part of the location information.
12. A system (2) as claimed in any of claims 10 to 11, wherein the system further comprises a sensor adapted to acquire the location information.
13. A system (2) as claimed in claim 12, wherein the sensor is an accelerometer or a position sensor.
14. A system (2) as claimed in any of claims 10 to 13, wherein the system further comprises a display (40) adapted to display the location of the tool with respect to the additional 2D ultrasound image within the updated 3D ultrasound image to a user.
15. A system (2) as claimed in claim 14, wherein the display (40) is further adapted to display the updated 3D ultrasound image to the user.
