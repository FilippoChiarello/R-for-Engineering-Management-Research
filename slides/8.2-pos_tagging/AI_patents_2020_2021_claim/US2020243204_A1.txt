MEASUREMENT SOLUTION SERVICE PROVIDING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A computing system is configured to analyze both measurement data and indicator data as big data aggregated in measurement database and indicator database by deep learning for each lot of a part or for each lot of a finished product and a part pre-associated with each other, and also for each consolidation target between bases subordinate to the same start point corresponding to identification information that specifies a business user of the computing system. Analysis target layers by the deep learning are a three-layer serial hierarchical structure containing a production condition layer and an environment condition layer as a start point for analysis of a part layer, or a four-layer serial hierarchical structure containing a part layer, a production condition layer, and an environment condition layer as a start point for analysis of a finished product layer.
