<title>
Energy return orthotic systems
</title>

<abstract>
A plurality of orthotic systems are provided. One bi-layer system is constructed from a single sheet of fabric that is molded into two layers. One tri-layer system includes a base layer; a mid-layer; and an upper layer. The upper layer is joined to the mid-layer and the mid-layer is joined to the base layer. The coupling of the base layer, the mid-layer and the upper layer create a rear spring section, a mid-spring section and a front spring section in which the upper layer is suspended over the mid-layer and the heel portion is suspended on the proximal heel end of the base layer.

<claims>
1. A bi-layer orthotic system comprising: a base layer having a distal toe portion, a mid-portion and a proximal end portion; a single upper layer integrally formed with said base layer, said upper layer having a proximal heel upper layer portion and a bi-furcated distal portion, said bi-furcated distal end of said upper layer integrally coupled at first and second attachment points to the distal toe portion of the base layer, wherein the heel upper layer portion is elevated by a therapeutic angle over said base layer to form a rear spring area and further wherein said distal toe portion of the base layer includes a central area cut into said distal toe portion, said central area having a bifurcated distal portion with first and second central area attachment points integrally formed with said base layer and a proximal portion deformable between an elevated position and a lowered position.
2. The bi-layer orthotic system of claim 1 wherein said bi-furcated distal portion of the heel upper layer portion is integrally formed with the distal toe portion at said attachment points.
3. The bi-layer orthotic system of claim 1 wherein a material used to construct said orthotic system is carbon fiber.
4. The bi-layer orthotic system of claim 1 further comprising a shim positioned between said distal toe portion and said upper layer.
5. The bi-layer orthotic system of claim 1 wherein said orthotic system is configured to be inserted into a footwear of an individual.
6. The bi-layer orthotic system of claim 1 further comprising at least one sensor positioned on or near said orthotic that senses movement and/or pressure during the gait cycle; a knowledge base that provides data on a plurality of foot pathologies and a plurality of information regarding a normal foot and/or normal gait cycle; a processing device in operable communication with said at least one sensor and said knowledge base, said processing device operative to (a) receive data from said at least one sensor related to the gait cycle of an individual; (b) compare said data received from said at least one sensor to the plurality of foot pathologies in said knowledge base; (c) determine a therapeutic correction to the orthotic based on the plurality of information regarding a normal foot and/or normal gait cycle to improve the gait cycle of the individual; and (d) output a visual representation of said correction to the individual.
7. The bi-layer orthotic system of claim 1 wherein said orthotic is configured to be passively; static-dynamically or dynamic-dynamically controlled during the gait cycle to control foot, ankle and body biomechanics.
8. The bi-layer orthotic system of claim 1 wherein the elevation of said heel portion by a therapeutic angle over the base layer is configured to create a central void that off loads pressure on an arch.
9. The bi-layer orthotic system of claim 8 wherein said orthotic includes a flexible fabric or padding structured to suspend a foot over the central void.
10. The bi-layer orthotic system of claim 1 wherein said base layer mid-portion is suspended from a ground and said end portion touches the ground.
11. The bi-layer orthotic system of claim 9 wherein a bi-layer area is structured to provide suspension for a forefoot.
12. The bi-layer orthotic system of claim 1 wherein an edge of said heel upper layer portion is rounded upwardly to accommodate a heel.
