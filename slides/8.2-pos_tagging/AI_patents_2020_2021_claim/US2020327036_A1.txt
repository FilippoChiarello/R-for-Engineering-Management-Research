TOPOLOGY AWARE REAL TIME GPU-TO-GPU TRAFFIC MONITORING METHOD AND ANALYZING TOOLS
</title>

<abstract>
An information handling system may include at least one central processing unit (CPU), and a plurality of special-purpose processing units. The information handling system may be configured to: repeatedly monitor amounts of data traffic exchanged between respective pairs of the special-purpose processing units during selected time periods; based on the monitored amounts of data traffic, determine an amount of traffic imbalance for the plurality of special-purpose processing units; and in response to the amount of traffic imbalance exceeding a threshold amount, transmit a notification indicative of the amount of traffic imbalance.

<claims>
1. An information handling system comprising: at least one central processing unit (CPU); and a plurality of special-purpose processing units; wherein the information handling system is configured to: repeatedly monitor amounts of data traffic exchanged between respective pairs of the special-purpose processing units during selected time periods; based on the monitored amounts of data traffic, determine an amount of traffic imbalance for the plurality of special-purpose processing units; and in response to the amount of traffic imbalance exceeding a threshold amount, transmit a notification indicative of the amount of traffic imbalance.
2. The information handling system of claim 1, wherein the special-purpose processing units are graphics processing units (GPUs).
3. The information handling system of claim 2, wherein the GPUs are configured as general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs).
4. The information handling system of claim 1, wherein the repeatedly monitoring comprises periodically monitoring.
5. The information handling system of claim 1, wherein the monitoring is implemented via a driver program executable on the CPU.
6. The information handling system of claim 1, wherein the information handling system is further configured to: determine a most-utilized one of the plurality of special-purpose processing units.
7. The information handling system of claim 1, wherein the information handling system is further configured to: provide a real-time graphical display indicative of the amounts of data traffic.
8. The information handling system of claim 7, wherein the real-time graphical display is further indicative of a topology of the plurality of special-purpose processing units.
9. The information handling system of claim 1, wherein the at least one CPU is a component of a management controller of the information handling system.
10. A method comprising: repeatedly monitoring amounts of data traffic exchanged between respective pairs of a plurality of special-purpose processing units of an information handling system during selected time periods; based on the monitored amounts of data traffic, determining an amount of traffic imbalance for the plurality of special-purpose processing units; and in response to the amount of traffic imbalance exceeding a threshold amount, transmitting a notification indicative of the amount of traffic imbalance.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the repeatedly monitoring occurs once per second.
12. The method of claim 10, further comprising: determining, based on the monitored amounts of data traffic, respectively utilization levels for each of the plurality of special-purpose processing units.
13. An article of manufacture comprising a non-transitory, computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions thereon that are executable by a processor of an information handling system for: repeatedly monitoring amounts of data traffic exchanged between respective pairs of a plurality of special-purpose processing units of the information handling system during selected time periods; based on the monitored amounts of data traffic, determining an amount of traffic imbalance for the plurality of special-purpose processing units; and in response to the amount of traffic imbalance exceeding a threshold amount, transmitting a notification indicative of the amount of traffic imbalance.
14. The article of claim 13, wherein the special-purpose processing units are graphics processing units (GPUs).
15. The article of claim 13, wherein the processor is a component of a management controller of the information handling system.
16. The article of claim 13, wherein the processor is a component of a host system of the information handling system.
17. The article of claim 13, wherein the monitoring is implemented via a driver program executable on the processor.
18. The article of claim 13, wherein the instructions are further for: determining a most-utilized one of the plurality of special-purpose processing units.
19. The article of claim 13, wherein the instructions are further for: providing a real-time graphical display indicative of the amounts of data traffic.
20. The article of claim 19, wherein the real-time graphical display is further indicative of a topology of the plurality of special-purpose processing units.
