<title>
REAL-TIME IN-CONTEXT SMART SUMMARIZER
</title>

<abstract>
A summarizer can be invoked by a user to summarize content. Once started, the summarizer can examine the content, determine a main body of the content, extract texts from the main body, concatenate the texts into a text block, and make a call to an artificial intelligence (AI) platform. The call can contain the text block and specify a user-configurable summarization range for summarizing the text block. The AI platform is operable to generate a sentiment of the text block and a summary of the text block in the summarization range and return them to the summarizer. The summarizer, in turn, can instruct an application on the user device to generate a window or page for displaying the sentiment and the summary in the summarization range on the user device, in real time and in context of the content that the user is viewing, reading, or listening.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: receiving, by a summarizer on a user device, an instruction from a user to summarize content displayed on the user device; examining, by the summarizer, the content displayed on the user device; determining, by the summarizer, a main body of the content; extracting, by the summarizer, texts from the main body of the content; concatenating, by the summarizer, the texts from the main body of the content into a text block; making, by the summarizer, a call to an artificial intelligence (AI) platform, the call containing the text block and specifying a summarization range for summarizing the text block, a summarization component of the AI platform for generating a summary of the text block in the summarization range, and a sentiment analyzer component of the AI platform for generating a sentiment of the text block, wherein the AI platform returns, to the summarizer on the user device, the sentiment and the summary in the summarization range; and instructing, by the summarizer, an application on the user device to generate a window or page for displaying the sentiment and the summary in the summarization range on the user device.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the application comprises a browser application, wherein the instruction is received from the user through the browser application, wherein the content comprises a web page, wherein the main body comprises an article within the web page, wherein the window or page generated by the browser application comprises a popup, and wherein the sentiment and the summary in the summarization range are displayed in the popup on the user device in real time in context of the article within the web page.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein the summarizer runs in an environment provided by the browser application on the user device.
4. The method according to claim 2, wherein the summarizer is implemented as an extension of the browser application on the user device.
5. The method according to claim 2, wherein examining the content further comprises examining a source code of the web page and identifying text nodes in the source code corresponding to the main body, and wherein extracting texts from the content further comprises parsing the text nodes and extracting the texts from the text nodes.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein identifying text nodes in the source code further comprises identifying HyperText Markup Language (HTML) tags, the HTML tags including at least a <p> tag, a <plaintext> tag, or a <div> tag.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein the user device comprises a mobile device, a smart phone, a laptop computer, or a desktop computer.
8. The method according to claim 1, wherein the summarizer operates on the user device as an agent of the AI platform and independently of the application.
9. The method according to claim 1, wherein the content comprises a document having a portal document format (PDF) extension or a doc extension.
10. The method according to claim 1, wherein the summarization range comprises a number, category, percentage, or size of sentence.
11. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: storing the sentiment or the summary on the user device; or forwarding the sentiment or the summary to another device over a network.
12. A system, comprising: a processor; a non-transitory computer-readable medium; and stored instructions translatable by the processor to perform: receiving an instruction from a user to summarize content displayed on a user device; examining the content displayed on the user device; determining a main body of the content; extracting texts from the main body of the content; concatenating the texts from the main body of the content into a text block; making a call to an artificial intelligence (AI) platform, the call containing the text block and specifying a summarization range for summarizing the text block, a summarization component of the AI platform for generating a summary of the text block in the summarization range, and a sentiment analyzer component of the AI platform for generating a sentiment of the text block, wherein the AI platform returns, to the summarizer on the user device, the sentiment and the summary in the summarization range; and instructing an application on the user device to generate a window or page for displaying the sentiment and the summary in the summarization range on the user device.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the application comprises a browser application, wherein the instruction is received from the user through the browser application, wherein the content comprises a web page, wherein the main body comprises an article within the web page, wherein the window or page generated by the browser application comprises a popup, and wherein the sentiment and the summary in the summarization range are displayed in the popup on the user device in real time in context of the article within the web page.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein examining the content further comprises examining a source code of the web page and identifying text nodes in the source code corresponding to the main body, and wherein extracting texts from the content further comprises parsing the text nodes and extracting the texts from the text nodes.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein identifying text nodes in the source code further comprises identifying HyperText Markup Language (HTML) tags, the HTML tags including at least a <p> tag, a <plaintext> tag, or a <div> tag.
16. The system of claim 12, wherein the user device comprises a mobile device, a smart phone, a laptop computer, or a desktop computer.
17. The system of claim 12, wherein the content comprises a document having a portal document format (PDF) extension or a doc extension.
18. The system of claim 12, wherein the summarization range comprises a number, category, percentage, or size of sentence.
19. The system of claim 12, wherein the instructions are further translatable by the processor to perform: storing the sentiment or the summary on the user device.
20. The system of claim 12, wherein the instructions are further translatable by the processor to perform: forwarding the sentiment or the summary to another device over a network.
