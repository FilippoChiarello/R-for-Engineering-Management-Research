<title>
MOVEMENT PREDICTION OF PEDESTRIANS USEFUL FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING
</title>

<abstract>
A prediction device is described for predicting a location of a pedestrian moving in an environment. The prediction device may have a memory configured to store a probability distribution for multiple latent variables indicating one or more states of the one or more pedestrians. The prediction device may be configured to predict a position of a pedestrian for which no position information is currently available from the probability distribution of the multiple latent variables.
