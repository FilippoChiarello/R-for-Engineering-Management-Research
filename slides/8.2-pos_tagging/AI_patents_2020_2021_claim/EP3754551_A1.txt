ITEM COMPARISON SYSTEM, DEVICE AND METHOD THEREFOR
</title>

<abstract>
A system for training a machine learning model (106) is disclosed. The system comprises processing means configured to receive data defining one or more characteristics associated with a first item. The system receives a plurality of images of the first item wherein the plurality of images are associated with a plurality of different image sources. The system trains the machine learning model using the plurality of images and the one or more characteristics.

<claims>
1. A system for training a machine learning model (106), the system comprising: a. processing means configured to: i. receive data defining one or more characteristics associated with a first item; ii. receive a plurality of images of the first item wherein the plurality of images are associated with a plurality of different image sources; and iii. train the machine learning model using the plurality of images and one or more characteristics.
2. The system of claim 1 wherein the plurality of different image sources comprise any one or more of an image capture means communicatively coupled to the processing means and a database comprising one or more representations of the first item.
3. The system of any preceding claim wherein the received data defines the characteristics as any one or more of shape, colour, configuration, text, a logo, texture, pattern, surface decoration, ornamentation, a spatial relationship between features of the item, or a combination of features of the item.
4. The system of any preceding claim further comprising an image processing module (108), wherein the image processing module (108) is further configured to perform a rotation of each image by a predetermined value to generate a transformed image or images, wherein the predetermined value is preferably selected based on the type of item.
5. The system of any preceding claim wherein the or an image processing module is further configured to perform an image transformation to reverse pixels associated with each image along a first axis to generate the or a transformed image or images.
6. The system of claims 4 or 5 wherein the machine learning model (106) is trained using the plurality of images and the transformed image or images.
7. The system of any preceding claim further comprising a rotatable platform for supporting the item and wherein the or an image capture means is configured to capture the plurality of images of the item.
8. The system of claim 7 further comprising a drive means for rotating the platform by a predetermined value and capturing images of the item with the image capture means to generate the plurality of images of the article.
9. The system of any preceding claim wherein the processing means is further configured to determine an image background and whether the image background is blank.
10. The system of claim 9 wherein the processing means is configured to apply a first predetermined image rotation when the image has a blank background and a second image rotation when the image has a non-uniform background wherein the size of the first image rotation is different from the size of the second image rotation.
11. An image comparison system for determining the degree of similarity of an image of an item and a further image of a further item, the system comprising a machine learning model (106) trained using the system of any preceding claim wherein the processing means is configured to: i. receive the further image of a further item; ii. determine, using the machine learning model (106), one or more predetermined item characteristics associated with the further image or further item, and a probability associated with each item characteristic associated with the further item wherein each probability is indicative of the likelihood that the item has the characteristic or characteristics defining each item type; and iii. determine a degree of similarity of the images or items image based on the probability associated with each item characteristic.
12. The image comparison system of claims 12 wherein the processing means is further configured to output the image of the item to a display and an associated probability of the degree of similarity between the image and the further image.
13. The image comparison system of claims 12 or 13 further comprising determining the degree of similarly to a plurality of different products.
14. The image comparison system of any one of claims 12 to 14 further comprising a search interface to generate a search string generation set wherein the search string generation set comprises a plurality or set of keywords and or entities.
15. The system of any preceding claim further comprising a search module (101) wherein the search module is configured to generate search strings by using a keyword analysis of web pages or source material.
16. A method for executing the system of any preceding claim.
17. A computer program product which when executed undertakes the method of claim 16.
