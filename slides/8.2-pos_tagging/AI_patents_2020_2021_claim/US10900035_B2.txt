PRNA three-way junctions
</title>

<abstract>
Three-way junction (3WJ) RNA scaffolds derived from phi29, M2, SF5, and GA1 pRNAs and which have high stability are described. The pRNA 3WJ scaffolds can be used to form compounds, conjugates, compositions, and nanoparticles for delivery of active agents for therapeutic and/or diagnostic functions.

<claims>
1. An RNA junction scaffold, comprising: a three-way junction (3WJ) domain, the 3WJ domain comprising a 3WJa sequence comprising a first RNA polynucleotide, a 3WJb sequence comprising a second RNA polynucleotide, and a 3WJc sequence comprising a third RNA polynucleotide, wherein a first branch of the 3WJ domain is formed from a 5′ portion of the 3WJa sequence and a 3′ portion of the 3WJc sequence and comprises a first helical region, a second branch of the 3WJ domain is formed from a 3′ portion of the 3WJa sequence and a 5′ portion of the 3WJb sequence and comprises a second helical region, and a third branch of the 3WJ domain is formed from a 3′ portion of the 3WJb sequence and a 5′ portion of the 3WJc sequence and comprises a third helical region, wherein each of said helical regions comprises a plurality of RNA nucleotide pairs that form canonical Watson-Crick bonds, and wherein (i) the 3WJa sequence is absent an unpaired nucleotide positioned between the first helical region and the second helical region, and two unpaired nucleotides are positioned in the 3WJa sequence in the second branch, and (ii) two adjacent unpaired nucleotides are positioned in the 3WJc sequence between the first helical region and the third helical region, and one unpaired nucleotide is positioned in the 3WJb sequence between the second helical region and the third helical region.
2. The RNA junction scaffold of claim 1, wherein the 3WJa sequence comprises SEQ ID NO:73, the 3WJb sequence comprises SEQ ID NO:74, and the 3WJc sequence comprises SEQ ID NO:75.
3. The RNA junction scaffold of claim 1, wherein the second branch is absent adjacent unpaired nucleotides in positions corresponding to unpaired adenine and uracil nucleotides in positions 36 and 37, respectively, of a wild type M2 pRNA, and wherein the third branch is absent an unpaired nucleotide in a position corresponding to an unpaired adenine nucleotide in position 79 of said wild type M2 pRNA.
4. The RNA junction scaffold of claim 1, absent one or more unpaired nucleotides in the 3WJa sequence downstream of the two unpaired nucleotides present in the 3WJa sequence.
5. The RNA junction scaffold of claim 1, absent an unpaired nucleotide in the 3WJb sequence downstream of the unpaired nucleotide present in the 3WJb sequence.
6. The RNA junction scaffold of claim 1, absent one or more unpaired nucleotides in the 3WJa sequence downstream of the two unpaired nucleotides present in the 3WJa sequence, and absent an unpaired nucleotide in the 3WJb sequence downstream of the unpaired nucleotide present in the 3WJb sequence.
7. A conjugate comprising the RNA 3WJ scaffold of claim 1, linked to at least one moiety selected from the group consisting of therapeutic drugs, antibodies, markers, dyes, siRNAs, ribozymes, riboswitches, and aptamers.
8. A composition, comprising the conjugate of claim 7, and a pharmaceutically-acceptable vehicle, carrier, or diluent.
9. An RNA junction scaffold, comprising: a three-way junction (3WJ) domain, the 3WJ domain comprising a 3WJa sequence comprising a first RNA polynucleotide, a 3WJb sequence comprising a second RNA polynucleotide, and a 3WJc sequence comprising a third RNA polynucleotide, wherein a first branch of the 3WJ domain is formed from a 5′ portion of the 3WJa sequence and a 3′ portion of the 3WJc sequence and comprises a first helical region, a second branch of the 3WJ domain is formed from a 3′ portion of the 3WJa sequence and a 5′ portion of the 3WJb sequence and comprises a second helical region, and a third branch of the 3WJ domain is formed from a 3′ portion of the 3WJb sequence and a 5′ portion of the 3WJc sequence and comprises a third helical region, wherein each of said helical regions comprises a plurality of RNA nucleotide pairs that form canonical Watson-Crick bonds, and wherein (i) the 3WJa sequence comprises zero or one unpaired nucleotide positioned between the first helical region and the second helical region, and/or one or two unpaired nucleotides in the second branch, and (ii) the 3WJc sequence comprises one unpaired or two adjacent unpaired nucleotides between the first helical region and the third helical region, and/or the 3WJb sequence comprises up to two unpaired nucleotides selected from the group consisting of one unpaired nucleotide and two adjacent unpaired nucleotides, wherein the up to two unpaired nucleotides are positioned in the 3WJb sequence between the second helical region and the third helical region.
10. A conjugate comprising the RNA 3WJ scaffold of claim 9, linked to at least one moiety selected from the group consisting of therapeutic drugs, antibodies, markers, dyes, siRNAs, ribozymes, riboswitches, and aptamers.
11. A composition, comprising the conjugate of claim 9, and a pharmaceutically-acceptable vehicle, carrier, or diluent.
12. The RNA junction scaffold of claim 9, wherein each of the 3WJa, 3WJb, and 3WJc sequences comprises, independently, from 8 to 36 nucleotides, not including an RNA linker or an RNA portion of a biologically-active moiety conjugated to the RNA scaffold.
