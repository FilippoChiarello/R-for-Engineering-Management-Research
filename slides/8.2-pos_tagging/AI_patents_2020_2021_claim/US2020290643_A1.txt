VEHICLE CONTROL DEVICE, VEHICLE CONTROL METHOD, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle control device includes a road width recognizer configured to recognize a width of a road on which a vehicle travels, a pedestrian recognizer configure to recognize pedestrians present in a vicinity of the vehicle, and a driving controller configured to cause the vehicle to travel by controlling one or both of steering and acceleration of the vehicle independently from an operation of an occupant of the vehicle, and to cause the vehicle to travel behind a pedestrian who has substantially the same proceeding direction as the vehicle and has a high priority level among the pedestrians recognized by the pedestrian recognizer when a width of the road recognized by the road width recognizer is equal to or less than a predetermined width.

<claims>
What is claim is:
1. 1.-11. (canceled)
12. A vehicle control device comprising: a road width recognizer configured to recognize a width of a road on which a vehicle travels; a pedestrian recognizer configured to recognize pedestrians present in a vicinity of the vehicle; and a driving controller configured to cause the vehicle to travel by controlling one or both of steering and acceleration of the vehicle independently from an operation of an occupant of the vehicle, and to cause the vehicle to travel behind a pedestrian who has substantially the same proceeding direction as the vehicle among the pedestrians recognized by the pedestrian recognizer when a width of the road recognized by the road width recognizer is equal to or less than a predetermined width.
13. The vehicle control device according to claim 12, wherein, when the width of the road recognized by the road width recognizer is equal to or less than a predetermined width, the driving controller causes the vehicle to follow a pedestrian who has substantially the same proceeding direction as the vehicle and has a high priority level among the pedestrians recognized by the pedestrian recognizer.
14. The vehicle control device according to claim 13, wherein, when it is not possible to overtake the pedestrian who has substantially the same proceeding direction as the vehicle and has a high priority level among the pedestrians recognized by the pedestrian recognizer, the driving controller causes the vehicle to travel behind the pedestrian.
15. The vehicle control device according to claim 13, wherein the pedestrian having a high priority level is a pedestrian closest to the vehicle.
16. The vehicle control device according to claim 12, wherein the pedestrian recognizer recognizes that the pedestrian has turned around after the driving controller has started control to cause the vehicle to travel behind the pedestrian, and the driving controller executes driving control to overtake the pedestrian when the pedestrian recognizer recognizes that the pedestrian has turned around.
17. The vehicle control device according to claim 12, wherein the pedestrian recognizer recognizes a position of the pedestrian in a width direction of a road on which the vehicle travels, and the driving controller, when a pedestrian recognized by the pedestrian recognizer moves closer to one side of the road in the width direction by a predetermined degree or more, executes driving control to overtake the pedestrian from the other side.
18. The vehicle control device according to claim 17, wherein, when there is an area in which the pedestrian has difficulty walking on a road on which the vehicle travels, the driving controller causes the vehicle to pass through the area under driving control to overtake the pedestrian.
19. The vehicle control device according to claim 18, wherein, when the pedestrian recognizer recognizes that the pedestrian has turned around, the driving controller execute driving control to overtake the pedestrian by making an extra width secured for overtaking the pedestrian smaller than an extra width when the pedestrian does not turn around.
20. The vehicle control device according to claim 12, further comprising: a projector configured to project an image onto a road on which the vehicle travels; and a projection controller configured to cause, when the pedestrian recognizer recognizes a pedestrian, an image prompting the pedestrian to avoid onto the road on which the vehicle travels.
21. The vehicle control device according to claim 20, wherein, when the pedestrian recognizer recognizes the pedestrian has avoided after the projector has projected an image prompting the pedestrian to avoid, the driving controller executes driving control to overtake the pedestrian.
22. A vehicle control method comprising: recognizing, by a road width recognizer, a width of a road on which a vehicle travels; recognizing, by a pedestrian recognizer, pedestrians present in a vicinity of the vehicle; and causing, by a driving controller, the vehicle to travel by controlling one or both of steering and acceleration of the vehicle independently from an operation of an occupant of the vehicle, and, when the width of the road recognized by the road width recognizer is equal to or less than a predetermined width, causing the vehicle to travel behind a pedestrian who has substantially the same proceeding direction as the vehicle among the pedestrians recognized by the pedestrian recognizer.
23. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium that stores a program to be executed by a vehicle computer to perform at least: recognize a width of a road on which the vehicle travels; recognize pedestrians present in a vicinity of the vehicle; cause the vehicle to travel by controlling one or both of steering and acceleration of the vehicle independently from an operation of an occupant of the vehicle; and cause the vehicle to travel behind a pedestrian who has substantially the same proceeding direction as the vehicle among the recognized pedestrians when the recognized width of the road is equal to or less than a predetermined width.
