A SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ANALYSIS OF SMART METER DATA
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention discloses a method for improving energy management, enabling reduced energy consumption and load shedding based on analysis of smart electricity meter data. The method discloses an intelligent system, wherein it precisely estimates residential electricity demand by using dynamically generated smart meter data using incremental clustering algorithm. The disclosed invention redesigns and develops a parameter-free incremental clustering algorithm for mining the hidden patterns of electricity load shedding such as season-wise, time (day/night) specific patterns.

WE CLAIM:
1. A method for analysing smart meter data to optimize electricity load management, the method comprising:
receiving raw dataset from each smart meter of a set of smart meters (103);
dynamically generating a set of clusters from the raw dataset by:
pre-processing raw dataset to generate normalized data;
generating a set of basic cluster(s) by processing the normalized data;
incrementally clustering new data, received from the set of smart meters (103), by selectively updating the set of basic cluster(s) or adding new cluster(s) to the set of basic cluster(s) based on the influx of the new data; and analysing each cluster from the set of clusters for determining load shedding patterns during planned and unplanned electricity outages to optimize the electricity load management.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the raw dataset includes at least one parameter selected from active power, reactive power, a voltage, a current, and a power factor.
3. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein pre-processing includes data normalization, cleaning of data, and noise removal by utilizing statistical techniques.
4. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the incremental clustering algorithm operates in a semisupervised mode for accommodating new incoming data in real time, wherein semisupervised mode performs selective update of the formed clusters by appending the existing clusters or forming new clusters by using the combination of labelled and unlabelled data.
5. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the electricity consumption by individual household is determined by capturing and generating the hidden patterns of electricity consumption during day-time, night-time, and season.
6. A system (101) for analysing smart meter data to optimize electricity load management, the system (101) comprising:
a memory (203); and
a processor (201), wherein the processor (201) is configured to execute programmed instructions stored in the memory (203) for:
receiving raw dataset from each smart meter of a set of smart meters (103); dynamically generating a set of clusters from the raw dataset by:
pre-processing raw dataset to generate normalized data;
generating a set of basic cluster(s) by processing the normalized data; incrementally clustering new data, received from the set of smart meters, by selectively updating the set of basic cluster(s) or adding new cluster(s) to the set of basic cluster(s) based on the influx of the new data; and
analysing each cluster from the set of clusters for determining load shedding patterns during planned and unplanned electricity outages to optimize the electricity load management.
7. The system (101) as claimed in claim 6, wherein the raw dataset includes at least one parameter selected from active power, reactive power, a voltage, a current, and a power factor.
8. The system (101) as claimed in claim 6, wherein pre-processing includes data normalization, cleaning of data, and noise removal by utilizing statistical techniques.
9. The system (101) as claimed in claim 6, wherein the incremental clustering algorithm operates in a semisupervised mode for accommodating new incoming data in a real time, wherein semisupervised mode performs selective update of the formed clusters by appending the existing clusters or forming new clusters by using the combination of labelled and unlabelled data.
10. The system (101) as claimed in claim 6, wherein the electricity consumption by individual household is determined by capturing and generating the hidden patterns of electricity consumption during day-time, night-time, and season.
