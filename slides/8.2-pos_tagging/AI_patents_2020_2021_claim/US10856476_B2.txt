<claims>
1. An agricultural irrigation control system, comprising: a pump; a dual port and on/off diverter in fluid communication with the pump; a multi-port diverter in fluid communication with the dual port and on/off diverter; a controller board in electronic communication with the dual port and on/off diverter and the multi-port diverter, the controller board controlling the operation of the dual port and on/off diverter and the multi-port diverter; and a plurality of environmental sensors in electronic communication with the controller board; wherein the agricultural irrigation control system is configured for individualized administration of one or more substances to one or more agricultural products based on real-time analysis of the one or more agricultural products and/or a surrounding environment of the one or more agricultural products provided by one or more environmental sensors of the plurality of environmental sensors.
2. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 1, wherein the dual port and on/off diverter is a servo motor-driven diverter.
3. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 1, wherein the multi-port diverter is a servo motor-driven diverter.
4. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 1, wherein the dual port and on/off diverter is liquid-reversible and wherein the multi-port diverter is liquidreversible.
5. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 1, wherein the dual port and on/off diverter has a rack-and-pinion mechanism.
6. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 1, wherein the multi-port diverter has 2 ports, 4 ports, 10 ports, or 12 ports.
7. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 1, wherein the multi-port diverter has a rotary arrangement.
8. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of environmental sensors includes one or more soil humidity level sensors.
9. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of environmental sensors includes one or more of an ambient temperature and humidity sensor, an electrical conductivity sensor, a pH level sensor, a carbon dioxide level sensor, and an infrared canopy temperature sensor.
10. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 1, further comprising a plurality of tanks in fluid communication with the multi-port diverter.
11. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 10, wherein each tank in the plurality of tanks includes a different solution.
12. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 10, wherein each tank in the plurality of tanks includes an identical solution.
13. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 10, wherein the plurality of environmental sensors includes one or more of a tank level sensor, a tank solution temperature sensor, a tank solution pH level sensor, and a tank solution electrical conductivity sensor.
14. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 1, further comprising a liquid analysis unit configured to analyze a slurry generated as a result of delivering water to the one or more agricultural products by the agricultural irrigation control system.
15. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 1, further comprising a quick disconnect coupler.
16. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 1, wherein the controller board is configured to communicate with one or more additional agricultural irrigation control systems through an Internet of Things (IoT) communication mechanism.
17. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 1, wherein the controller board includes a relay configured to directly or indirectly control the pump.
18. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 1, wherein the controller board utilizes machine learning to control the administration of the one or more substances to the one or more agricultural products based on the real-time analysis provided by the one or more environmental sensors.
19. The agricultural irrigation control system of claim 1, wherein the one or more substances are one or more of water, agricultural feed, minerals, nutrients, and agricultural chemicals.
