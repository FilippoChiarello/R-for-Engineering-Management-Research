MACHINE LEARNING DEVICE, PREDICTION DEVICE, AND CONTROLLER
</title>

<abstract>
The state of a cutting fluid after machining is predicted. A machine learning device includes: an input data acquisition unit that acquires input data including arbitrary machining conditions for an arbitrary work in machining by an arbitrary machine tool and state information indicating a state of a cutting fluid before machining is performed under the machining conditions; a label acquisition unit that acquires label data indicating state information of the cutting fluid after the machining is performed under the machining conditions included in the input data; and a learning unit that executes supervised learning using the input data acquired by the input data acquisition unit and the label data acquired by the label acquisition unit to generate a learned model.
