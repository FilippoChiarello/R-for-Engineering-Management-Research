System and method for controlling the printing of documents, and performing analytics regarding documents printed, in a distributed enterprise environment
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of a print analysis system are disclosed herein. Embodiments of these print analysis systems may include a print analyzer deployed on one or more printers within an enterprise environment and executing on the printers themselves. The print analyzer on the printer may then apply one or more print analysis rules to a document. Additionally, or alternatively, the print analyzer may send the document to a content management system for storage in a workspace or other storage area corresponding to printed documents of the enterprise. The documents in the workspace on the content management system may be evaluated or analyzed to provide understanding or insight into the documents printed in the enterprise environment.
