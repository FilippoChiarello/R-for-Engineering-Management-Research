OPTICAL FIBER CHARACTERISTIC MEASUREMENT DEVICE AND OPTICAL FIBER CHARACTERISTIC MEASUREMENT METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An optical fiber characteristic measurement device includes: a detector that detects Brillouin scattered light obtained by causing light to be incident on an optical fiber under test; a spectrum analyzer that obtains a Brillouin gain spectrum from the Brillouin scattered light; and a spectrum analyzing controller that: measures a characteristic of the optical fiber under test by analyzing the Brillouin gain spectrum to obtain a peak frequency of the Brillouin gain spectrum, and changes a frequency range used by the spectrum analyzer to obtain the Brillouin gain spectrum according to the peak frequency.
