IMPLEMENTING EVENT RULES FOR MAINTENANCE RELEVANT EVENTS IN A MULTITUDE OF MACHINES
</title>

<abstract>
Method for implementing event rules for maintenance relevant events in a multitude of machines, whereas the method uses a computer system containing a common central configurator (CCC), whereas in order to transfer data the machines are connected to the common central configurator, the method comprising the steps of- defining a maintenance relevant event for a certain class of machines by using the common central configurator (CCC),- sending the event rule to an edge device (E1,E2) of at least one machine of this class, preferably to the edge devices (E1,E2) of all machines of this class, whereas the edge device (E1,E2) is part of the computer system, and storing the event rule in the edge device (E1,E2),- storing the event rule in the common central configurator (CCC). Thus it is possible to implement event rules in a multitude of similar machines without having to implement those event rules on every single machine independently.

<claims>
1. Method for implementing event rules for maintenance relevant events in a multitude of machines, whereas the method uses a computer system containing a common central configurator (CCC), whereas in order to transfer data the machines are connected to the common central configurator, the method comprising the steps of - defining a maintenance relevant event for a certain class of machines by using the common central configurator (CCC), - sending the event rule to an edge device (E1,E2) of at least one machine of this class, preferably to the edge devices of all machines of this class, whereas the edge device (E1,E2) is part of the computer system, and storing the event rule in the edge device (E1,E2), - storing the event rule in the common central configurator (CCC).
2. Method according to claim 1, wherein the edge device (E1,E2) is situated at or near the machine whereas the common central configurator (CCC) is realized as a cloud service.
3. Method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the edge device (E1,E2) includes a complex event processing engine (CEP_E) which, on the basis of the event rule and on the basis of input data from the machine, creates an event message if the input data fulfills the event rule and sends the event message to a device which deploys a respective maintenance rule.
4. Method according to claim 3, wherein the edge device (E1,E2) includes a message broker (MB) which receives signals from sensors (S1,S2) of the machine and processes the signals before sending them as input data to the complex event processing engine (CEP_E).
5. Method according to any of claims 1 to 4 wherein the common central configurator (CCC) includes a knowledge base (KB) which stores a model of each machine, its data sources, its events and corresponding event rules, whereas new events are stored as new data sources.
6. Method according to any of claims 1 to 5 wherein the common central configurator (CCC) includes a user interface (UI) for defining an event for a certain class of machines, by using semantic models.
7. Method according to claim 5, wherein the common central configurator (CCC) includes a deployment module (DM) which deploys a new event rule for an edge device (E1,E2) of at least one machine of this class, preferably for the edge devices (E1,E2) of all machines of this class, and which after that updates the model in the knowledge base (KB) with the new event rule.
8. Method according to claim 5 wherein if a machine is reconfigured the event rule is automatically updated by amending the model of that machine in the knowledge base (KB) and by deployment of the new event rule to the respective machines.
9. Computer program code means adapted to perform all the steps of any one of the preceding claims when the computer program is run on a computer system containing a common central configurator (CCC) and a multitude of edge devices (E1,E2).
10. Computer system, for performing the method according to any of claims 1 to 8, comprising - a multitude of machines with edge devices (E1,E2), - a common central configurator (CCC),
whereas in order to transfer data the machines are connected to the common central configurator (CCC) via edge devices (E1,E2), - whereas the common central configurator (CCC) is designed to allow for defining a maintenance relevant event for a certain class of machines, - whereas the common central configurator (CCC) is designed to send the respective event rule to an edge device (E1,E2) of at least one machine (M1,M2) of this class, preferably to the edge devices (E1,E2) of all machines of this class, whereas the edge device (E1,E2) is part of the computer system, and to store the event rule, - whereas the edge devices (E1,E2) are designed to store the event rule.
