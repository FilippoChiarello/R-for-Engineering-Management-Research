<title>
Collecting and correlating microphone data from multiple co-located clients, and constructing 3D sound profile of a room
</title>

<abstract>
An overlay network platform facilitates a multi-party conference. End users participate in the conference using client-based web browser software, and using a protocol such as WebRTC. According to this disclosure, an enhanced "audio" experience for the conference is providing by collecting and correlating microphone data from multiple co-located clients, and then constructing (at the platform) a three-dimensional (3D) sound profile of the room in which the clients are co-located. By processing in the platform (as opposed to locally at each client), the approach enables platform-side creation of an ad-hoc, high quality microphone array that identifies the relative positions and orientations of the microphones that are being used by the clients. Individual audio streams received from the microphones are combined, and the relative position information (of the individual microphones) is used to render a single audio stream that represents a high quality recording of the audio in the common physical space. Other clients in the conference request, receive and play back this high quality stream to obtain a high-fidelity 3D representation of the audio as if they are physically present in the room.

<claims>
1. Apparatus associated with an overlay network, comprising: a hardware processor; and computer memory holding computer program instructions executed by the hardware processor, the computer program instructions comprising program code executed to carry out operations, the operations comprising: given a set of audio streams that comprise a conference, identifying a set of clients in the conference that are co-located with one another using one of: passive correlation, and active correlation; for the identified set of clients, identifying at least one event that is found in each of the audio streams; with respect to the at least one event, comparing a relative characteristic associated with the event, and using the relative characteristic to infer a relative physical position of each client in the set of clients; combining individual audio streams received from the clients and using the relative physical position to render a single audio stream; and in lieu of delivering individual ones of the audio streams, delivering the single audio stream via the overlay network.
2. The apparatus as described in claim 1 wherein the operations further comprise mixing an audio stream corresponding to a person currently speaking with the single audio stream to enhance audibility of the person currently speaking.
3. The apparatus as described in claim 1 wherein the single audio stream is delivered using an HTML5 Web Audio Application Programming Interface (API).
4. The apparatus as described in claim 1 wherein the single audio stream is a stereo or multichannel surround audio stream.
5. The apparatus as described in claim 4 wherein a single stereo or multichannel surround audio stream is delivered for rendering in a web browser.
6. The apparatus as described in claim 1 wherein the set of clients are identified using one of: client IP addresses, and a client physical location.
7. The apparatus as described in claim 6 wherein the client physical location is determined using an HTML5 geolocation API and received via a RESTful HTTP request.
8. The apparatus as described in claim 1 wherein the overlay network is a content delivery network (CDN).
