VEHICLE LAMP SYSTEM, VEHICLE LAMP CONTROL DEVICE, AND VEHICLE LAMP CONTROL METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
This vehicle lamp system (1) comprises: an imaging unit (12) that captures an image of an area forward of a vehicle; a brightness analysis unit (14) that detects the brightness of each of a plurality of individual areas ranged forward of the vehicle on the basis of the information obtained from the imaging unit (12); a light intensity setting unit (42) that defines the intensities of light to project onto each individual area on the basis of the detection result of the brightness analysis unit (14); a light source unit (10) capable of independently adjusting the intensity of light to project onto each of the plurality of individual areas; and a light source control unit (20) that controls the light source unit (10) on the basis of the light intensity defined by the light intensity setting unit (42). The light intensity setting unit (42) detects a high-brightness area and a low-brightness area adjacent to each other on the basis of the detection result of the brightness analysis unit (14), and accentuates the boundary between the high-brightness area and the low-brightness area by setting the light intensity so as to increase the difference in brightness between the edge on the high-brightness side and the edge on the low-brightness side along the boundary.

<claims>
1. A vehicle lamp system comprising: an imaging unit that images a scene in front of a driver's vehicle; a brightness analyzer that detects a brightness of each of a plurality of individual areas arranged in front of the driver's vehicle, based on information obtained from the imaging unit; an illuminance setting unit that defines an illuminance value of light to illuminate each individual area, based on a detection result of the brightness analyzer; a light source unit capable of adjusting an illuminance of light to illuminate each of the plurality of individual areas independently; and a light source controller that controls the light source unit based on the illuminance value defined by the illuminance setting unit, wherein the illuminance setting unit detects a high-brightness area and a low-brightness area adjacent to each other based on the detection result of the brightness analyzer and sets the illuminance value to increase a brightness difference between a high-brightness edge portion and a low-brightness edge portion along a boundary between the high-brightness area and the low-brightness area, thereby enhancing the boundary.
2. The vehicle lamp system according to claim 1,
wherein
the illuminance setting unit sets the illuminance value so that a brightness of the high-brightness edge portion is higher than a brightness of a high-brightness inward area in the high-brightness area more distanced from the boundary than the high-brightness edge portion.
3. The vehicle lamp system according to claim 1,
wherein
the illuminance setting unit sets the illuminance value so that a brightness of the low-brightness edge portion is lower than a brightness of a low-brightness inward area in the low-brightness area more distanced from the boundary than the low-brightness edge portion.
4. The vehicle lamp system according to claim 1,
wherein
the illuminance setting unit sets the illuminance value so that a brightness of the high-brightness edge portion is higher than a brightness of a high-brightness inward area in the high-brightness area more distanced from the boundary than the high-brightness edge portion and that a brightness of the low-brightness edge portion is lower than a brightness of a low-brightness inward area in the low-brightness area more distanced from the boundary than the low-brightness edge portion.
5. A controller for a vehicle lamp, comprising: a brightness analyzer that detects a brightness of each of a plurality of individual areas arranged in front of a driver's vehicle; an illuminance setting unit that defines an illuminance value of light to illuminate each individual area, based on a detection result of the brightness analyzer; and a light source controller that controls a light source unit capable of adjusting an illuminance of light to illuminate each individual area independently, based on the illuminance value defined by the illuminance setting unit, wherein the illuminance setting unit detects a high-brightness area and a low-brightness area adjacent to each other, based on a detection result of the brightness analyzer, and sets the illuminance value to increase a brightness difference between a high-brightness edge portion and a low-brightness edge portion along a boundary between the high-brightness area and the low-brightness area, thereby enhancing the boundary.
6. A method of controlling a vehicle lamp, comprising
detecting a brightness of each of a plurality of individual areas arranged in front of a driver's vehicle;
defining an illuminance value of light to illuminate each individual area, based on the brightness detected; and
illuminating each individual area with light based on the illuminance value defined, wherein
in the defining of the illuminance value, a high-brightness area and a low-brightness area adjacent to each other are detected based on a result of detecting the brightness, and the illuminance value is set to increase a brightness difference between a high-brightness edge portion and a low-brightness edge portion along a boundary between the high-brightness area and the low-brightness area, thereby enhancing the boundary.
