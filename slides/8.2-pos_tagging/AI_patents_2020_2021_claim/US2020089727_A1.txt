CALCULATING DEVICE, CALCULATION PROGRAM, RECORDING MEDIUM, AND CALCULATION METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
According to one embodiment, a calculating device includes a processor. The processor acquires a data set {s} and repeats a processing procedure. The processing procedure includes first and second variable updates. The first variable update includes updating an ith entry of a first variable xi by adding a first function to the ith entry of the first variable xi. The ith entry of the first variable xi is one of a first variable set {x}. A variable of the first function includes at least a part of a second variable set {y}. The second variable update includes updating an ith entry of a second variable yi by adding a second function and a third function to the ith entry of the second variable yi. The ith entry of the second variable yi is one of the second variable set {y}. The processor outputs at least a fourth function.
