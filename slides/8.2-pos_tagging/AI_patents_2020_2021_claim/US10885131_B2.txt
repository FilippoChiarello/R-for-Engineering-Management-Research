System and method for temporal identification of latent user communities using electronic content
</title>

<abstract>
Various embodiments are described herein for a system and method for determining a community of users with similar temporal behaviour from a plurality of users that generate electronic content during a time period by, for example, accessing the electronic content from a data store using a processing unit; determining at least one transient topic from the accessed electronic content for the time period using a topic extractor; determining contributions of the users to the identified at least one transient topic using a user community detector; determining the community of users as the users that have similar temporal contributions to the at least one identified transient topic using the user community detector; and providing a recommendation based on a determined user community.

2. The method of claim 1, wherein the act of determining the at least one transient topic comprises: annotating the accessed electronic content with at least one semantic concept using a semantic annotator or extracting at least one keyword; generating a concept signal for each at least one semantic concept or at least one keyword by determining the number of times a particular semantic concept or keyword has been observed for the discrete time intervals in the time period; determining correlated semantic concepts or correlated keywords by determining pairwise similarity values for each pair of concept signals; and grouping together temporally related semantic concepts or temporally correlated keywords based on the correlated semantic concepts or correlated keywords to determine the at least one transient topic.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the pairwise similarity values for a given pair of concept signals is obtained by performing a cross-correlation measurement on the given pair of concept signals.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the act of grouping together temporally related semantic concepts or temporally related keywords to determine the at least one transient topic comprises: generating a concept graph which is a weighted unidirectional graph with vertices and edges, where a given vertex is one of the semantic concepts or keywords and a given edge is denoted by a pairwise similarity value of the semantic concepts or keywords associated with the given edge; and applying a graph partitioning method to extract subgraphs of the concept graph, where the semantic concepts or keywords represented by nodes in a given subgraph are combined to determine the at least one transient topic.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein prior to grouping together temporally related semantic concepts or temporally related keywords to determine the at least one transient topic, the method comprises applying filtering to remove low quality semantic concepts or low quality keywords.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the filtering comprises identifying and removing stop concepts or stop keywords that are identified by identifying the semantic concept or keyword having a temporal frequency distribution with a similar pattern as the temporal frequency distribution of all semantic concepts or keywords in the accessed electronic content.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the filtering comprises identifying and removing white noise concepts or white noise keywords that are identified by identifying the semantic concept having a temporal frequency distribution that follows a normal distribution within the time period.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the act of determining the community of users comprises: generating user-topic contribution signals, where a given user-topic contribution signal indicates the given user's contribution to the at least one identified transient topic for each of the discrete time intervals over the time period; determining an inter-similarity distance for each pair of the user-topic contribution signals; generating a weighted user graph having vertices that represent the users that have generated electronic content during the time period and edges defined by the inter-similarity distance for each pair of users; and determining the community of users from the weighted user graph by applying a graph partitioning method as a user community detection method.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises determining a second community of users that has partially overlapping topic interests with the community of users.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the topical relevance of the item to the community of users is based on a third correlation being a cosine similarity of a sum of contributions of each user of the community of users to the one of the at least one transient topic and the item.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein when the recommendation is to be provided is based on the third correlation being higher than a third correlation threshold at a particular one of the discrete time intervals of the time period.
12. A server for determining a community of users with similar temporal behaviour from electronic content generated by a plurality of users, the server being configured to: access the electronic content from a data store, the electronic content being created by the plurality of users during a time period, the electronic content comprising two or more messages having different time stamps within the time period and comprising a plurality of topics; execute instructions for a topic extractor that is configured to determine at least one transient topic out of the plurality of topics from the accessed electronic content for the time period based on a consideration of interactions of the plurality of users with each of the plurality of topics, where the time period comprises discrete time intervals and the time period lasts as long as the at least one transient topic is a collection of semantic concepts or keywords observed in each of the two or more messages that have a first correlation that is higher than a first correlation threshold in two or more of the discrete time intervals in the time period; execute instructions for a user community detector that is configured to determine contributions of the plurality of users to the at least one transient topic during each of the discrete time intervals of the time period and determine the community of users as being a subset of the plurality of users that have temporal contributions to one of the at least one transient topic during each of the discrete time intervals of the time period with a second correlation that is higher than a second correlation threshold; and execute instructions for an output generator that is configured to provide a recommendation of an item based on the determined community of users, a topical relevance of the item to the community of users, and when the recommendation is to be provided.
