SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR FORMING A CUSTOMIZED THERAPEUTIC SUPPORT
</title>

<abstract>
A method of providing therapy to a tissue site. The method may include collecting three- dimensional (3-D) data associated with the tissue site, selecting at least one parameter of a customized tissue support based upon the 3-D data, and fabricating the customized tissue support including the design parameter. The method may further include collecting microbiome data associated with the tissue site. Collecting microbiome data may include collecting a biological sample. Collecting microbiome data may further include amplifying genetic material from the biological sample. Collecting the microbiome data may further include evaluating the genetic material from the biological sample. In some embodiments, the method may further include selecting at least one parameter of a customized splint based upon the microbiome data.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method of providing therapy to a tissue site, the method comprising:
collecting three-dimensional (3-D) data associated with the tissue site;
selecting at least one parameter of a customized tissue support based upon the 3-D data; fabricating the customized tissue support including the design parameter.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the tissue site includes at least a portion of the nasal cavity.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the tissue site includes the paranasal sinuses.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the 3-D data comprises a physical dimension associated with the tissue site.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the 3-D data indicates the presence of an abnormality.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein collecting the 3-D data comprises imaging the tissue site.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein imaging the tissue site comprises performing a computed tomography (CT) scan of the tissue site.
8. The method of claim 6, wherein imaging the tissue site comprises performing a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the tissue site.
9. The method of claim 6, wherein imaging the tissue site comprises performing an ultrasound scan of the tissue site.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein imaging the tissue site comprises performing a PET scan of the tissue site.
11. The method of claim 1, further comprising collecting microbiome data associated with the tissue site.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein collecting microbiome data comprises collecting a biological sample.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein collecting microbiome data further comprises amplifying genetic material from the biological sample.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein collecting the microbiome data further comprises evaluating the genetic material from the biological sample.
15. The method of claim 11, further comprising selecting at least one parameter of a customized splint based upon the microbiome data.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein fabricating the customized tissue support comprises 3-D printing.
17. The method of claim 1, wherein fabricating the customized tissue support comprises 3-D printing a mold.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein fabricating the customized tissue support comprises injection-molding using the mold.
19. A system for providing a customized therapeutic support for therapy of a tissue site, the system comprising:
a customized therapeutic support modeling component configured to:
receive three-dimensional (3-D) data associated with the tissue site; and select at least one parameter of a customized tissue support based upon the 3-D data; and
a fabrication unit in signal communication with the customized therapeutic support modeling component and configured to fabricate the customized tissue support including the design parameter.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein the customized therapeutic support modeling component is further configured to receive microbiome data associated with the tissue site and to select at least one parameter of a customized tissue support based upon the microbiome data.
