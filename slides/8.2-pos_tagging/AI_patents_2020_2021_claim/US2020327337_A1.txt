APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DETECTING OBJECT OF A VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus for detecting an object of a vehicle is provided. The apparatus includes a camera that acquires an image from front of a vehicle and a controller that generates feature pyramid images based on a plurality of feature images extracted from the image. The controller also generates feature aggregation images by filtering the feature pyramid images, detects a pedestrian area from the feature aggregation images, and detects face regions from the feature pyramid images. At least one of the face regions that overlaps the pedestrian area is then determined as a face of a pedestrian.

<claims>
1. An apparatus for detecting an object of a vehicle, comprising: a camera configured to acquire an image of an area in front of the vehicle; and a controller configured to generate feature pyramid images based on a plurality of feature images extracted from the image, generate feature aggregation images by filtering the feature pyramid images, detect a pedestrian area from the feature aggregation images, detect face regions from the feature pyramid images, and determine at least one of the face regions that overlaps the pedestrian area as a face of a pedestrian.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the feature pyramid images are generated by down-scaling the feature image from an original size at a predetermined ratio.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to generate a filter bank by performing a convolution operation or a correlation operation on a first feature filter and a second feature filter and generate the feature aggregation images by filtering the feature pyramid images using the filter bank.
4. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the controller is configured to generate a training feature image based on feature information extracted from a training image and generates the first feature filter from the training feature image based on a Local Binary Pattern method.
5. The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the controller is configured to generate a first feature aggregation image by filtering the training feature image using the first feature filter and generate a second feature filter from the first feature aggregation image based on a Locally De-correction Channel Feature (LDCF) method.
6. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein the controller is configured to generate a training feature aggregation image by filtering the training feature image using the filter bank and generate a pedestrian classifier for classifying the pedestrian area in the training feature aggregation image.
7. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the controller is configured to detect the pedestrian area from the feature aggregation images using the pedestrian classifier.
8. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to synthesize a region, having a highest score among the face regions that overlap the pedestrian area, with the pedestrian area.
9. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the controller is configured to determine the region having the highest score as the face of the pedestrian.
10. The apparatus of claim 9, wherein the controller is configured to calculate a probability that an object of the image in the face region that overlaps the pedestrian area is a face of the pedestrian, and generate the score based on the probability.
11. A method for detecting an object of a vehicle, comprising: acquiring, by a controller, an image of an area in front of the vehicle; generating, by the controller, feature pyramid images based on a plurality of feature images extracted from the image; generating, by the controller, feature aggregation images by filtering the feature pyramid images; detecting, by the controller, a pedestrian area from the feature aggregation images; detecting, by the controller, face regions from the feature pyramid images; and determining, by the controller, at least one of the face regions overlapping the pedestrian area as a face of a pedestrian.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the feature pyramid images are generated by down-scaling the feature image from an original size at a predetermined ratio.
13. The method of claim 11, further comprising: generating, by the controller, a filter bank by performing a convolution operation or a correlation operation on a first feature filter and a second feature filter; and generating, by the controller, the feature aggregation images by filtering the feature pyramid images using the filter bank.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the first feature filter generates a training feature image based on feature information extracted from a training image, and generates the first feature filter from the training feature image based on a Local Binary Pattern method.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the second feature filter generates a first feature aggregation image by filtering the training feature image using the first feature filter and generates a second feature filter from the first feature aggregation image based on a Locally De-correction Channel Feature (LDCF) method.
16. The method of claim 15, further comprising: generating, by the controller, a training feature aggregation image by filtering the training feature image using the filter bank; and generating, by the controller, a pedestrian classifier for classifying the pedestrian area in the training feature aggregation image.
17. The method of claim 16, further comprising: detecting, by the controller, the pedestrian area from the feature aggregation images using the pedestrian classifier.
18. The method of claim 11, further comprising: synthesizing, by the controller, a region, having a highest score among the face regions overlapping the pedestrian area, with the pedestrian area.
19. The method of claim 18, further comprising: determining, by the controller, the region having the highest score as the face of the pedestrian.
20. The method of claim 19, further comprising: calculating, by the controller, a probability that an object of the image in the face region overlapping the pedestrian area is a face of the pedestrian, and generating the score based on the probability.
