<title>
Flow Indicator for an Infusion Pump
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided for signaling a condition of an infusion assembly. A system may comprise an elastomeric pump that includes a chamber for receipt of a volume of fluid, an outer layer configured to expand and contract as the chamber receives and dispenses fluid, and a passive indicator provided on the outer layer for signaling a change in the volume of fluid in the chamber. The system further may comprise an image capture device configured to capture an image of the pump, and a processing system configured to process the image to signal the condition of the infusion assembly to a user of the system. A method may comprise capturing an image of a pump; processing the image; and displaying information to a user of the pump to communicate the condition of the pump to the user. Elastomeric pumps for infusion assemblies also are provided.

<claims>
1. An elastomeric pump for an infusion assembly, the pump comprising: a bladder defining a chamber for receipt of a volume of fluid; an outer layer surrounding the bladder, the outer layer configured to expand as the chamber receives fluid and contract as the chamber dispenses fluid; a first indicator provided on the bladder; a second indicator provided on the outer layer, wherein the first indicator and the second indicator together are a passive indicator configured to align to signal a change in the volume of fluid in the chamber.
2. The pump of claim 1, wherein the second indicator comprises an ink printed on the outer layer.
3. The pump of claim 1, wherein the second indicator is a symbol.
4. The pump of claim 1, wherein the second indicator is configured to increase in size as the outer layer expands and decrease in size as the outer layer contracts.
5. The pump of claim 1, wherein the bladder has a cylindrical shape in the deflated position and a spherical shape in the inflated position.
6. The pump of claim 1, wherein the passive indicator changes color to signal the change in the volume of fluid in the chamber.
7. The pump of claim 6, wherein first indicator is a first indicator color and the second indicator is a second indicator color when the first indicator and the second indicator are unaligned, and wherein the passive indicator is a passive indicator color when the first indicator is aligned with the second indicator.
8. The pump of claim 7, wherein the first indicator color is blue, the second indicator color is yellow, and the passive indicator color is green.
9. The pump of claim 1, wherein the passive indicator changes pattern to signal the change in the volume of fluid in the chamber.
10. The pump of claim 9, wherein first indicator is a first indicator pattern and the second indicator is a second indicator pattern when the first indicator and the second indicator are unaligned, and wherein the passive indicator is a passive indicator pattern when the first indicator is aligned with the second indicator.
11. A method for communicating a condition of an elastomeric pump for an infusion assembly, the method comprising: operating the pump, the pump including a bladder defining a chamber for receipt of a volume of fluid, an outer layer surrounding the bladder that expands as the chamber receives fluid and contracts as the chamber dispenses fluid during operation of the pump, and a passive indicator visible on the outer layer; capturing an image of the passive indicator; processing the image; and displaying information to a user of the pump to communicate the condition of the pump to the user.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the passive indicator comprises a first indicator provided on the bladder and a second indicator provided on the outer layer, and wherein the first indicator and the second indicator align to communicate the condition of the pump.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein each of the first indicator and the second indicator is a color.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein each of the first indicator and the second indicator is a pattern.
15. The method of claim 11, wherein processing the image comprises comparing the image to a stored image.
16. The method of claim 11, wherein the condition is a change in volume of the pump.
17. The method of claim 11, wherein a single device captures the image, processes the image, and displays the information to the user.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the single device is a smartphone.
19. The method of claim 11, wherein capturing the image comprises aligning the pump with guides displayed on a display of a user device configured to capture images.
20. A method for communicating a condition of an elastomeric pump for an infusion assembly, the method comprising: operating the pump, the pump including a bladder defining a chamber for receipt of a volume of fluid, an outer layer surrounding the bladder, the outer layer expanding and contracting during operation of the pump, a first indicator provided on the bladder, and a second indicator provided on the outer layer, the first indicator and the second indicator together forming a passive indicator; and displaying the passive indicator to a user of the pump to communicate the condition of the pump to the user, wherein the first indicator and the second indicator align to display the passive indicator to the user and to signal a change in the volume of fluid in the chamber.
