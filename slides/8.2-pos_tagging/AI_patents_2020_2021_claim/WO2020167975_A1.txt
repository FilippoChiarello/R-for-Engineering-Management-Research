SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR VIRTUAL-REALITY ENHANCED QUANTITATIVE MEDITATION
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein are systems for use with a meditation session, said system comprising: a virtual reality display configured to display a virtual environment comprising a plurality of virtual images to a user while the user meditates; a biometric sensor configured to sense a plurality of biometric parameters of said user; and a processor configured to correlate said virtual environment or at least one virtual image of said plurality of virtual images with at least one biometric parameter of said plurality of biometric parameters.
</abstract>

<claims>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A system for use with a meditation session, said system comprising:
(a) a virtual reality display configured to display a virtual environment comprising a plurality of virtual images to a user while the user meditates;
(b) a biometric sensor configured to sense a plurality of biometric parameters of said user; and
(c) a processor configured to correlate said virtual environment or at least one virtual image of said plurality of virtual images with at least one biometric parameter of said plurality of biometric parameters.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein said display is a head mounted display.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein each of the plurality of virtual images comprises a portion of said virtual environment.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the virtual environment comprises a scene from nature.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the biometric sensor comprises a heart rate sensor, a blood pressure sensor, or an spC sensor.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the biometric sensor is used to determine at least one of a heart rate variability or a respiratory rate.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the system further comprises: (d) an audio output device configured to provide a plurality of audio outputs to the user.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the at least one of the plurality of audio outputs
corresponds to at least one of the plurality of virtual images.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein the processor is further configured to correlate at least one of said audio outputs with at least one of said plurality of biometric parameters.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the processor is further configured to cause said audio output device to again output said at least one of said audio outputs during said meditation session or a subsequent meditation session.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to cause said virtual reality display to display said at least one virtual image to said user during said meditation session or a subsequent meditation session.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to cause said virtual reality display to again display said at least one virtual image to said user when said at least one biometric parameter is a certain value.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein said biometric sensor comprises a heart rate sensor and said certain value is a heart rate less than about 70 beats per minute (bpm).
14. The system of claim 12, wherein said biometric sensor comprises a blood pressure sensor and said certain value is a systolic blood pressure less than about 130 mmHg.
15. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to cause said virtual reality display to again display said at least one virtual image to said user during said meditation session or a subsequent meditation session when said at least one biometric parameter is less than a baseline biometric parameter of the user that is previously sensed.
16. A method for use during a meditation session, said method comprising:
(a) displaying a virtual environment comprising a plurality of virtual images to a user while the user meditates;
(b) sensing a plurality of biometric parameters of said user; and
(c) correlating, with a processor, said virtual environment or at least one virtual image of said plurality of virtual images with at least one biometric parameter of said plurality of biometric parameters.
17. A non-transitory computer readable storage medium comprising computer readable
software configured to cause a processor to:
(d) display a virtual environment comprising a plurality of virtual images to a user while the user meditates;
(e) sense a plurality of biometric parameters of said user; and
(f) correlate said virtual environment or at least one virtual image of said plurality of virtual images with at least one biometric parameter of said plurality of biometric parameters.
18. A computer implemented method for providing a meditation session, said method
comprising:
(a) sensing at least one parameter from an individual while said individual is meditating during a meditation session;
(b) inputting the at least one parameter into a machine learning software
module; and
(c) determining, with the machine learning software module, a modification of the meditation session.
19. The method of claim 18, comprising displaying, with a display, a virtual environment comprising a plurality of virtual images to a user while the user meditates.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein said display is a head mounted display.
21. The method of claim 19, wherein each of the plurality of virtual images comprises a
portion of said virtual or augmented environment.
22. The method of claim 21, wherein the virtual environment comprises a scene from nature.
23. The method of claim 18, wherein the at least one parameter comprises a heart rate, a blood pressure, or an spC .
24. The method of claim 18, wherein the at least one parameter comprises at least one of a heart rate variability or a respiratory rate.
25. The method of claim 18, comprising outputting a plurality of audio outputs to the
individual.
26. The method of claim 25, wherein the at least one of the plurality of audio outputs
corresponds to at least one of a plurality of virtual images.
27. The method of claim 26, comprising correlating at least one of said audio outputs with the at least one parameter.
28. The method of claim 27, wherein the processor is further configured to cause said audio output device to again output said at least one of said audio outputs during said meditation session or a subsequent meditation session.
