DYNAMIC MUSIC CREATION IN GAMING
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for dynamic music creation is disclosed. An emotion is assigned to one or more musical motifs and a game vector is associated with the emotion. The one or more musical motifs are mapped to the game vector based on the emotion. A musical composition is generated based on the game vector and desired emotions.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for dynamic music creation comprising;
a) assigning an emotion to one or more musical motifs;
b) associating a game vector with the emotion;
c) mapping the one or more musical motifs to the game vector based on the emotion;
d) generating a musical composition based on the game vector and desired emotions.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the emotion is assigned to the one or more musical motifs by a neural network trained to assign emotions to music based on content.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein a level is assigned to the emotion and the mapping of the one or more musical motifs to the game vector changes with the level assigned to the emotion.
4. The method of claim 3 wherein the level assigned to the emotion is changed using an emotion level slider.
5. The method of claim 1 further comprising associating a user behavior to the emotion and mapping the one or more musical motifs to the user behavior based on the emotion.
6. The method of claim 1 further comprising assignment of the one or more musical motifs to the emotion based on a physical response of a user to each of the one or more musical motifs.
7. The method of claim 1 further comprising assigning one of one or more motifs to a game vector as a default motif and wherein the default motif is included in the musical composition whenever the game vector is present within a videogame.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the game vector includes a game element and a trigger for the game element within a videogame.
9. The method of claim 8 further comprising assigning one of the one or more motifs to a game element as a default motif for the game element and including the default motif in the musical composition whenever the game element is present within the videogame.
10. The method of claim 8 further comprising assigning one of the one or more motifs to the trigger as a default motif for the trigger and including the default motif in the musical composition whenever the trigger is activated within the videogame.
11. The method of claim 1 wherein generating a musical composition comprises selecting one of the one or more musical motifs to play while a videogame is being played wherein the musical motifs are played contemporaneously with the videogame.
12. The method of claim 1 further comprising a generating an event cue for a videogame wherein the event cue includes upcoming events within a videogame and wherein the event cue is used during generation of the musical composition.
13. The method of claim 12 wherein the event cue includes an event probability, event timing, and an event emotional weight, wherein the event probability defines the likelihood an event will occur within the event timing and wherein the event emotional weight provides the emotion of the event.
13. The method of claim 12 wherein the event emotional weight includes a level for the emotion.
14. A system for dynamic music creation comprising;
a processor;
a memory coupled to the processor;
non-transitory instructions embedded in the memory that when executed cause the processor to carry out the method comprising:
a) assigning an emotion to one or more musical motifs;
b) associating a game vector with the emotion;
c) mapping one or more musical motifs to the game vector based on the emotion;
d) generating a musical composition based on the game vector and desired emotions.
15. The system of claim 14 wherein the emotion is assigned to the one or more musical motifs by a neural network trained to assign emotions to music based on content.
16. The system of claim 14 wherein a level is assigned to the emotion and the mapping of the one or more musical motifs to the game vector changes with the level assigned to the emotion.
17. The system of claim 16 further comprising an emotion slider coupled to the processor wherein the emotion slider is configured to control the level assigned to the emotion.
18. The system of claim 14 further comprising assignment of the one or more musical motifs to the emotion based on a physical response of a user to each of the one or more musical motifs.
19. The system of claim 18 further comprising a biometric device coupled to the processor and configured to track the physical response of the user.
20. Non-transitory instructions embedded in a computer readable medium that when executed cause a computer to perform the method comprising;
a) assigning an emotion to one or more musical motifs;
b) associating a game vector with the emotion;
c) mapping one or more musical motifs to the game vector based on the emotion;
d) generating a musical composition based on the game vector and desired emotions.
