Table game management system, substitute currency for gaming, and inspection device
</title>

<abstract>
A table game management system according to the present invention includes: a camera (4) that images a game token (100) placed on a game table (1); and a management control device (9) that grasps a type (10 points, 20 points, 100 points, 1,000 points, or the like) of the game token (100) placed on the game table (1) based on a color of a side face of the game token (100) imaged by the camera (4).
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A table game management system comprising: a camera that images a game token placed on a game table; and a management controller, wherein: the management controller is configured to use an image of a game token generated by the camera when the game token is on a game table to identify a type of the game token based on a color of a side face of the game token as captured in the image; the color, on the basis of which the management controller is configured to identify the type, is a first color of a pattern on the side face of the game token captured in the image, the pattern being made up of the first color, which corresponds to the type of the game token, and a second color that is not dependent on the type of the game token; and each of the first color of the pattern and the second color of the pattern extends in a direction that is circumferential about the game token.
2. The table game management system according to claim 1, wherein the side face of the game token has a portion whose color changes in a thickness direction of the game token.
3. The table game management system according to claim 1, wherein: the pattern is a striped pattern made up of at least one layer characterized by the first color, which corresponds to the type of the game token, and at least one layer characterized by the second color that is not dependent on the type of the game token; and the management controller is configured to identify a number of the at least one layer characterized by the first color or of the at least one layer characterized by the second color in the striped pattern of the game token and, based on the identified number of the at least one layer, determine how many of the game token are present on the game table.
4. The table game according to claim 3, wherein the layers of the striped pattern include layers characterized by the second color arranged on both sides of a layer characterized by the first color.
5. The table game according to claim 3, wherein at least one layer of the pattern of the game token includes a plurality of layers characterized by the first color.
6. The table game management system according to claim 1, wherein the image is of the game token captured while the game token is held in a chip tray on the game table.
7. The table game according to claim 1, wherein the pattern of the game token is formed by a plastic layer of the first color and a plastic layer of the second color being laminated together.
8. The table game according to claim 7, wherein the plastic layer of the first color and the plastic layer of the second color are thermocompression bonded.
9. The table game according to claim 1, wherein a sign representing the type of the game token is on the side face.
10. The table game according to claim 9, wherein the sign is formed of ultraviolet (UV) ink or carbon black ink.
11. The table game according to claim 1, wherein an outermost layer of the game token is transparent.
12. The table game according to claim 11, wherein the transparent layer is embossed.
13. The table game according to claim 11, wherein an end of the transparent layer is rounded.
14. The table game according to claim 1, wherein a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is embedded in the game token.
15. The table game management system according to claim 1, wherein the management controller is configured to additionally identify the type of the game token in another manner that is not based on the color of the side face of the game token as captured in the image, and is configured to determine whether the type identified based on the color of the side face of the game token as captured in the image matches the type identified in the other manner.
16. The table game management system according to claim 1, wherein the extension of the first color is continuous about an entire circumference of the game token.
17. The table game management system according to claim 1, wherein the extension of the second color is continuous about an entire circumference of the game token.
18. The table game management system according to claim 1, wherein the extensions of the first color and the second color are each continuous about an entire circumference of the game token.
