ENHANCED INVERSION IMAGING
</title>

<abstract>
Data filtering and processing techniques for generating improved wellbore resistivity maps are contemplated. In some aspects, a process of the disclosed technology includes steps for receiving a plurality of measurement sets, wherein each measurement set includes electromagnetic field data associated with a geologic formation, performing an inversion on each of the plurality of measurement sets to generate a corresponding plurality of formation profiles, and applying a filter to each of the formation profiles to generate a plurality of profile clusters. In some aspects, the process can further include steps for selecting a representative cluster from among the profile clusters for use in generating a wellbore resistivity map. Systems and machine-readable media are also provided.
