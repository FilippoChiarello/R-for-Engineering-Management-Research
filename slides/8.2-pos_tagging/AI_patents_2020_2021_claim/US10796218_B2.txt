Communications system with smart agent robots for accessing message data
</title>

<abstract>
A communications system with smart agent robots includes a message interface, a first agent robot, a friend agent robot and a friend message interface. The message interface is used for inputting message data. The first agent robot is connected to the message interface for integrating and transceiving the message data automatically. The friend agent robot is connected to the first agent robot for communicating with the first agent robot. The friend message interface is connected to the friend agent robot for communicating with the first agent robot.

<claims>
1. A communications system with smart agent robots comprising: a message interface configured to input message data; a first agent robot connected to the message interface and configured to automatically integrate and transceive the message data after a first user accesses the first agent robot by using a first personal identity; a second agent robot connected to the message interface and configured to automatically integrate and transceive the message data after the first user accesses the second agent robot by using a second personal identity; a friend agent robot operated by a second user and connected to the first agent robot for communicating with the first agent robot; and a friend message interface connected to the friend agent robot and configured to communicate with the first agent robot; wherein each of the first agent robot, the second agent robot, and the friend agent robot comprises a chat bot for automatically responding to the message data, the first user has a plurality of identities, the first agent robot automatically requests the second agent robot for providing a service of the second agent robot according to the message data.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein when an agent permission of the first agent robot is enabled, the first agent robot responds to message data inputted to the friend message interface through the friend agent robot.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein when an agent permission of the first agent robot is enabled, the first agent robot responds to message data inputted to the friend message interface directly.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the first agent robot has a machine learning capability or an artificial intelligence deep learning capability.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the friend agent robot is further connected to the second agent robot and configured to communicate with the second agent robot, and the second agent robot responds to message data inputted to the friend message interface through the friend agent robot.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the friend agent robot is further connected to the second agent robot and configured to selectively communicate with the second agent robot, and the second agent robot responds to message data inputted to the friend message interface.
7. The system of claim 1, further comprising: at least one server, each server configured to store data; and at least one external agent robot, each external agent robot connected to a corresponding server and the first agent robot and configured to communicate with the first agent robot; wherein when a request message is inputted to the message interface, the first agent robot collects the data of the at least one server through the at least one external agent robot according to the request message.
8. The system of claim 1, further comprising: at least one server, each server configured to store data; and at least one external agent robot, each external agent robot connected to a corresponding server and the first agent robot and configured to communicate with the first agent robot; wherein when a request message is inputted to the friend message interface, the friend agent robot requests the first agent robot to collect the data of the at least one server through the at least one external agent robot.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein a database of the first agent robot is exchangeable and expandable.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the first agent robot and the friend agent robot are virtual agent robots, the message interface and the first agent robot are integrated inside a first mobile device, and the friend agent robot and the friend message interface are integrated inside a second mobile device.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the first agent robot is capable of transceiving data under a first instant message platform, and the friend agent robot is capable of transceiving data under a second instant message platform.
12. A communications system with smart agent robots comprising: a message interface configured to input message data; a first agent robot connected to the message interface and configured to automatically integrate and transceive the message data; a friend agent robot connected to the first agent robot and configured to communicate with the first agent robot; and a friend message interface connected to the friend agent robot and configured to communicate with the first agent robot; wherein the first agent robot is capable of transceiving data under a first instant message platform, and the friend agent robot is capable of transceiving data under a second instant message platform.
