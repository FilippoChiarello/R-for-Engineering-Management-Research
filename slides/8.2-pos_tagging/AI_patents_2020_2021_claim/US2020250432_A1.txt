<title>
ANNOTATION DEVICE, ANNOTATION METHOD, AND NON-TRANSITORY COMPUTER-READABLE STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
An annotation device includes: a similarity information obtainer that obtains similarity information indicating whether or not a plurality of labels to be added as annotation data to images are similar to each other; a determiner that determines a layout of the plurality of labels to be displayed on an operation screen for an annotation operation based on the similarity information; a data obtainer communicator that obtains the annotation data added to the images using the operation screen; and an inspector that inspects the annotation data obtained by the second communicator for an erroneously added label.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An annotation device, comprising: a similarity information obtainer that obtains similarity information indicating whether or not a plurality of labels to be added as annotation data to an image are similar to each other; a determiner that determines a layout of the plurality of labels to be displayed on an operation screen for an annotation operation based on the similarity information; a data obtainer that obtains the annotation data added to the images using the operation screen; and an inspector that inspects the annotation data obtained by the data obtainer for an erroneously added label.
2. The annotation device according to claim 1, wherein the plurality of labels include a first label and a second label that are similar to each other, and a third label that is dissimilar to the first label and the second label, and the determiner determines the layout to display the third label between the first label and the second label on the operation screen.
3. The annotation device according to claim 2, wherein the inspector includes a recognizer that has been trained using a predetermined set of training data, and determines that a label included in the annotation data obtained has been erroneously added, if, out of the plurality of labels, a label corresponding to a recognition result of an image obtained by the recognizer is, on the operation screen, adjacent to the label included in the annotation data obtained.
4. The annotation device according to claim 2, wherein the plurality of labels further include a fourth label dissimilar to the first label, the second label, and the third label, and the determiner determines the layout to further display the fourth label between the first label and the second label on the operation screen.
5. The annotation device according to claim 1, wherein the determiner further determines display colors of the plurality of labels arranged on the operation screen based on the similarity information.
6. The annotation device according to claim 5, wherein the determiner determines display colors of similar ones of the plurality of labels to be more similar to each other than a display color(s) of a non-similar label(s) among the plurality of labels.
7. The annotation device according to claim 1, further comprising: a label information obtainer that obtains label information to be added to the images, wherein if the label information includes three or more labels, the similarity information obtainer obtains similarity information on the three or more labels out of the plurality of labels.
8. An annotation method, comprising: obtaining similarity information indicating whether or not a plurality of labels to be added as annotation data to images are similar to each other; determining a layout of the plurality of labels to be displayed on an operation screen for an annotation operation based on the similarity information; obtaining the annotation data added to the images using the operation screen; and inspecting the annotation data obtained in the obtaining of the annotation data for an erroneously added label.
9. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium for use in a computer, the storage medium having a computer program recorded thereon for causing the computer to execute the annotation method according to claim 8.
