METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR INJURY SEGMENT DETERMINATION
</title>

<abstract>
A method of determining an injury segment includes training a machine learning model, receiving a loss report, analyzing the loss report using the trained model to determine a severity of an injury, determining, based on the severity of the injury, an injury segment, and storing, via a processor, an indication of the injury segment. A computer system includes a processor configured to train a machine learning model, receive a loss report, analyze the loss report using the trained model to determine the severity of an injury, determine an injury segment, and store an indication of the injury segment. A non-transitory computer readable medium containing program instructions that when executed cause a computer to train a machine learning model, receive a loss report, analyze the loss report using the trained model to determine the severity of an injury, determine an injury segment, and store an indication of the injury segment.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method of determining an injury segment, comprising: training, via a processor, a machine learning model using historical claim data to determine an injury claim severity, receiving, via a processor, an auto accident loss report, analyzing the loss report using the trained machine learning model to determine a severity of an injury, determining, based on the severity of the injury, an injury segment, and storing, via a processor, an indication of the injury segment.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein determining, based on the severity of the injury, the injury segment includes assigning the loss report to one or more tiers.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, wherein the one or more tiers are hierarchically related.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein determining, based on the severity of the injury, the injury segment includes assigning the loss report to one or more ordered tiers, to create a routing.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, wherein the one or more ordered tiers are hierarchically related.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the severity is expressed by a numeric severity level.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model is an artificial neural network.
8. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the loss report includes one or both of (i) a photograph corresponding to the accident, and (ii) a textual description corresponding to the accident.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein analyzing the loss report using the trained machine learning model to determine the severity of the injury includes analyzing electronic claim records corresponding to the accident.
10. The computer-implemented method of claim 9, further comprising: analyzing vehicle telematics information.
11. A computer system configured to determine an injury segment, the system comprising one or more processors configured to: train, via the one or more processors, a machine learning model using historical claim data to determine an injury claim severity, receive, via the one or more processors, an auto accident loss report, analyze the loss report using the trained machine learning model to determine a severity of an injury, determine, based on the severity of the injury, an injury segment, and store, via the one or more processors, an indication of the injury segment.
12. The computer system of claim 11, further configured to: assign the loss report to one or more tiers.
13. The computer system of claim 11, further configured to: determine a routing and route the injury claim via the routing.
14. The computer system of claim 11, wherein the machine learning model is an artificial neural network.
15. The computer system of claim 11, further configured to: analyze vehicle telematics information.
16. A non-transitory computer readable medium containing program instructions that when executed, cause a computer to: train, via the one or more processors, a machine learning model using historical claim data to determine an injury claim severity, receive, via the one or more processors, an auto accident loss report, analyze the loss report using the trained machine learning model to determine a severity of an injury, determine, based on the severity of the injury, an injury segment, and store, via the one or more processors, an indication of the injury segment in association with the loss report.
17. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, containing further program instructions that when executed, cause a computer to: assign the loss report to one or more tiers.
18. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, containing further program instructions that when executed, cause a computer to: determine a routing and route the injury claim via the routing.
19. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, containing further program instructions that when executed, cause a computer to: analyze vehicle telematics information.
20. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, wherein the machine learning model is an artificial neural network.
