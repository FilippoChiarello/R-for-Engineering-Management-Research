System and method for tracking machine use
</title>

<abstract>
A tracking apparatus for a machine having an operation assembly is disclosed. The tracking apparatus has an electric relay configured to be connected to the operation assembly, a tracking device that is connected to the electric relay, and an electronic payment device that is connected to the electric relay. The electric relay is configured to transfer a first electrical pulse from the operation assembly to the tracking device. The electric relay is configured to transfer a second electrical pulse from either the electronic payment device or the operation assembly to the tracking device. The relay transfers the first electrical pulse or the second electrical pulse when the operation assembly performs an operation.

<claims>
1. A tracking apparatus for a machine having an operation assembly, comprising: an electric relay configured to be connected to the operation assembly; a tracking device that is connected to the electric relay; and an electronic payment device that is connected to the electric relay; wherein the electric relay is configured to transfer a first electrical pulse from the operation assembly to the tracking device; wherein the electric relay is configured to transfer a second electrical pulse from either the electronic payment device or the operation assembly to the tracking device; and wherein the electric relay transfers the first electrical pulse or the second electrical pulse when the operation assembly performs an operation.
2. The tracking apparatus of claim 1, wherein the first and second electrical pulses are 12 volt DC electrical pulses.
3. The tracking apparatus of claim 1, wherein the electric relay is a 12 volt electric relay.
4. The tracking apparatus of claim 1, wherein the electric relay is a double pole double throw relay.
5. The tracking apparatus of claim 1, wherein the electronic payment device is selected from the group consisting of a PayRange Blue Key Plus device, a Pay Range Blue Key Smart device, a Touch Tunes device, and an AMI device.
6. The tracking apparatus of claim 5, wherein the electronic payment device is connected to the electric relay via a wire being connected from a position on a relay board of the PayRange Blue Key Plus device to the electric relay.
7. The tracking apparatus of claim 6, wherein the relay board is a Pay Range Relay Board part #8856046 and the position on the relay board is a K1 position.
8. The tracking apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a deep cell battery that is electrically connected to the tracking device.
9. The tracking apparatus of claim 8, wherein the deep cell battery is a 12 volt DC battery.
10. The tracking apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a display board configured to be disposed on the machine, the display board including a plurality of light-emitting diodes.
11. The tracking apparatus of claim 1, wherein the tracking device is a 5 to 24 volt DC coin counter.
12. The tracking apparatus of claim 1, wherein the tracking device is selected from the group consisting of a pool table tracking device and an automated teller machine tracking device.
13. A method, comprising: providing an operation assembly of a game machine; connecting an electric relay to the operation assembly; connecting a tracking device to the electric relay; connecting an electronic payment device to the electric relay; transferring a first electrical pulse from the operation assembly to the tracking device via the electric relay; transferring a second electrical pulse from either the electronic payment device or the operation assembly to the tracking device via the electric relay; and transferring the first electrical pulse or the second electrical pulse when the operation assembly releases at least one playing object of the game machine.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the operation assembly includes a pool table switch that releases at least one playing object that is a plurality of pool balls of the game machine that is a pool table.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein the operation assembly includes a mechanical push slot of the game machine that is a pool table.
16. The method of claim 13, further comprising connecting a battery to the tracking device, and selectively connecting the battery to an electrical outlet via an electrical wire.
17. A pool table machine, comprising: a pool ball release switch; an electric relay that is connected to the pool ball release switch; a tracking device that is connected to the electric relay; and an electronic payment device that is connected to the electric relay; wherein the electric relay is configured to transfer a first electrical pulse from the pool ball release switch to the tracking device; wherein the electric relay is configured to transfer a second electrical pulse from either the electronic payment device or the pool ball release switch to the tracking device; and wherein the electric relay transfers the first electrical pulse or the second electrical pulse when the pool ball release switch releases a plurality of pool balls from a cavity of the pool table machine.
18. The pool table machine of claim 17, wherein the electric relay is a 12 volt double pole double throw relay.
19. The pool table machine of claim 17, wherein the electronic payment device is selected from the group consisting of a PayRange Blue Key Plus device, a Pay Range Blue Key Smart device, a Touch Tunes device, and an AMI device, and is connected to the electric relay via a wire being connected from a position on a relay board of the electronic payment device to the electric relay.
20. The pool table machine of claim 19, wherein the relay board is a Pay Range Relay Board part #8856046 and the position on the relay board is a K1 position.
