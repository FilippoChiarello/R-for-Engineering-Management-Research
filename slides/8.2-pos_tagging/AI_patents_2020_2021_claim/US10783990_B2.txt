<title>
Clinical trial re-evaluation system
</title>

<abstract>
A clinical trial re-evaluation system is operable to perform at least one assessment function on a set of medical scans for each of a first subset of a set of patients of a failed clinical trial to generate automated assessment data for each of the first subset of the set of patients. The first subset of the set of patients corresponds to a subset of human assessment data determined to have failed to meet criteria of the clinical trial. Patient re-evaluation data is generated for each of the first subset of the set of patients by comparing the automated assessment data to the criteria. The patient re-evaluation data for a second subset of the first subset of the set of patients indicates the automated assessment data passes the criteria. Trial re-evaluation data is generated based on the patient re-evaluation data for transmission to a computing device for display.
