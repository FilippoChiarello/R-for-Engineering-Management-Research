<claims>
1. A method for determining a ground/machine interaction model during boring of a ground by a tunnel boring machine, said method comprising the following steps: S1: obtaining a set of parameters characterizing a bore by at least one given tunnel boring machine over at least one boring site, S2: identifying a set of formulas depending on all or part of the boring parameters, S3: determining a set of variables based on the formulas thus identified, S4: applying a non-supervised classification algorithm to the variables so as to obtain groups of individuals identified according to a predefined criterion of said algorithm, S5: applying a supervised classification algorithm to the variables and to the groups of individuals thus determined so as to obtain a ground/machine interaction model connecting said variables to said groups.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the non-supervised classification comprises a clustering algorithm.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the supervised classification comprises a random forest algorithm.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein the variables depend on at least one of the following boring parameters: a torque of a cutting wheel of the given tunnel boring machine, a speed of rotation of the cutting wheel of the given tunnel boring machine, a speed of advance of the given tunnel boring machine, a contact force of the given tunnel boring machine, a surface area of the cutting wheel of the given tunnel boring machine, a radius of the cutting wheel of the given tunnel boring machine, a confinement pressure at the axis of the given tunnel boring machine.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the non-supervised classification step S4 determines between 8 and 10 different groups of individuals.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein each variable describes a ground segment, and wherein the groups of individuals determined in step S4 correspond to groups of ground segments.
7. A method for optimizing the characteristics of a tunnel boring machine, said method comprising the following steps: S0: determining a ground/machine interaction model according to claim 1, S11: instantaneous measurement of the set of specific boring parameters of the tunnel boring machine, S13: determining the group of individuals corresponding to the boring parameters measured in step S11 by means of the ground/machine interaction model, S14: optimizing the characteristics of the tunnel boring machine as a function of the group of individuals thus determined.
8. The method according to claim 7, also comprising, prior to step S13, a step consisting of calculating all or a part of the variables determined in step S3 based on the boring parameters measured in step S11, and wherein, during step S13, the group of individuals is determined by applying the ground/machine interaction model and to the variables thus determined.
9. The method according to claim 7, wherein, during boring, the tunnel boring machine successively deposits a plurality of rings, and the steps S11 to S14 are repeated during the deposit of each ring.
10. A computer program product comprising code instructions for executing a method for determining a ground/machine interaction model during boring of a ground by a tunnel boring machine.
