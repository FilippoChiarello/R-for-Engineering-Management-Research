<title>
Search for information related to an incident
</title>

<abstract>
Computer-implemented method for searching for information related to an incident generated in a server system, a system and a computer program product. The method includes extracting context information from a current ticket describing the incident, the context information including a first expression describing a symptom of the incident and indicating at least one component of the server system associated with the symptom; determining a data source which generates data in which the information related to the incident is to be searched for at least according to the at least one component; and using the first expression describing the symptom and a second different expression describing the symptom as keywords to search for the information related to the incident in the data.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving a machine data model (MDM) data set that includes information indicative of an MDM for a server system, the MDM including: (i) a plurality of server nodes of the server system, with each server node respectively including a set of server node name(s), (ii) a plurality of middleware nodes respectively running on the server nodes, with each middleware node respectively including a set of middleware node name(s), (iii) a plurality of applications respectively running on the middleware nodes or on the server nodes, with each application node respectively including a set of application node name(s), and (iv) a plurality of links among and between the server nodes, the middleware nodes and the application nodes; receiving a ticket data set including information indicative of an operational incident that occurred with the server system, with the information indicative of the operational incident including unstructured text; processing the unstructured text to determine a first ticket-indicated component, with the first ticket-indicated component corresponding to a first text string included in the unstructured text of the ticket that matches one of the following: (i) a server node name, (ii) a middleware node name, or (iii) an application node name; analyzing the unstructured text by a Latent Dirichlet model to determine a topic of the ticket data set; determining a first expansion component that is linked to the first ticket-indicated component by a link of the plurality of links in the MDM data set; and determining a similar ticket data set based, at least in part, upon the first expansion component and the topic of the ticket data set.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the determination of the similar ticket data set includes: determining a vector characterizing the ticket data set; for each given historical ticket data set of the plurality of historical ticket data set: determining a vector characterizing the given historical ticket data set, and determining a cosine value for the given historical data set, with the cosine value being the cosine between: (i) the vector characterizing the given historical ticket data set and (ii) the vector characterizing the ticket data set; and determining the similar ticket data set as the historical ticket data set having the largest cosine value.
3. A computer program product (CPP) comprising: a machine readable storage device; and computer code stored on the machine readable storage device, with the computer code including instructions for causing a processor(s) set to perform operations including the following: receiving a machine data model (MDM) data set that includes information indicative of an MDM for a server system, the MDM including: (i) a plurality of server nodes of the server system, with each server node respectively including a set of server node name(s), (ii) a plurality of middleware nodes respectively running on the server nodes, with each middleware node respectively including a set of middleware node name(s), (iii) a plurality of applications respectively running on the middleware nodes or on the server nodes, with each application node respectively including a set of application node name(s), and (iv) a plurality of links among and between the server nodes, the middleware nodes and the application nodes, receiving a ticket data set including information indicative of an operational incident that occurred with the server system, with the information indicative of the operational incident including unstructured text, processing the unstructured text to determine a first ticket-indicated component, with the first ticket-indicated component corresponding to a first text string included in the unstructured text of the ticket that matches one of the following: (i) a server node name, (ii) a middleware node name, or (iii) an application node name, analyzing the unstructured text by a Latent Dirichlet model to determine a topic of the ticket data set, determining a first expansion component that is linked to the first ticket-indicated component by a link of the plurality of links in the MDM data set, and determining a similar ticket data set based, at least in part, upon the first expansion component and the topic of the ticket data set.
4. The CPP of claim 3 wherein the determination of the similar ticket data set includes: determining a vector characterizing the ticket data set; for each given historical ticket data set of the plurality of historical ticket data set: determining a vector characterizing the given historical ticket data set, and determining a cosine value for the given historical data set, with the cosine value being the cosine between: (i) the vector characterizing the given historical ticket data set and (ii) the vector characterizing the ticket data set; and determining the similar ticket data set as the historical ticket data set having the largest cosine value.
5. A computer system (CS) comprising: a processor(s) set; a machine readable storage device; and computer code stored on the machine readable storage device, with the computer code including instructions for causing the processor(s) set to perform operations including the following: receiving a machine data model (MDM) data set that includes information indicative of an MDM for a server system, the MDM including: (i) a plurality of server nodes of the server system, with each server node respectively including a set of server node name(s), (ii) a plurality of middleware nodes respectively running on the server nodes, with each middleware node respectively including a set of middleware node name(s), (iii) a plurality of applications respectively running on the middleware nodes or on the server nodes, with each application node respectively including a set of application node name(s), and (iv) a plurality of links among and between the server nodes, the middleware nodes and the application nodes, receiving a ticket data set including information indicative of an operational incident that occurred with the server system, with the information indicative of the operational incident including unstructured text, processing the unstructured text to determine a first ticket-indicated component, with the first ticket-indicated component corresponding to a first text string included in the unstructured text of the ticket that matches one of the following: (i) a server node name, (ii) a middleware node name, or (iii) an application node name, analyzing the unstructured text by a Latent Dirichlet model to determine a topic of the ticket data set, determining a first expansion component that is linked to the first ticket-indicated component by a link of the plurality of links in the MDM data set, and determining a similar ticket data set based, at least in part, upon the first expansion component and the topic of the ticket data set.
6. The CS of claim 5 wherein the determination of the similar ticket data set includes: determining a vector characterizing the ticket data set; for each given historical ticket data set of the plurality of historical ticket data set: determining a vector characterizing the given historical ticket data set, and determining a cosine value for the given historical data set, with the cosine value being the cosine between: (i) the vector characterizing the given historical ticket data set and (ii) the vector characterizing the ticket data set; and determining the similar ticket data set as the historical ticket data set having the largest cosine value.
