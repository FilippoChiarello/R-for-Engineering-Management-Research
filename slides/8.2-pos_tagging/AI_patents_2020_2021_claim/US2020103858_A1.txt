<title>
SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ENCRYPTING DATA BETWEEN MODULES OF A CONTROL SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
An industrial automation system may include an automation device and a control system. The control system may be communicatively coupled to the automation device and may include a first module that may receive a request for information regarding the automation device. The first module may then determine information related to the request for information based on one or more datasets locally available to the first module, alter the information based on a signal configured to obscure the information, and send encrypted information to a second module of the plurality of modules.

<claims>
1. An industrial automation system, comprising: an automation device; and a control system communicatively coupled to the automation device, wherein the control system comprises a first module of a plurality of modules configured to: receive a request for information regarding the automation device; determine information related to the request for information based on one or more datasets locally available to the first module; alter the information based on a signal configured to obscure the information, thereby generating encrypted information; and send the encrypted information to a second module of the plurality of modules.
2. The industrial automation system of claim 1, comprising a routing system configured to route one or more additional datasets related to the request for information to the control system.
3. The industrial automation system of claim 2, wherein the control system is configured to determine the information related to the request for information based on the one or more datasets and the one or more additional datasets.
4. The industrial automation system of claim 2, wherein the control system is configured to route the one or more additional datasets from one or more databases.
5. The industrial automation system of claim 1, wherein the first module comprises an artificial intelligence module configured to determine the information based on one or more machine learning algorithms.
6. The industrial automation system of claim 1, wherein the second module comprises a control module configured to control one or more operations of the automation device.
7. The industrial automation system of claim 1, wherein the request for information comprises a natural language request.
8. The industrial automation system of claim 1, wherein the control system is configured to determine the signal based on a random signal and a security-validation model.
9. A method for operating an industrial automation system, comprising: receiving, via a first module of a control system, a request for information regarding an automation device communicatively coupled to the control system; determining, via the first module, information related to the request for information based on one or more datasets locally available to the first module; altering, via the first module, the information based on a signal configured to obscure the information, thereby generating encrypted information; and sending, via the first module, the encrypted information to a second module of the control system.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein altering the information comprises embedding the signal into the information, wherein the signal is locally available to the first module and the second module.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein altering the information comprises: retrieving a security-validation model from a storage location locally accessible by the first module; determining an encryption signal based on a first signal and the security-validation model; and injecting the encryption signal into the information.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the encryption signal is determined by applying the first signal to the security-validation model.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the first signal comprises a randomly generated signal.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein the security-validation model is stored in an additional storage location locally accessible to the second module.
15. A control module of a plurality of modules in a control system for operating an industrial automation system, wherein the control module is configured to: receive encrypted information from a second module of the plurality of modules via a data backplane, wherein the encrypted information is encrypted based on a security-validation model locally accessible to second module; decrypt the encrypted information based on the security-validation model locally accessible to control module, thereby generating decrypted information; and adjust one or more operations of one or more industrial automation devices of the industrial automation system based on the decrypted information.
16. The control module of claim 15, wherein the control module is configured to: receive a first signal form the second module; and decrypt the encrypted information based on the security-validation model and the first signal.
17. The control module of claim 16, wherein the first signal comprises a random signal generated by the second module.
18. The control module of claim 16, wherein the second module is configured to: determine an encryption signal by applying the first signal to the security-validation model; and inject the encryption signal into information, thereby generating the encrypted information.
19. The control module of claim 15, wherein the data backplane is configured to communicatively couple the plurality of modules to each other.
20. The control module of claim 15, wherein data communicated between the plurality of modules is encrypted based on the security-validation model, and wherein each module of the plurality of modules comprises a local copy of the security-validation model.
