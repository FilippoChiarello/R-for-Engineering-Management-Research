Method and/or system for reconstructing from images a personalized 3D human body model and thereof
</title>

<abstract>
A human body modelling method and apparatus and an electronic device. The method comprises: acquiring at least one human body image; extracting an original profile of a human body from the human body image; calculating a body surface profile of the human body according to the original profile; and constructing a three dimensional human body model according to the body surface profile. The establishment of a three dimensional human body model originates from two dimensional human body images, without using a human body scanner to scan a human body, which reduces the cost of establishing the three dimensional human body model. Moreover, there is no requirement for the position and dressing of a human body object, and the process of establishing the three dimensional human body model is more convenient.
