<title>
Occupancy pattern detection, estimation and prediction
</title>

<abstract>
A system for detecting occupancy of an enclosure may include a sensing system adapted to monitor utility information for the enclosure which tends to indicate a likelihood of occupancy of the enclosure. The utility information may include power line information, Smart Meter information, Wi-Fi information, etc. The system may also include a processing system programmed to estimate occupancy of the enclosure based at least in part on the monitored utility information by the sensing system.

<claims>
1. A system for detecting occupancy of an enclosure comprising: a hardware sensing system adapted to monitor utility information for the enclosure, wherein the utility information comprises a measure of electrical power used within the enclosure; a hardware processing system programmed to: analyze the utility information monitored by the sensing system to filter a main power line and thereby detect the use of one or more electronic devices; determine whether the use of the one or more electronic devices detected from filtering the main power line indicates a likelihood of current occupancy of the enclosure by one or more humans; estimate a probability of occupancy of the enclosure by one or more humans based at least in part on: the likelihood of current occupancy indicated by the use of the one or more electronic devices detected from filtering the main power line; and a historical probability distribution of occupancy that is fitted using previously detected departure and arrival times; and cause a home system to operate based on the estimate of the probability.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the utility information comprises power line information.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the power line information is filtered to detect the use of the electronic devices.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the utility information is obtained from a Smart Meter.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein pattern recognition is used by the processing system to monitor changes in the utility information from a baseline to detect the use of the one or more electronic devices.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the utility information further comprises a Wi-Fi signal that is monitored.
7. The system of claim 1, further comprising: a sensor configured to detect occupancy within the enclosure, wherein the processing system is further programmed to estimate the occupancy of the enclosure based at least in part on the readings from the sensor.
8. The system of claim 7, further comprising a model of occupancy patterns.
9. The system of claim 8, further comprising: an occupancy prediction process programmed to predict future occupancy of the enclosure based at least in part on the model of occupancy patterns and the occupancy estimated by the processing system.
10. A method for detecting occupancy of an enclosure comprising: monitoring utility information for the enclosure, wherein the utility information comprises a measure of electrical power used within the enclosure; analyzing the utility information monitored by the sensing system to filter a main power line and thereby detect the use of one or more electronic devices; determining whether the use of the one or more electronic devices detected from filtering the main power line indicates a likelihood of current occupancy of the enclosure by one or more humans; estimating a probability of occupancy of the enclosure by one or more humans based at least in part on: the likelihood of current occupancy indicated by the use of the one or more electronic devices detected from filtering the main power line; and a historical probability distribution of occupancy that is fitted using previously detected departure and arrival times; and causing a home system to operate based on the estimate of the probability.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the utility information comprises power line information.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the power line information is filtered to detect the use of the electronic devices.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein the utility information is obtained from a Smart Meter.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein pattern recognition is used by the processing system to monitor changes in the utility information from a baseline to detect the use of the one or more electronic devices.
15. The method of claim 10, wherein the utility information further comprises a Wi-Fi signal that is monitored.
16. A non-transitory storage medium comprising instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform operations comprising: monitoring utility information for the enclosure, wherein the utility information comprises a measure of electrical power used within the enclosure; analyzing the utility information monitored by the sensing system to filter a main power line and thereby detect the use of one or more electronic devices; determining whether the use of the one or more electronic devices detected from filtering the main power line indicates a likelihood of current occupancy of the enclosure by one or more humans; estimating a probability of occupancy of the enclosure by one or more humans based at least in part on: the likelihood of current occupancy indicated by the use of the one or more electronic devices detected from filtering the main power line; and a historical probability distribution of occupancy that is fitted using previously detected departure and arrival times; and causing a home system to operate based on the estimate of the probability.
17. The non-transitory storage medium of claim 16, wherein the utility information comprises power line information.
18. The non-transitory storage medium of claim 17, wherein the power line information is filtered to detect the use of the electronic devices.
19. The non-transitory storage medium of claim 16, wherein the utility information is obtained from a Smart Meter.
20. The non-transitory storage medium of claim 19, wherein pattern recognition is used by the processing system to monitor changes in the utility information from a baseline to detect the use of the one or more electronic devices.
