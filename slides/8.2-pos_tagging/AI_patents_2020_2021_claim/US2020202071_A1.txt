<title>
CONTENT SCORING
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a system and method for verification scoring and/or automated fact checking. More particularly, the present invention relates to automated content scoring based upon an ensemble of algorithms and/or automated fact checking, for example in relation to online journalistic articles, user generated content, blog posts, and user generated comments. Aspects and/or embodiments seek to provide a method of generating a content score for journalistic and other media content, provided with clear protocols and schemata in place and a verifiable method for the reasoning behind the score for such content.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of determining a score indicative of the factual accuracy of information, comprising the steps of: receiving input data from a network of users, the input data comprising metadata, textual content and/or video content; providing to the network of users one or more elements of reference data; performing an algorithmic analysis of the received input data in relation to the reference data; and determining a probabilistic content score based on the algorithmic analysis, wherein the probabilistic content score reflects a verified confidence measure for the input data.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising the step of: automatically detecting the input data as misleading content based on the algorithmic analysis, wherein the misleading content is verified by the probabilistic content score.
3. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising the step of: identifying one or more individual claims within the input data, wherein each individual claim is operable to receive a separate content score.
4. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the algorithmic analysis is performed using the metadata associated with the input data.
5. The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the metadata comprises one or more of: a profile of one or more users; one or more authors; a location; and/or professional details regarding one or more authors and/or one or more publishing bodies.
6. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the algorithmic analysis comprises any one or more of: Reviewing known measures of journalistic quality; reviewing one or more headlines in relation to the input data; reviewing the source of the input data; reviewing the relationship between the source of the input data and one or more users; reviewing the domain from which the input data is received, in particular autobiographical data obtained from the domain; reviewing the format of the input data; reviewing one or more previously obtained probabilistic content scores in relation to one or more professional details regarding one or more authors and/or one or more publishing bodies and/or one or more users; considering the content density of the input data; considering the presence of hyperbole and/or propaganda and/or bias within the input data; evaluating the number of claims referenced within the input data, particularly the proportion of verified and unverified claims; and/or examining linguistic cues within the input data as part of a natural language processing (NLP) computational stage.
7. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising stance detection in relation to the input data.
8. The method as claimed in claim 7, wherein the stance detection comprises analysing data from a plurality of trusted sources: optionally wherein the data from a plurality of trusted sources relates to the same and/or related subject matter as the input data; and/or further optionally wherein the data from a plurality of trusted sources comprises crowdsourced data.
9. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the reference data is selected from a database: optionally wherein the database is stored in one or more computational clouds.
10. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of determining the probabilistic content score based on the algorithmic analysis comprises assigning one or more adjustable weights to the input data.
11. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising the step of: generating an overlay in relation the input data, the overlay comprising one or more content scores in relation to the input data.
12. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising the step of: compiling a plurality of content scores into a truth score.
13. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising the step of: compiling a plurality of content scores and/or truth scores into a credibility index.
14. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising the step of: providing the probabilistic content score to a search engine and/or a news feed, wherein the probabilistic content score is used to rank results delivered by the search engine and/or the news feed.
15. The method as claimed in claim 14, further comprising the step of: providing the truth score to the search engine and/or the news feed, wherein the truth score is used to rank results delivered by the search engine and/or the news feed.
16. The method as claimed in claim 15, further comprising the step of: providing the credibility index to the search engine and/or the news feed, wherein the credibility index is used to rank results delivered by the search engine and/or the news feed.
17. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a step of: manually determining and/or verifying the probabilistic content score, wherein the manual determination and/or verification is provided via a user interface.
18. The method as claimed in claim 17, wherein the user interface is provided by an annotation tool: optionally wherein the user interface provides the one or more users a platform for any one or more of: manually assigning a probabilistic content score; manually adjusting the one or more adjustable weights in relation to the input data; detecting assertions, rumours and/or claims; helping find reference sources against which to fact-check; assisting to determine one or more viewpoints within the textual content and/or video content; assessing the provenance of the one or more headlines in relation to the input data; and/or assisting with a semi-automated probabilistic content scoring procedure; and/or further optionally wherein the user interface carries out an onboarding process for the one or more users, develop reputation points for effectively moderating textual and/or video content and assigning and/or verifying the probabilistic content score.
