MOBILE TERMINAL AND METHOD OF OPERATING THE SAME
</title>

<abstract>
A terminal includes a memory configured to store voice data and a processor configured to measure reliability of learnable data stored in the memory, to classify the learnable data into learning data or adaptive data according to the measured reliability, to generate a learning model by performing unsupervised learning with respect to the learning data, to generate an adaptive model using the adaptive data, and to evaluate recognition performance of each of the learning model and the adaptive model.
