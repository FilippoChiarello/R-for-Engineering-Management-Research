METHOD FOR CONTROLLING CAMERA EXPOSURE TO AUGMENT A WIPER SYSTEM OF A SENSOR ENCLOSURE
</title>

<abstract>
A computer implemented method for controlling camera exposure to augment a wiper system of a sensor enclosure. The computer implemented method can detect a presence of a wiper in one or more images captured by one or more cameras. An exposure time of the one or more cameras can be adjusted. Wiper speed can be adjusted such that wipers move in and out of one or more field of views of the one or more cameras while the one or more cameras are capturing images.

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method for controlling camera exposure to augment a wiper system of a sensor enclosure, the method comprising: detecting a presence of a wiper in one or more images captured by one or more cameras; adjusting an exposure time of the one or more cameras; and adjusting wiper speed such that wipers move in and out of one or more field of views of the one or more cameras while the one or more cameras are capturing images.
2. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the adjusting the exposure time of the one or more cameras comprises: increasing the exposure time of the one or more cameras.
3. The computer implemented method of claim 2, wherein the increasing the exposure time of the one or more cameras comprises: decreasing shutter speeds of the one or more cameras.
4. The computer implemented method of claim 2, wherein the increasing the exposure time of the one or more cameras further comprises: decreasing ISO settings of the one or more cameras.
5. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the adjusting wiper speed such that wipers move in and out of one or more field of views of the one or more cameras comprises: increasing the wiper speed of the wipers.
6. The computer implemented method of claim 1, the method further comprising: capturing images based on the adjusted exposure time and the adjusted wiper speed; and processing the captured images, using at least one processing technique, to reduce motion blur.
7. The computer implemented method of claim 6, wherein the at least one processing technique includes one of image processing or machine learning technique.
8. The computer implemented method of claim 7, wherein the image processing technique includes using one of Lucy-Richardson or Wiener deconvolution technique.
9. The computer implemented method of claim 7, wherein the machine learning technique includes using a convolutional neural network.
10. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the wipers comprise three wipers offset to +/−120 degrees from one another.
11. A sensor enclosure, the sensor comprising: a cover; and a based encased by the cover, the base includes a wiper system to remove moisture and debris from the cover, the wiper system configured to perform: detecting a presence of a wiper in one or more images captured by one or more cameras anchored to the base; adjusting an exposure time of the one or more cameras; and adjusting wiper speed such that wipers of the wiper system move in and out of one or more field of views of the one or more cameras while the one or more cameras are capturing images.
12. The sensor enclosure of claim 11, wherein , wherein the adjusting the exposure time of the one or more cameras comprises: increasing the exposure time of the one or more cameras.
13. The sensor enclosure of claim 12, wherein the increasing the exposure time of the one or more cameras comprises: decreasing shutter speeds of the one or more cameras.
14. The sensor enclosure of claim 12, wherein the increasing the exposure time of the one or more cameras further comprises: decreasing ISO settings of the one or more cameras.
15. The sensor enclosure of claim 11, wherein the adjusting wiper speed such that wipers move in and out of one or more field of views of the one or more cameras: increasing the wiper speed of the wipers.
16. The sensor enclosure of claim 11, the wiper system configured to further perform: capturing images based on the adjusted exposure time and the adjusted wiper speed; and processing the captured images, using at least one processing technique, to reduce motion blur.
17. The sensor enclosure of claim 16, wherein the determining, based on the camera operating information, the one or more camera transitioned from the exposure mode into the integration mode comprises: determining the one or more cameras are not actively capturing image data.
18. The sensor enclosure of claim 17, wherein the image processing technique includes using one of Lucy-Richardson or Wiener deconvolution technique.
19. The sensor enclosure of claim 17, wherein the machine learning technique includes using a convolutional neural network.
20. The sensor enclosure of claim 11, wherein the wiper system comprises three wipers offset to +/−120 degrees from one another.
