<title>
AUTOMATED EXTRACTION OF PERFORMANCE SEGMENTS AND METADATA VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERFORMANCE SEGMENTS FROM CONTRACT DOCUMENTS
</title>

<abstract>
A data processing system for extracting metadata values is described. The data processing system comprises an input unit and a processor communicably coupled to the input unit. The input unit is configured to receive a contract document. The processor is configured to extract at least one segment from the contract document and identify a type of the at least one segment. The processor is further configured to extract at least one metadata value from the at least one segment based on a model, wherein the model is determined based on the identified type of the at least one segment.

<claims>
I/We claim:
1. A data processing system comprising: an input unit configured to receive a contract document; and a processor communicably coupled to the input unit, the processor configured to: extract at least one segment from the contract document; identify a type of the at least one segment; and extract at least one metadata value from the at least one segment based on a model, wherein the model is determined based on the identified type of the at least one segment.
2. The data processing system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the model is a machine learning model and further wherein the processor is configured to determine the machine learning model based on a combination of a metadata associated with the at least one metadata value and the identified type of the at least one segment.
3. The data processing system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to validate the identified type of the at least one segment using a machine learning engine.
4. The data processing system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: parse the contract document into a plurality of segments prior to the extraction of the at least one segment from the contract document.
5. The data processing system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to determine the type of the at least one segment based on a machine learning model.
6. A method for extraction of a metadata value from a contract document, the method comprising: extracting, by a processor, at least one segment from the contract document; identifying, by the processor, a type of the at least one segment; and extracting, by the processor, at least one metadata value from the at least one segment based on a model, wherein the model is determined based on the identified type of the at least one segment.
7. The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the model is a machine learning model and further wherein the machine learning model is determined based on a combination of a metadata associated with the at least one metadata value and the identified type of the at least one segment.
8. The method as claimed in claim 6, further comprising: validating, by the processor, the identified type of the at least one segment using a rule-based engine.
9. The method as claimed in claim 6, further comprising: parsing, by the processor, the contract document into a plurality of segments prior to the extraction of the at least one segment from the contract document.
10. The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the type of the at least one segment is identified based on a machine learning model.
