DATA TRANSMISSION
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus, method and computer program product for: receiving information relating to data consumption characteristics of at least one user device, predicting, based on the received information, at least one data consumption area at a first point in time, determining one or more data transmission modes based on the received information and the predicted at least one data consumption area and instructing at least one communication network element to provide data transmission at the first point in time according to the determined data transmission mode.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An apparatus comprising at least one processor and at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to with the at least one processor, cause the apparatus at least to: receive information relating to data consumption characteristics of at least one user device; predict, based on the received information, at least one data consumption area at a first point in time; determine one or more data transmission modes based on the received information and the predicted at least one data consumption area; and instruct at least one communication network element to provide data transmission at the first point in time according to the determined data transmission mode.
2. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the data consumption characteristics comprise one or more user groups with which the at least one user device is associated.
3. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the apparatus is further configured to associate the at least one user device with one or more user groups based on the received information.
4. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the data consumption characteristics comprise one or more previous locations of the at least one user device.
5. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the apparatus is configured determine one or more communication network elements associated with the at least one predicted data consumption area.
6. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the apparatus is configured to receive information on one or more transmission events scheduled to occur at the first point in time.
7. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the data transmission mode comprises at least one of multicast transmission, unicast transmission, anycast transmission or broadcast transmission.
8. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the apparatus is configured to send user group configuration information to the at least one user device.
9. The apparatus according to claim 6, wherein the apparatus is configured to determine user group configuration information based on the received information on the one or more transmission events.
10. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the apparatus is configured to combine a plurality of predictions of the at least one data consumption area at a second point in time.
11. An apparatus comprising at least one processor and at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to with the at least one processor, cause the apparatus to at least to perform: determine data consumption characteristics of a user of the apparatus; associate the apparatus with at least one user group based on the data consumption characteristics; and inform a server device about the at least one user group with which the apparatus is associated.
12. The apparatus according to claim 11, wherein the data consumption characteristics comprise at least one of the following: search history, content consumption history, location history, estimated personal interest or personal details of a user of the apparatus.
13. The apparatus according to claim 11, wherein the apparatus is a mobile computing device.
14. A method comprising: receiving information relating to data consumption characteristics of at least one user device; predicting, based on the received information, at least one data consumption area at a first point in time; determining one or more data transmission modes based on the received information and the predicted at least one data consumption area; and instructing at least one communication network element to provide data transmission at the first point in time according to the determined data transmission mode.
15. The method according to claim 14, wherein the data consumption characteristics comprise one or more user groups with which the at least one user device is associated.
16. The method according to claim 14, further comprising; associating the at least one user device with one or more user groups based on the received information.
17. The method according to claim 14, wherein the data consumption characteristics comprise one or more previous locations of the at least one user device.
18. The method according to claim 14, further comprising: determining one or more communication network elements associated with the at least one predicted data consumption area.
19. The method according to claim 14, wherein the apparatus is configured to receive information on one or more transmission events scheduled to occur at the first point in time.
20. The method according to claim 14, wherein the data transmission mode comprises at least one of multicast transmission, unicast transmission, anycast transmission or broadcast transmission.
