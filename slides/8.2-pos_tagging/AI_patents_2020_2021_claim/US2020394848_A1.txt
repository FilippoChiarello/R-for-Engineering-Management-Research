<title>
SCALABLE THREE-DIMENSIONAL OBJECT RECOGNITION IN A CROSS REALITY SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for scalable three-dimensional (3-D) object recognition in a cross reality system. One of the methods includes maintaining object data specifying objects that have been recognized in a scene. A stream of input images of the scene is received, including a stream of color images and a stream of depth images. A color image is provided as input to an object recognition system. A recognition output that identifies a respective object mask for each object in the color image is received. A synchronization system determines a corresponding depth image for the color image. A 3-D bounding box generation system determines a respective 3-D bounding box for each object that has been recognized in the color image. Data specifying one or more 3-D bounding boxes is received as output from the 3-D bounding box generation system.
