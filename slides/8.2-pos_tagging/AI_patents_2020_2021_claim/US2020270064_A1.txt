<title>
GRAIN STORAGE AND PROCESSING FACILITY HAVING AN OTPICAL SENSING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A grain facility has a grain receiving station and a grain transport line with a grain elevator, a distributor with at least one input spout, and at least one grain bin. The grain transport line moves grain from the grain receiving station to one of the at least one grain bins and the distributor directs the grain to a selected bin of the at least one grain bin. The grain facility further includes an optical sensing system having at least one optical sensor positioned in the grain transport line at or before the distributor, wherein the optical sensing system senses the type of grain in the grain transport line. A control system determines if the grain passing through the grain transport line is suitable for the selected grain bin and produces an alarm if the grain in the grain transport line is not suitable for the selected grain bin.

<claims>
1. A grain storage and processing facility having a grain receiving station and a grain transport line comprising a grain elevator, a distributor with at least one input spout, and at least one grain bin, wherein the grain transport line moves grain from the grain receiving station to one of the at least one grain bins and the distributor directs the grain to a selected bin of the at least one grain bin; the grain storage and processing facility further comprising: an optical sensing system having at least one optical sensor positioned in the grain transport line at or before the distributor, wherein the optical sensing system senses the type of grain in the grain transport line; and a control system that determines if the grain passing through the grain transport line is suitable for the selected grain bin and produces an alarm if the grain in the grain transport line is not suitable for the selected grain bin.
2. The grain storage and processing facility of claim 1 wherein the grain elevator conveys the grain in a direction having a vertical component to change the elevation of the grain.
3. The grain storage and processing facility of claim 2 wherein the grain elevator comprises a bucket conveyor having a plurality of buckets.
4. The grain storage and processing facility of claim 1 wherein the optical sensing system is placed at the grain receiving station.
5. The grain storage and processing facility of claim 1 wherein the optical sensor has a transparent window that is operatively in contact with the grain to be identified in the grain transport line, wherein the transparent window is made of sapphire, aluminum oxynitride or magnesium aluminate.
6. The grain storage and processing facility of claim 5 wherein as the grain passes the transport window, the optical sensing system sends a signal to the control system.
7. The grain storage and processing facility of claim 1 wherein the control system stores the type of grain in each of the at least one grain bins and compares the type of grain detected in the grain transport line with the type of grain in the at least one grain bin that has been selected to receive the grain.
8. The grain storage and processing facility of claim 1 wherein the alarm is an audible alarm.
9. The grain storage and processing facility of claim 1 wherein the alarm is a visual alarm.
10. The grain storage and processing facility of claim 1 wherein the control system automatically stops the grain elevator if the grain in the grain transport line is not suitable for the selected grain bin.
