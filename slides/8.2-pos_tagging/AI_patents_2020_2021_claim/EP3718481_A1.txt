IMAGING SUPPORT APPARATUS, METHOD, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
An abnormal site detection unit detects an abnormal site included in a medical image acquired based on radiation transmitted through a subject. A position specifying unit generates positional information for specifying a position of the abnormal site based on a feature point of the subject included in the medical image in a case where the abnormal site is detected in the medical image. An information generation unit generates additional imaging instruction information, including information that indicates a type of additional imaging based on the abnormal site and information that indicates the position of the abnormal site based on the positional information, for instructing at least one additional imaging.

<claims>
1. An imaging support apparatus comprising: an abnormal site detection unit that detects an abnormal site included in a medical image acquired based on radiation transmitted through a subject; a position specifying unit that generates positional information for specifying a position of the abnormal site based on a feature point of the subject included in the medical image in a case where the abnormal site is detected in the medical image; and an information generation unit that generates additional imaging instruction information, including information that indicates a type of additional imaging based on the abnormal site and information that indicates the position of the abnormal site based on the positional information, for instructing at least one additional imaging.
2. The imaging support apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising:
a determination unit that determines whether the position of the abnormal site is included in a prior image acquired by prior imaging before the additional imaging based on the positional information and the prior image in a case where the additional imaging is performed, and determines whether the position of the abnormal site is included in an imaging available region of the at least one additional imaging based on a result of the determination.
3. The imaging support apparatus according to claim 2,
wherein in a case where the additional imaging instruction information is for instructing additional imaging of plural times, the determination unit determines whether the position of the abnormal site is included in each imaging available region of the additional imaging of plural times.
4. The imaging support apparatus according to claim 2 or 3,
wherein the prior image is an optical image representing a surface of the subject.
5. The imaging support apparatus according to claim 2 or 3,
wherein the prior image is a pre-image acquired by irradiating the subject with the radiation before the additional imaging.
6. The imaging support apparatus according to any one of claims 2 to 5, further comprising:
a warning unit that issues a warning in a case where the position of the abnormal site is not included in the imaging available region of the at least one additional imaging.
7. The imaging support apparatus according to any one of claims 2 to 6, further comprising:
a positioning information output unit that outputs positioning information for positioning the abnormal site in the imaging available region in a case where the position of the abnormal site is not included in the imaging available region of the at least one additional imaging.
8. The imaging support apparatus according to any one of claims 2 to 7, further comprising: a light source that emits light toward the subject; a light source driving unit that drives the light source so that the position of the abnormal site in the surface of the subject is irradiated with light emitted from the light source; and a light source control unit that controls driving of the light source driving unit based on the result of the determination by the determination unit.
9. The imaging support apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
wherein the subject is a breast.
10. The imaging support apparatus according to claim 9,
wherein the position specifying unit generates the positional information for specifying the position of the abnormal site by detecting a nipple position of the breast and at least two positions on at least one of a skin line or a chest wall as the feature point.
11. The imaging support apparatus according to claim 9 or 10,
wherein the information generation unit generates the additional imaging instruction information including compression plate information indicating a type of a compression plate that compresses the breast.
12. The imaging support apparatus according to claim 11, further comprising:
a compression plate warning unit that issues a warning in a case where a compression plate used for the additional imaging is different from the compression plate indicated by the compression plate information.
13. An imaging support method comprising: detecting an abnormal site included in a medical image acquired based on radiation transmitted through a subject; generating positional information for specifying a position of the abnormal site based on a feature point of the subject included in the medical image in a case where the abnormal site is detected in the medical image; and generating additional imaging instruction information, including information that indicates a type of additional imaging based on the abnormal site and information that indicates the position of the abnormal site based on the positional information, for instructing at least one additional imaging.
14. A computer-readable storage medium that stores an imaging support program that causes a computer to execute: a step of detecting an abnormal site included in a medical image acquired based on radiation transmitted through a subject; a step of generating positional information for specifying a position of the abnormal site based on a feature point of the subject included in the medical image in a case where the abnormal site is detected in the medical image; and a step of generating additional imaging instruction information, including information that indicates a type of additional imaging based on the abnormal site and information that indicates the position of the abnormal site based on the positional information, for instructing at least one additional imaging.
