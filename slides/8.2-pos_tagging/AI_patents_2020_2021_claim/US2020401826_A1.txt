TRAINING A MACHINE TO RECOGNIZE A MOTOR VEHICLE DRIVER USING A MOBILE DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
Determining that a motor vehicle driver is using a mobile device while driving a motor vehicle. Multiple images of a driver of a motor vehicle are captured through a side window of the motor vehicle. Positive images show a driver using a mobile device while driving a motor vehicle. Negative images show a driver not using a mobile device while driving a motor vehicle. Multiple training images are selected from both the positive images and the negative images. The selected training images and respective labels, indicating that the selected training images are positive images or negative images, are input to a machine (e.g. Convolutional Neural Network, (CNN)). The CNN is trained to classify that a test image, captured through a side window of a motor vehicle, shows a driver using a mobile device while driving the motor vehicle.
