METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR NEUROLOGICAL EVENT DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
A method for neurological event detection is provided and include: obtaining a neural oscillation signal and extracting a plurality of features from the neural oscillation signal; obtaining a plurality of classification results corresponding to a plurality of times according to the plurality of features by using a classification model constructed based on a plurality of training data, wherein whether a neurological event occurs is known in each training data; and calculating a final determination result corresponding to each of a plurality of evaluation time windows according to a preset time window width and the plurality of classification results and displaying the final determination result. The final determination result indicates whether the neurological event occurs. Each evaluation time window corresponds to a plurality of classification results and one single final determination result. In addition, a neurological event detection system using the method for neurological event detection is also provided.
