ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ELECTRONIC DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is an artificial intelligence electronic device including an input unit configured to receive speech input from a user, a communication unit configured to communicate with a plurality of other artificial intelligence electronic devices, and a processor configured to determine a device which will perform a function corresponding to the speech input, when the artificial intelligence electronic device and one or more other artificial intelligence electronic devices receive the speech input, and perform the function corresponding to the speech input when the device which will perform the function corresponding to the speech input is the artificial intelligence electronic device.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An artificial intelligence electronic device comprising: an input interface configured to receive speech input from a user; a communicator configured to communicate with a plurality of other artificial intelligence electronic devices; and a processor configured to: determine a device which will perform a function corresponding to the speech input, when the artificial intelligence electronic device and one or more other artificial intelligence electronic devices receive the speech input, and perform the function corresponding to the speech input when the device which will perform the function corresponding to the speech input is the artificial intelligence electronic device.
2. The artificial intelligence electronic device of claim 1, wherein the processor acquires an intent corresponding to the speech input using the speech input, and determines the device which will perform the function corresponding to the speech input based on the intent and "role set in each of the artificial intelligence electronic device and the one or more other artificial intelligence electronic devices".
3. The artificial intelligence electronic device of claim 2, wherein the role includes a common role commonly assigned to the plurality of artificial intelligence electronic devices and a unique role solely assigned to one of the plurality of artificial intelligence electronic devices.
4. The artificial intelligence electronic device of claim 3, wherein the common role and the unique role are set in each of the plurality of electronic devices based on usage histories of the plurality of electronic devices.
5. The artificial intelligence electronic device of claim 3, wherein the processor determines the artificial intelligence electronic device as the device which will perform the function corresponding to the speech input, when the intent corresponds to the unique role of the artificial intelligence electronic device.
6. The artificial intelligence electronic device of claim 3, wherein the processor determines the device which will perform the function corresponding to the speech input from among the artificial intelligence electronic device and the one or more other artificial intelligence electronic devices, when the intent corresponds to the common role, and performs the function corresponding to the speech input when the device which will perform the function corresponding to the speech input is the artificial intelligence electronic device.
7. The artificial intelligence electronic device of claim 6, wherein the processor determines, as the device which will perform the function corresponding to the speech input, a device closest to the user among the artificial intelligence electronic device and the one or more other artificial intelligence electronic devices, when the intent corresponds to the common role, and performs the function corresponding to the speech input when the artificial intelligence electronic device is closest to the user.
8. The artificial intelligence electronic device of claim 2, wherein the processor transmits a function performing command to a second artificial intelligence electronic device, when the device which will perform the function corresponding to the speech input is the second artificial intelligence electronic device among the artificial intelligence electronic device and the one or more other artificial intelligence electronic devices.
9. The artificial intelligence electronic device of claim 8, wherein the processor determines, as the device which will perform the function corresponding to the speech input, the second artificial intelligence electronic device closest to the user among the artificial intelligence electronic device and the one or more other artificial intelligence electronic devices, when the intent corresponds to the common role, and transmits a function performing command to the second artificial intelligence electronic device.
10. The artificial intelligence electronic device of claim 8, wherein the processor determines the second artificial intelligence electronic device as the device which will perform the function corresponding to the speech input, when the intent corresponds to a unique role of the second artificial intelligence electronic device, and transmits a function performing command to the second artificial intelligence electronic device.
11. The artificial intelligence electronic device of claim 2, wherein the processor transmits the intent or the speech input to a third artificial intelligence electronic device, when the intent corresponds to a unique role of the third artificial intelligence electronic device which has not received the speech input.
12. The artificial intelligence electronic device of claim 2, wherein the processor: receives speech input reception information from the one or more other artificial intelligence electronic devices and determines a device which will acquire the intent from among the artificial intelligence electronic device and the one or more other artificial intelligence electronic devices, and acquires the intent when the device which will acquire the intent is the artificial intelligence electronic device.
13. The artificial intelligence electronic device of claim 2, wherein the processor acquires the intent when a device selection command is received from another artificial intelligence electronic device.
