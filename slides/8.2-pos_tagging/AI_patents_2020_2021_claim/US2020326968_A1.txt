DEVICE SECURITY ACROSS MULTIPLE OPERATING SYSTEM MODALITIES
</title>

<abstract>
Device security across multiple operating system modalities may include allocating, by a hypervisor, to a first virtual machine comprising a first operating system of a first modality, based on the first modality, a first one or more access privileges to one or more resources; and allocating, by the hypervisor, to a second virtual machine comprising a second operating system of a second modality, based on the second modality, a second one or more access privileges to the one or more resources.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for device security across multiple operating system modalities comprising: allocating, by a hypervisor, to a first virtual machine comprising a first operating system of a first modality, based on the first modality, a first one or more access privileges to one or more resources; and allocating, by the hypervisor, to a second virtual machine comprising a second operating system of a second modality, based on the second modality, a second one or more access privileges to the one or more resources.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more resources comprise one or more devices.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising modifying, by the hypervisor, the second one or more access privileges based on a state of the first virtual machine.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the first operating system comprises a formally verified operating system and the second operating system comprises an unverified operating system.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising passing, by the first virtual machine to the second virtual machine, one or more data values associated with the one or more resources.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the hypervisor, the first virtual machine, and the second virtual machine are implemented by an autonomous vehicle.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising modifying, by the hypervisor, the second one or more access privileges based on a change in a state of the autonomous vehicle.
8. The method vehicle of claim 7, wherein the change in the state of the autonomous vehicle comprises receiving a command to disable or enable one or more functions of the autonomous vehicle, or the autonomous vehicle entering one or more of: an autonomous driving mode, a potentially autonomous driving mode, or a stationary mode.
9. An apparatus for device security across multiple operating system modalities, the apparatus configured to perform steps comprising: allocating, by a hypervisor, to a first virtual machine comprising a first operating system of a first modality, based on the first modality, a first one or more access privileges to one or more resources; and allocating, by the hypervisor, to a second virtual machine comprising a second operating system of a second modality, based on the second modality, a second one or more access privileges to the one or more resources.
10. The apparatus of claim 9, wherein the one or more resources comprise one or more devices.
11. The apparatus of claim 9, wherein the steps further comprise modifying, by the hypervisor, the second one or more access privileges based on a state of the first virtual machine.
12. The apparatus of claim 9, wherein the first operating system comprises a formally verified operating system and the second operating system comprises an unverified operating system.
13. The apparatus of claim 9, wherein the steps further comprise passing, by the first virtual machine to the second virtual machine, one or more data values associated with the one or more resources.
14. The apparatus of claim 9, wherein the steps further comprise modifying, by the hypervisor, the second one or more access privileges based on a change in in a state of an autonomous vehicle.
15. The apparatus of claim 14, wherein the change in the state of the autonomous vehicle comprises receiving a command to disable or enable one or more functions of the autonomous vehicle, or the autonomous vehicle entering one or more of: an autonomous driving mode, a potentially autonomous driving mode, or a stationary mode.
16. An autonomous vehicle configured device security across multiple operating system modalities, the autonomous vehicle comprising an apparatus configured to perform steps comprising: allocating, by a hypervisor, to a first virtual machine comprising a first operating system of a first modality, based on the first modality, a first one or more access privileges to one or more resources; and allocating, by the hypervisor, to a second virtual machine comprising a second operating system of a second modality, based on the second modality, a second one or more access privileges to the one or more resources.
17. The apparatus of claim 16, wherein the one or more resources comprise one or more devices.
18. The autonomous vehicle of claim 16, wherein the steps further comprise modifying, by the hypervisor, the second one or more access privileges based on a state of the first virtual machine.
19. The autonomous vehicle of claim 16, wherein the steps further comprise modifying, by the hypervisor, the second one or more access privileges based on a change in in a state of an autonomous vehicle.
20. A computer program product disposed upon a non-transitory computer readable medium, the computer program product comprising computer program instructions for device security across multiple operating system modalities that, when executed, cause a computer system to carry out the steps of: allocating, by a hypervisor, to a first virtual machine comprising a first operating system of a first modality, based on the first modality, a first one or more access privileges to one or more resources; and allocating, by the hypervisor, to a second virtual machine comprising a second operating system of a second modality, based on the second modality, a second one or more access privileges to the one or more resources.
