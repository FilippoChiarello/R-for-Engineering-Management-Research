INFORMATION PROCESSING APPARATUS, SYSTEM, METHOD FOR CONTROLLING INFORMATION PROCESSING APPARATUS, AND COMPUTER PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
An information processing apparatus and method is provided and controls execution of learning processing thereon. Learning data are generated in which readings of a human presence sensor serve as input values, information on receiving or not receiving any operation from an operation panel serves as success/failure flags. The success/failure flag is generated from an assessment result of a current resumption assessment model and the information on receiving or not receiving an operation, and is provided to the learning data. Accordingly, learning processing is performed using the success/failure flags provided in the learning data, thereby efficiently implementing learning.

<claims>
1. An information processing apparatus comprising: a sensor; an operation unit; an assessment unit configured to use a machine learning model to, based on a sensor reading acquired from the sensor, assess whether to change a power control state of the information processing apparatus; an acquisition unit configured to acquire operation information from the operation unit; a generation unit configured to, from an assessment result output by the assessment unit and the operation information acquired by the acquisition unit, generate success/failure information on the assessment result and provide the success/failure information to learning data; a storage unit configured to store therein the learning data, each piece of which is composed at least of the sensor reading, the operation information, and the success/failure information; and a determination unit configured to, in a case where the pieces of learning data that have the success/failure information provided therein satisfy a certain condition, determine that learning of the machine learning model using the pieces of learning data be executed.
2. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein, when the stored learning data contain a predetermined number or more of pieces of learning data in which the success/failure information indicating failure is provided, the determination unit determines that the learning be executed.
3. The information processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the predetermined number changes along with elapsed time since installation of the information processing apparatus.
4. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the power control state is a first power control state, or a second power control state in which power consumption is smaller than in the first power control state, and wherein the operation information is information on receiving or not receiving any operation from the operation panel.
5. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the generation unit generates the success/failure information in which the success/failure information is labeled as success when a combination of the assessment result from the assessment unit and the operation information is identical with a predetermined combination and the success/failure information is labeled as failure when the combination is different from the predetermined combination.
6. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the information processing apparatus updates the success/failure information in the learning data using the assessment unit after learning processing.
7. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the machine learning model that is used by the assessment unit is a recurrent neural network.
8. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the information processing apparatus is an image processing apparatus.
9. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a learning processing unit configured to execute learning of the machine learning model using the learning data; and an updating unit configured to update the machine learning model.
10. A method for controlling an information processing apparatus that includes a storage unit, a sensor and an operation unit, the method comprising: using a machine learning model to, based on a sensor reading acquired from the sensor, assess whether to change a power control state of the information processing apparatus; acquiring operation information from the operation unit; generating, based on an assessment result output by the assessment unit and the operation information acquired by the acquisition unit, success/failure information on the assessment result and providing the success/failure information to learning data; storing the learning data, each piece of which is composed at least of the sensor reading, the operation information, and the success/failure information, in the storage unit; and in a case where the piece of learning data that has the success/failure information provided therein satisfies a certain condition, determining that learning of the machine learning model using the piece of learning data be executed.
