SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ENRICHING CONSUMER MANAGEMENT RECORDS USING HASHED MOBILE SIGNALING DATA
</title>

<abstract>
A system is disclosed for sharing of encrypted personal identification information in such a way so as to maintain user privacy. In examples, the present system includes an onsite wireless device, an onsite wireless sensor, a remote event detection server, and a remote content database. The remote event detection server has an event detection engine based on certain signaling (or triggering) events within the wireless data network. The remote event detection server is connected to the remote content database that contains other ephemeral information related to a customer or subscriber (characteristics of browsers used, browsing history, login IDs, etc.). When a customer bearing a wireless device nears the wireless sensor, their presence triggers an event that is registered by the mobile network and detected by the event detection server. The event detection server registers this event and customer information in the remote content database using methods disclosed herein to maintain anonymity and privacy.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method of generating stored unique personal genome records, comprising: (a) receiving personal identification information (PII) data regarding a user of a mobile device; (b) encoding the PII data into encoded PII data; (c) detecting the presence of the mobile device with a sensor; (d) receiving the encoded PII upon detecting the presence of the mobile device; and (e) transmitting the encoded PII to an event service.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein said step of encoding the PII data into encoded PII data comprises the step of hashing the PII data.
3. A method of generating stored unique personal genome records, comprising: (a) receiving personal identification information (PII) data regarding a user of a mobile device; (b) detecting the presence of the mobile device with a sensor; (c) receiving the PII upon detecting the presence of the mobile device (d) encoding the PII data into encoded PII data; and (e) transmitting the encoded PII to an event service.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein detection events represent the detection of a particular user device by an RF sensor device and at a known location.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the detection events persist or consecutively repeat as long as the mobile device remains detectable by the RF sensor.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the persistence or consecutive repeating of the detection event can be used to infer the presence of a human owner of the device within range of the sensor.
7. The method of claim 3, wherein the mobile device is represented using the same hashed ID regardless of which RF device it is sensed by, provided the RF devices belong to the same underlying wireless carrier.
8. One or more processor readable storage devices having processor readable code embodied on said processor readable storage devices, the processor readable code for programming one or more processors to perform a method comprising: (a) receiving personal identification information (PII) data regarding a user of a mobile device; (b) detecting the presence of the mobile device with a sensor; (c) receiving the PII at a carrier upon detecting the presence of the mobile device; (d) encoding the PII data into encoded PII data; and (e) storing the encoded PII at an event service in a personal genome record, the event service storing unique encoded PII for a plurality of users in a plurality of personal genome records that can be dynamically accessed.
9. The machine-readable storage medium of claim 8, wherein the personal genome records can also be enriched with retail data corresponding to the known users from multiple sources.
10. A method of generating stored unique personal genome records, comprising: (a) receiving personal identification information (PII) data regarding a user of a mobile device; (b) detecting the presence of the mobile device at different times by multiple, carrier-specific RF sensors; (c) receiving, at multiple carriers, the PII upon detecting the presence of the mobile device via their carrier-specific RF sensor (d) encoding, at the multiple carriers, the PII data into encoded PII data; and (e) receiving, from the multiple carriers, the encoded PII data at an event service.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein data from multiple carriers can be aggregated to form a composite assessment of all human users within a coverage area of the multiple RF sensors.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein events from multiple carriers or multiple devices per carrier can be probabilistically or deterministically associated with a single personal genome.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein data associated with browser signatures and usage is associated with the personal genome.
14. The method of claim 12, wherein machine learning algorithms are applied by the event service to form the personal genome.
