<claims>
1. A method of collaborative online shopping comprising: initiating, by a first computing device, an online collaborative event via an application of a remote server, wherein the remote server provides a multimedia sharing environment to the first computing device and other remote computing devices, the multimedia sharing environment enabling real-time synchronized display of data on the first computing device and the other remote computing devices; displaying in response to the initiating, by the first computing device, a collaborative viewing window, a communication tool enabling a first user of the first computing device to selectively communicate with other users of the respective other remote computing devices, and a viewing tool enabling the first user to selectively switch between a plurality of views in the collaborative viewing window, wherein each of the plurality of views are controlled by different ones of the first computing device and the other remote computing devices of the multimedia sharing environment; receiving, by the first computing device, a selection of a first view of the plurality of views, wherein the first view is controlled by one of the other remote computing devices; displaying, by the first computing device, a broadcast of the first view of the one of the other remote computing devices from the remote server in the viewing window in response to the selection of the first view, wherein changes to the first view implemented by the one of the other remote computing devices are displayed in the viewing window in real-time; selective sharing, by the first computing device, account resources of the one of the other remote computing devices with the first user, wherein the account resources are separate from the viewing window and include at least one selected from the group consisting of: virtual shopping carts, shopping lists, wish lists, fitting rooms, user models, products of interest to users bills, audio files and play lists, images, users' ratings, feedback, and user-specified content regarding a product including comments and tags; and initiating, by the first computing device, the communication tool to selectively send a communication to one of the other users of the respective other remote computing devices during the online collaborative event.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the remote server enables multiple modes of operation including an asynchronous mode providing an asynchronous multimedia sharing environment wherein all of the users of the multimedia sharing environment are not required to be online, and a synchronous mode providing a synchronous multimedia sharing environment wherein all of the users of the multimedia sharing environment are required to be online, the method further comprising receiving, by the first computing device, a selection for the synchronous mode.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the multiple modes of operation further include a common mode, wherein data is delivered to the first computing device and the other remote computing devices in a sequence that it is requested from the respective user s of the first computing device and the other remote computing devices.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the comprises browser content of an online shopping session.
5. The method of claim 1, the method further comprising sending, by the first computing device, an invitation to participate in the online collaborative event to the other users via a social network.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising displaying in response to the initiating, by the first computing device, one or more tools selected from the group consisting of: a tool for scheduling a time to go on a collaborative trip online; a tool for proposing locations for group activities including a location of a place of interest that minimizes travel for all the users participating in the online collaborative event; a tool enabling users to organize event, activity, or occasion information including one or more selected from the group consisting of a theme, a location, a venue, map information, participants, attendees, a dress code, news, feeds and articles related to an event, photos, videos and other event related media, user feedback, ratings and comments; a tool enabling users to share an image, a photo, a video, or a 3D character model; a tool enabling suggestions on what to wear for a particular occasion, event, or activity; what to bring to an event, activity, or occasion; and where to buy a product, based on account preferences of users and event, activity, or occasion details; a tool for apparel and venue decorations suggestions for an event, activity, or occasion based on a season, a time of day an event or activity is held, whether an event is indoor or outdoor, and a budget allocated; a tool providing information on restaurants, shopping plazas, movie studios, games, historical sites, museums and other venues; upcoming events and shows, festivals, concerts, and exhibitions; and music bands, groups, or celebrities coming to town based on users' preferences, or proximity of an event; a tool providing weather and traffic updates, and traffic and weather information relevant to a given event, venue, or activity; and a tool enabling users to collaboratively design a room or any space virtually; purchase virtual furniture and decorations; or design, build and buy furniture or other items.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising sending, by the first computing device, an automated invitation message to participate in the online collaborative event to select contacts of a contacts list of the first user based on a selection by the first user of the select contacts.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: playing, by the first computing device, audio data to the first user comprising all audio channels of respective other users participating in the online collaborative event.
