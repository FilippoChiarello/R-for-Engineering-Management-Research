Illumination element receptacle
</title>

<abstract>
Articles of manufacture, systems and methods facilitating light emitting diode (LED) receptacles are provided herein. In one embodiment, an article of manufacture comprises: an inner wall; an outer wall, wherein the inner wall and the outer wall form a double walled receptacle; circuitry disposed between the inner wall and the outer wall, the circuitry comprising at least one light emitting diode; and a control device coupled to the at least one light emitting diode, wherein the control device is configured to control illumination of the at least one light emitting diode.

<claims>
1. A cup for holding fluid, comprising: an inner wall; an outer wall, wherein the inner wall and the outer wall form a double walled receptacle for holding the fluid; circuitry disposed between the inner wall and the outer wall, the circuitry comprising at least one light emitting diode; and a removable portion that is configured to be detachable from the double walled receptacle and electrically decoupled from the circuitry when detached, and is electrically coupled to the circuitry when attached to the receptacle, the removable portion comprising a control device removably coupled to the at least one light emitting diode, wherein the control device is configured to control illumination of the at least one light emitting diode, wherein the removable portion further comprises inner ridge and a sealing material that forms a waterproof seal with the double walled receptacle when the removable portion is attached to the double walled receptacle.
2. The cup for holding fluid of claim 1, further comprises a printed sheet disposed between the inner wall and the outer wall and having the at least one light emitting diode disposed on the printed sheet.
3. The cup for holding fluid of claim 1, wherein the outer wall is at least one of transparent or translucent to display the at least one light emitting diode through the outer wall.
4. The cup for holding fluid of claim 1, wherein the removable portion further comprises a power source coupled to the control device and configured to provide power to the control device and the at least one light emitting diode, wherein the power source is removably coupled to the circuitry, and wherein the power source comprises at least one battery.
5. The cup for holding fluid of claim 4, wherein the at least one battery is coupled to a switch that controls the at least one battery to provide power to the control device and the at least one light emitting diode.
6. The cup for holding fluid of claim 1, further comprising a power connection component coupled to the control device, wherein the power connection component is configured to be removably coupled to a power source external to the article of manufacture to provide power to the control device and the at least one light emitting diode.
7. The cup for holding fluid of claim 1, further comprising at least one other light emitting diode, wherein the control device is configured to output a signal causing the at least one light emitting diode and the at least one other light emitting diode to have staggered illumination, wherein the staggered illumination comprises the at least one light emitting diode commencing illuminating at a first time and the at least one other light emitting diode commencing illumination at a second time, wherein the second time is later than the first time.
8. The cup for holding fluid of claim 7, wherein the control device is configured to output a signal causing the at least one light emitting diode and the at least one other light emitting diode to illuminate.
9. The cup for holding fluid of claim 4, wherein the control device comprises a power shut off component configured to automatically shut off power from the at least one battery.
10. The cup for holding fluid of claim 9, wherein the power shut off component is further configured to automatically shut off power from the at least one battery after a defined amount of time that the at least one battery has provided power to the at least one light emitting diode.
11. The cup for holding fluid of claim 1, wherein the outer wall is comprised of ceramic, plastic or porcelain.
12. The cup for holding fluid of claim 1, further comprising a removable lid covering the double walled receptacle.
13. The cup for holding fluid of claim 1, wherein the sealing material is a silicon ring or a rubber ring.
14. The cup for holding fluid of claim 1, wherein the removable portion is configured to attach to a bottom of the double walled receptacle.
