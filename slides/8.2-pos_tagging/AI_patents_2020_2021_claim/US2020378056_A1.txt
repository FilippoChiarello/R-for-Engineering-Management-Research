METHOD FOR ACTIVELY DECREASING THE TEMPERATURE OF A HEATABLE SOLEPLATE IN A TEXTILE TREATMENT DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a method of operating a textile treatment device comprising a heatable soleplate intended to be in contact with a textile for treating the textile. The method comprises a first step (1001) of setting a first temperature target for the heatable soleplate, and a step (1002) of detecting movement of said textile treatment device. If the step (1002) of 5 detecting movement did not detect any movement of said textile treatment device during more than a given first time duration, a step (1004) of actively decreasing the temperature of the heatable soleplate (4) up to reaching a first given temperature having a value below said first temperature target.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of operating a textile treatment device comprising a heatable soleplate intended to be in contact with a textile for treating the textile, the method comprising: a first step of setting a first temperature target for the heatable soleplate, a step of detecting movement of said textile treatment device, if the step of detecting movement did not detect any movement of said textile treatment device during more than a given first time duration, a step of actively decreasing the temperature of the heatable soleplate up to reaching a first given temperature having a value below said first temperature target.
2. The method according to claim 1, further comprising a step of detecting a classification of the textile being treated, wherein said classification is defined as: a fabric type of the textile, or a fabric level of delicateness for treating the textile.
3. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: if the step of detecting movement did not detect any movement of said textile treatment device during more than a given second time duration, said second time duration being less than said first time duration, a second step of setting a second temperature target for the heatable soleplate, said second temperature target being less than said first temperature target.
4. The method according to claim 2, further comprising a step of associating a value to said first temperature target depending on said classification.
5. The method according to claim 2, further comprising a step of associating a value to said first given temperature depending on said classification and said first temperature target.
6. The method according to claim 2, further comprising a step of associating a value to said first time duration and/or said second time duration, depending on said first temperature target and/or said classification.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein said step of actively decreasing the temperature of the heatable soleplate is performed only if the temperature of the heatable soleplate is above said first given temperature.
8. The method according to claim 1, wherein said step of actively decreasing the temperature of the heatable soleplate comprising injecting an amount of water in a steam chamber being in thermal contact with said heatable soleplate.
9. The method according to claim 8, wherein injecting an amount of water in said steam chamber comprises injecting water with a continuous flow rate.
10. The method according to claim 9, wherein said continuous flow rate has a value between 4-25 g/mn.
11. The method according to claim 8, wherein injecting an amount of water in said steam chamber comprises injecting water with different successive flow rates.
12. The method according to claim 11, wherein said different successive flow rates comprise a first flow rate in the range 2-10 g/mn during a first time duration in the range 20-60 seconds, followed by a second flow rate in the range 5-25 g/mn during a second time duration in the range 10-40 seconds.
13. The method according to claim 1, further comprising a step of passively decreasing the temperature of the heatable soleplate up to reaching a second given temperature having a value less than said first given temperature.
14. The method according to claim 13, further comprising a step of associating a value to said second temperature , said value depending on said classification.
15. A textile treatment device for treating a textile, the textile treatment device comprising: a heatable soleplate intended to be in contact with the textile for treating the textile, a motion sensor for detecting movement of said textile treatment device, means for actively decreasing the temperature of the heatable soleplate a control unit for triggering said means for actively decreasing the temperature of the heatable soleplate if the motion sensor did not detect any movement of said textile treatment device during more than a given first time duration, for actively decreasing the temperature of the heatable soleplate up to reaching a first given temperature having a value below said first temperature target.
16. The textile treatment device according to claim 15, wherein said means for actively decreasing the temperature of the heatable soleplate comprise a steam chamber being in thermal contact with said heatable soleplate a water supply, a pump controllable by said control unit, for pumping water from said water supply into said steam chamber.
17. The textile treatment device according to any one of claims claim 15, further comprising a one-way valve arranged between said water supply and said steam chamber, to prevent back flow of steam when water is injected in said steam chamber.
18. The textile treatment device according to any one of claims claim 15, further comprising an image sensor for taking an image of the textile to be treated, wherein said control unit is adapted to execute an algorithm stored in said textile treatment device, using the taken image as an input of said algorithm, to obtain a classification of the textile, wherein said classification is defined as: a fabric type of the textile, or a fabric level of delicateness for treating the textile.
19. The textile treatment device according to claim 15, wherein the textile treatment device is taken among the set defined by a pressurized steam ironing system with boiler in the base, a pressurized steam ironing system without boiler in the base, a steam ironing device, a stand garment steamer with a steam chamber in the steamer head and a boiler in the base.
20. A computer program product taking the form of an executable file, or an executable library, or a downloadable mobile application for mobile phone and/or smartphone, the computer program product containing instruction codes for implementing the method according to claim 1.
