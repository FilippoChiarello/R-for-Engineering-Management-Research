GRIP WITH ELECTRONIC SYSTEM AND EXTERIOR VENTING
</title>

<abstract>
Grip with electronic system and exterior venting. In an embodiment, the grip comprises a main body comprising a shaft cavity extending from an open first end to a second end. The grip also comprises an end cap that is attached to the second end of the main body. The end cap comprises a base adjacent to the second end of the main body, which comprises one or more vent openings to one or more vent paths. The end cap also comprises a side wall extending from the base and defining an interior cavity. The end cap further comprises one or more vent paths. Each vent path provides fluid communication between at least one of the vent opening(s) and at least one of one or more vent holes in an exterior surface of the side wall. An electronic system is positioned within the interior cavity of the end cap.

<claims>
1. A grip for installation on a shaft, the grip comprising: a main body comprising a shaft cavity extending from an open first end to a second end, wherein the shaft cavity is configured to receive the shaft therein; an end cap attached to the second end of the main body, wherein the end cap comprises a base adjacent to the second end of the main body, wherein the base comprises one or more vent openings to one or more vent paths, a side wall extending from the base, wherein the side wall defines an interior cavity, and the one or more vent paths, wherein each of the one or more vent paths provides fluid communication between at least one of the one or more vent openings and at least one of one or more vent holes in an exterior surface of the side wall; and an electronic system within the interior cavity of the end cap.
2. The grip of claim 1, wherein the main body is substantially cylindrical.
3. The grip of claim 2, wherein the end cap is circular in plan view.
4. The grip of claim 3, wherein the side wall of the end cap is annular.
5. The grip of claim 4, wherein the electronic system is circular in plan view.
6. The grip of claim 1, wherein each of the one or more vent openings is in a region of the base that defines a base of the interior cavity, so as to provide fluid communication between the shaft cavity of the main body and the interior cavity.
7. The grip of claim 6, wherein each of the one or more vent paths comprises a groove that extends outward through an interior surface of the region of the base that defines the base of the interior cavity, and up an interior surface of the side wall, to at least one of the one or more vent holes, such that each vent path provides fluid communication through the interior cavity around the electronic system.
8. The grip of claim 7, wherein the one or more vent openings consist of a single vent opening in a center of the region of the base that defines the base of the interior cavity.
9. The grip of claim 8, wherein the one or more vent paths comprise a plurality of vent paths radiating outward from the single vent opening in the center of the region of the base that defines the base of the interior cavity.
10. The grip of claim 9, wherein the plurality of vent paths are equidistantly spaced apart from each other around a longitudinal axis of the grip.
11. The grip of claim 10, wherein the plurality of vent paths comprises at least four vent paths.
12. The grip of claim 11, wherein the plurality of vent paths consists of four vent paths.
13. The grip of claim 1, wherein, in a cross-sectional view along a longitudinal axis of the grip, the side wall has a first inner diameter around the longitudinal axis, extends from the base for a height h, and curves inward toward the longitudinal axis to a second inner diameter around the longitudinal axis that is less than first inner diameter.
14. The grip of claim 13, wherein the electronic system has an outer diameter that is equal to or less than the first inner diameter but greater than the second inner diameter, and wherein the electronic system has a height that is equal to or less than the height h.
15. The grip of claim 1, wherein the electronic system comprises at least one sensor.
16. The grip of claim 15, wherein the electronic system further comprises: at least one wireless transmitter; and at least one processor configured to transmit data, derived from the at least one sensor, over the at least one wireless transmitter to an external device.
17. The grip of claim 1, wherein the shaft cavity is configured in shape and size to receive a handle of a golf club, and wherein an exterior surface of the main body is textured.
18. The grip of claim 1, wherein each of the one or more vent paths corresponds one-to-one with one of the one or more vent openings and corresponds one-to-one with one of the one or more vent holes, so as to provide fluid communication between a corresponding vent opening and a corresponding vent hole.
19. The grip of claim 18, wherein each of the one or more vent paths comprises a straight linear path between its corresponding vent opening and its corresponding vent hole.
20. The grip of claim 1, wherein the one or more vent holes are in a top exterior surface of the side wall.
21. The grip of claim 1, wherein the main body further comprises one or more vent holes through a side of the main body, wherein each of the one or more vent holes in the main body provides fluid communication between the shaft cavity and an exterior of the main body.
