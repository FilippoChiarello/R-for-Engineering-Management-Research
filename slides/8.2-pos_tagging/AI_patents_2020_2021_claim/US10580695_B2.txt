<title>
Feature fill with nucleation inhibition
</title>

<abstract>
Described herein are methods of filling features with tungsten, and related systems and apparatus, involving inhibition of tungsten nucleation. In some embodiments, the methods involve selective inhibition along a feature profile. Methods of selectively inhibiting tungsten nucleation can include exposing the feature to a direct or remote plasma. Pre-inhibition and post-inhibition treatments are used to modulate the inhibition effect, facilitating feature fill using inhibition across a wide process window. The methods described herein can be used to fill vertical features, such as in tungsten vias, and horizontal features, such as vertical NAND (VNAND) wordlines. The methods may be used for both conformal fill and bottom-up/inside-out fill. Examples of applications include logic and memory contact fill, DRAM buried wordline fill, vertically integrated memory gate and wordline fill, and 3-D integration using through-silicon vias.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: providing a substrate including a feature having one or more feature openings and a feature interior; exposing the feature to at least one of: an oxidizing environment, a vacuum break, a reducing agent soak, and a tungsten-containing agent soak; after exposing the feature and prior to depositing tungsten in the feature, selectively inhibiting tungsten nucleation in the feature such that there is a differential inhibition profile along a feature axis; and selectively depositing tungsten in the feature in accordance with the differential inhibition profile, wherein exposing the feature comprises exposing a tungsten bulk layer or a non-tungsten surface to the at least one of an oxidizing environment, a vacuum break, a reducing agent soak, and a tungsten-containing agent soak.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein selectively inhibiting tungsten nucleation in the feature comprises exposing the feature to a direct plasma while applying a bias to the substrate.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the plasma contains one or more of nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen and carbon activated species.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein selectively inhibiting tungsten nucleation in the feature comprises a non-plasma process.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the non-plasma process comprises exposing the feature to a non-plasma nitrogen-containing gas.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein exposing the feature to one of: an oxidizing environment, a vacuum break, a reducing agent soak, and a tungsten-containing agent soak comprises a reducing agent soak.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the reducing agent is one of a diborane and silane.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein selectively inhibiting tungsten nucleation in the feature comprises exposing the feature to a remote plasma.
9. The method of claim 6, wherein the reducing agent soak comprises adsorbing reducing agent species on the feature surface.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the reducing agent soak increases the inhibition.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein exposing the feature to one of: an oxidizing environment, a vacuum break, a reducing agent soak, and a tungsten-containing agent soak comprises exposing the feature to an oxidizing environment.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein exposing the feature to one of: a vacuum break, a reducing agent soak, and a tungsten-containing agent soak comprises exposing the feature to a vacuum break.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein exposing the feature to one of: an oxidizing environment, a vacuum break, a reducing agent soak, and a tungsten-containing agent soak comprises exposing the feature to a tungsten-containing agent soak.
