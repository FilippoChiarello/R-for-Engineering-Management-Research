</title>

<abstract>
A network device may identify a configuration of resources that are to support attachable line cards. The configuration may include a power supply configuration that is used to provide power to packet processing components that are supported by the line cards, and a resource distribution configuration indicating whether resources in the line cards are shared between the packet processing components. The network device may determine whether to modify a power state of a packet processing component based on whether one or more power modification conditions are satisfied. The network device may modify the power state of the packet processing component based on determining that the power modification condition is satisfied. The power state of the packet processing component may be able to be modified to a particular power state based on the configuration of resources.
