<title>
Image processing device, image processing method, and non-transitory computer-readable recording medium storing image processing program
</title>

<abstract>
An image processing device includes: an image input unit that inputs a facial image from a predetermined device; an image analyzing unit that calculates one of facial shape, proportion lines that are lines drawn on the face to analyze the balance of the face, and blocking lines that divide the face into multiple regions following the structure of the face according to lightness and darkness of shadows due to light striking the face, based on facial feature points extracted from the facial image; and an image generating unit that decides a superimposing region of a makeup parts image based on one of the facial shape, the proportion lines, and the blocking lines, and generates a simulation image where the makeup parts image has been superimposed on the superimposing region.

<claims>
1. An image processing device comprising: an image input unit that inputs a facial image from a predetermined device; an image analyzer that calculates one of a facial shape, proportion lines that are lines drawn on the face to analyze the balance of the face, and blocking lines that divide the face into multiple regions following the structure of the face according to lightness and darkness of shadows arising due to light striking the face, based on facial feature points extracted from the facial image; and an image generator that determines a superimposing region of a makeup parts image based on one of the facial shape, the proportion lines, and the blocking lines, and generates a simulation image where the makeup parts image has been superimposed on the superimposing region wherein the image generator calculates an overspread region where the facial shape spreads out from a standard facial shape that has been set beforehand, and an insufficient region where the facial shape does not fill out the standard facial shape, determines a region of the facial image corresponding to the overspreading region to be a superimposing region for a first makeup parts image, and determines a region of the facial image corresponding to the insufficient region to be a superimposing region for a second makeup parts image that is different from the first makeup parts image.
2. The image processing device according to claim 1, wherein the first makeup parts image is a lowlight image, and wherein the second makeup parts image is a highlight image.
3. The image processing device according to claim 1, wherein the image analyzer calculates a first proportion line, a second proportion line below the first proportion line, and a third proportion line below the second proportion line, that divide the facial image in the vertical direction, and wherein the image generator determines, in a case where a first distance between the first proportion line and the second proportion line is longer than a second distance between the second proportion line and the third proportion line, a superimposing position of the makeup parts image where the makeup parts image is laid out upwards, and determines, in a case where the second distance is longer than the first distance, a superimposing position of the makeup parts image where the makeup parts image is laid out downwards.
4. The image processing device according to claim 3, wherein the makeup parts image is a cheek color image.
5. The image processing device according to claim 1, wherein the image analyzer calculates a fourth proportion line indicating a maximum vertical width of the facial image, and a fifth proportion line indicating a maximum lateral width of the facial image, and wherein the image generator determines, in a case where the fourth proportion line is longer than the fifth proportion line, a superimposing position of the makeup parts image where a longitudinal direction of the makeup parts image is laid out following the lateral width of the facial image, and determines, in a case where the fifth proportion line is longer than the fourth proportion line, a superimposing position of the makeup parts image where the makeup parts image is laid out obliquely from a cheek toward a mouth corner.
6. The image processing device according to claim 1, wherein the image generator generates the simulation image where an image of the proportion lines is superimposed on the facial image and calculates the proportion lines.
7. The image processing device according to claim 1, wherein the image generator generates the simulation image where an image of the blocking lines is superimposed on the facial image and calculates the blocking lines.
8. The image processing device according to claim 1, wherein, in a case of having received an instruction to change positions of the proportion lines, the image generator generates a facial image where at least one of the form and position of a facial part in the facial image has been changed based on the positions of the proportion lines after changing and calculates the proportion lines.
9. The image processing device according to claim 1, wherein the image analyzer calculates at least three or more of the proportion lines, and wherein the image generator changes, in a case of having received an instruction for idealization of facial balance of the facial image, the positions of the proportion lines to where the distances between the proportion lines are at a ratio decided beforehand, and generates a facial image where at least one of the form and position of a facial part in the facial image has been changed based on the positions of the proportion lines after changing.
10. The image processing device according to claim 1, wherein the image generator outputs the simulation image to a predetermined display device.
11. An image processing method, comprising: inputting a facial image from a predetermined device; calculating one of a facial shape, proportion lines that are lines drawn on the face to analyze the balance of the face, and blocking lines that divide the face into multiple regions following the structure of the face according to lightness and darkness of shadows arising due to light striking the face, based on facial feature points extracted from the facial image; determining a superimposing region of a makeup parts image in the facial image, based on one of the facial shape, the proportion lines, and the blocking lines; generating a simulation image where the makeup parts image has been superimposed on the superimposing region; calculating an overspread region where the facial shape spreads out from a standard facial shape that has been set beforehand, and an insufficient region where the facial shape does not fill out the standard facial shape; determining a region of the facial image corresponding to the overspreading region to be a superimposing region for a first makeup parts image; and determining a region of the facial image corresponding to the insufficient region to be a superimposing region for a second makeup parts image that is different from the first makeup parts image.
12. A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium storing an image processing program that causes a computer to execute the operations of inputting a facial image from a predetermined device, calculating one of a facial shape, proportion lines that are lines drawn on the face to analyze the balance of the face, and blocking lines that divide the face into multiple regions following the structure of the face according to lightness and darkness of shadows arising due to light striking the face, based on facial feature points extracted from the facial image, determining a superimposing region of a makeup parts image in the facial image, based on one of the facial shape, the proportion lines, and the blocking lines, and generating a simulation image where the makeup parts image has been superimposed on the superimposing region, calculating an overspread region where the facial shape spreads out from a standard facial shape that has been set beforehand, and an insufficient region where the facial shape does not fill out the standard facial shape, determining a region of the facial image corresponding to the overspreading region to be a superimposing region for a first makeup parts image, and determining a region of the facial image corresponding to the insufficient region to be a superimposing region for a second makeup parts image that is different from the first makeup parts image.
