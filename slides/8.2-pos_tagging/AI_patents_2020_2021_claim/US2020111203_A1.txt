METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING VEHICLE DAMAGE INFORMATION
</title>

<abstract>
A method and an apparatus for generating vehicle damage information are provided. The method includes: acquiring a damage area image of a target vehicle; performing image segmentation on the damage area image to obtain a first suspected damage area; inputting the damage area image to a pre-trained detection model to obtain a second suspected damage area, the detection model being configured to detect a location of the suspected damage area in the image; determining a damage image feature based on the first suspected damage area and the second suspected damage area; and inputting the damage image feature to a pre-trained classification model to generate a damage type, the classification model being configured to characterize a corresponding relationship between the image feature and the damage type.
