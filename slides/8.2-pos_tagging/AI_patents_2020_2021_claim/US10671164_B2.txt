<title>
Interface for electroencephalogram for computer control
</title>

<abstract>
A method for analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is disclosed. Information associated with two or more options is presented to a user. EEG signals from a sensor coupled to the user are received contemporaneously to the user receiving information associated with the two or more options. The EEG signals are processed in real time to determine which one of the options was selected by the user. In response to determining which one of the options was selected by the user, an action from one or more possible actions associated with the information presented to the user is selected. An output associated with the selected action is then generated.

<claims>
1. A method for analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, comprising: presenting information associated with two or more options to a user; receiving EEG signals from a sensor coupled to the user contemporaneously to the information associated with the two or more options being presented to the user; identifying, from the EEG signals, a selection by the user of an option from among the two or more options, wherein identifying the selection comprises determining that, within a predetermined time period of the option being presented to the user, an amplitude of the EEG signals exceeded a threshold amplitude value; in response to identifying the option selected by the user, selecting an action from one or more possible actions associated with the information presented to the user; and generating an output associated with the action, and wherein the threshold amplitude value and the predetermined time period are values obtained from training a machine learning algorithm according to a training process of presenting a series of task-relevant stimuli and non-task relevant-stimuli to users and classifying EEG data responsive to presentation of the task-relevant stimuli as distinct from EEG data responsive to presentation of the non-task-relevant stimuli, and wherein the task relevant stimuli are associated with a user-performed task that the users are expected to complete upon perceiving the presentation of the task-relevant stimuli.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the generated output comprises a control signal for an electronic device.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the presenting, receiving, processing, and generating are part of a closed-loop feedback system through which the user controls the electronic device.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the information is presented to the user using the electronic device.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein presenting the information comprises presenting the information visibly or audibly to the user.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the information is presented based on an object detected in the user's environment.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the object is detected based using machine vision.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein processing the EEG signals comprises cleaning the EEG signals in real time.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein cleaning the EEG signals comprises increasing a signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG signals.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the EEG signals are cleaned according to a machine learning model.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein processing the EEG signals comprises performing mathematical transformations on the EEG signals in real time after cleaning the EEG signals to determine which one of the options was selected by the user.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the mathematical transformations are performed according to a machine learning model.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the machine learning model maps a time series of values corresponding to an amplitude or change in amplitude of the EEG signal to an output variable corresponding to one of the options based on a mapping function.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the mapping function is determined by training the machine learning model.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein generating an output comprises presenting the user with additional information associated with the selected action.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the additional information associated with the selected action is information associated with two or more further options.
17. The method of claim 1, wherein generating an output comprises sending instructions over a network in communication with a processor used to process the EEG signals.
18. The method of claim 1, wherein the series of task-relevant stimuli interspersed with non-task relevant-stimuli comprises equal numbers of task-relevant stimuli and non-task relevant-stimuli.
19. The method of claim 1, wherein the task-relevant stimuli comprise an image presented repeatedly, the image being associated with a task of counting how often the image is presented.
20. The method of claim 1, wherein the task-relevant stimuli comprise images of a routinely encountered object.
