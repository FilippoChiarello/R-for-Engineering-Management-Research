TECHNOLOGIES FOR PROVIDING MULTIPLE TIER MEMORY MEDIA MANAGEMENT
</title>

<abstract>
Technologies for providing multiple tier memory media management include a memory having a media access circuitry connected to a memory media. The media access circuitry is to receive a request to perform an in-memory compute operation. Additionally, the media access circuitry is to read, in response to the request, data from a memory media region of the memory media, write the read data into a compute media region of the memory, perform, on the data in the compute media region, the in-memory compute operation, write, to the memory media region, resultant data indicative of a result of performance of the in-memory compute operation.

media access circuitry connected to a memory media, wherein the media access circuitry is to: receive a request to perform an in-memory compute operation; read, in response to the request, data from a memory media region of the memory media, wherein the memory media region is to be managed by a memory controller; write the read data into a compute media region of the memory, wherein the compute media region is to be managed by the media access circuitry; perform, on the data in the compute media region, the in-memory compute operation; and write, to the memory media region, resultant data indicative of a result of performance of the in-memory compute operation.
2. The memory of claim 1, wherein the media access circuitry is further to receive, from the memory controller, location data indicative of a one or more locations of the data to be read from the memory media region of the memory media.
3. The memory of claim 1, wherein the media access circuitry is further to write at least a portion of the read data to one or more scratch pads.
4. The memory of claim 1, wherein to perform the requested in-memory compute operation comprises to perform a tensor operation.
5. The memory of claim 1, wherein the media access circuitry is further to perform multiple writes to or multiple read from the compute media region in the performance of the in-memory compute operation.
6. The memory of claim 1, wherein the media access circuitry is further to: distribute memory accesses across the compute media region in the performance of the in-memory compute operation. track, with memory media usage data, the memory accesses; and update, as a function of the memory media usage data, reference voltage data usable to determine data values present in the memory media.
7. The memory of claim 1, wherein to receive a request to perform an in-memory compute operation comprises to receive a request to perform a matrix operation.
8. The memory of claim 1, wherein the media access circuitry is formed from a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor.
9. The memory of claim 1, wherein the memory media has a three dimensional cross point architecture.
10. The memory of claim 1, wherein the media access circuitry is further to perform a first error correction algorithm and the memory controller is to perform a second error correction algorithm that is different from the first error correction algorithm.
11. A method comprising: receiving, by media access circuitry connected to a memory media, a request to perform an in-memory compute operation; reading, by the media access circuitry and in response to the request, data from a memory media region of the memory media, wherein the memory media region is to be managed by a memory controller; writing, by the media access circuitry, the read data into a compute media region of the memory, wherein the compute media region is to be managed by the media access circuitry; performing, by the media access circuitry and on the data in the compute media region, the in-memory compute operation; and writing, by the media access circuitry and to the memory media region, resultant data indicative of a result of performance of the in-memory compute operation.
