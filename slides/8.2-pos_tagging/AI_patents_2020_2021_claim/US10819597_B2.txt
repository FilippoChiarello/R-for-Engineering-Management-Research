<title>
Network device measurements employing white boxes
</title>

<abstract>
A system for network device measurements may use a white box to perform measurements that may help determine the likelihood of network anomalies, such as microbursts.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising: obtaining, by a measurement device, ingress packets at an ingress tap of a network device; obtaining, by the measurement device, egress packets at an egress tap of the network device; analyzing, by the measurement device, the ingress packets to obtain ingress information; analyzing, by the measurement device, the egress packets to obtain egress information; based on the ingress information or the egress information, determining, by the measurement device, respective egress packets that match respective ingress packets; determining, by the measurement device, during a period a threshold change in delay between the respective egress packets that match the respective ingress packets; based on the threshold change in delay between the respective egress packets that match the respective ingress packets, determining, by the measurement device, that a microburst network anomaly occurred; and based on the determining that the microburst network anomaly occurred, sending, by the measurement device, an indication to take an action to prevent subsequent microburst network anomalies from occurring.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the measurement device is a white box device.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the action to prevent subsequent microburst network anomalies from occurring comprises rate limiting based on a source IP.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the egress information comprises time stamp of the egress packets or interface utilization.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising based on the egress information, adjusting, by the measurement device, a first threshold associated with identifying the microburst network anomaly to a second threshold associated with identifying the microburst network anomaly.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the determining the microburst network anomaly has occurred is further based on telemetry information of the ingress packets.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the microburst network anomaly occurring is further based on unauthorized network scanning.
8. A device comprising: a processor; and a memory coupled with the processor, the memory storing executable instructions that when executed by the processor cause the processor to effectuate operations comprising: obtaining ingress packets at an ingress tap of a network device; obtaining egress packets at an egress tap of the network device; analyzing the ingress packets to obtain ingress information; analyzing the egress packets to obtain egress information; based on the ingress information or the egress information, determining respective egress packets that match respective ingress packets; determining during a period a threshold change in delay between the respective egress packets that match the respective ingress packets; based on the threshold change in delay between the respective egress packets that match the respective ingress packets, determining that a microburst network anomaly occurred; and based on the determining that the microburst network anomaly occurred, sending an indication to take an action to prevent subsequent microburst network anomalies from occurring.
9. The device of claim 8, wherein the device is a white box device.
10. The device of claim 8, wherein the action to prevent subsequent microburst network anomalies from occurring comprises rate limiting based on a source IP.
11. The device of claim 8, wherein the egress information comprises time stamp of the egress packets or interface utilization.
12. The device of claim 8, the operations further comprising based on the egress information, adjusting a first threshold associated with identifying the microburst network anomaly to a second threshold associated with identifying the microburst network anomaly.
13. The device of claim 8, wherein the determining the microburst network anomaly has occurred is further based on telemetry information of the ingress packets.
14. The device of claim 8, wherein the microburst network anomaly occurring is further based on unauthorized network scanning.
15. A computer readable storage medium storing computer executable instructions that when executed by a computing device cause said computing device to effectuate operations comprising: obtaining ingress packets at an ingress tap of a network device; obtaining egress packets at an egress tap of the network device; analyzing the ingress packets to obtain ingress information; analyzing the egress packets to obtain egress information; based on the ingress information or the egress information, determining respective egress packets that match respective ingress packets; determining during a period a threshold change in delay between the respective egress packets that match the respective ingress packets; based on the threshold change in delay between the respective egress packets that match the respective ingress packets, determining that a microburst network anomaly occurred; and based on the determining that the microburst network anomaly has occurred, sending an indication to take an action to prevent subsequent microburst network anomalies from occurring a snapshot of data to an analysis engine.
16. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the microburst network anomaly occurring is further based on unauthorized network scanning.
17. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the action to prevent subsequent microburst network anomalies from occurring comprises rate limiting based on a source IP.
18. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the egress information comprises time stamp of the egress packets or interface utilization.
19. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, the operations further comprising based on the egress information, adjusting a first threshold associated with identifying the microburst network anomaly to a second threshold associated with identifying the microburst network anomaly.
20. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the determining the microburst network anomaly has occurred is further based on telemetry information of the ingress packets.
