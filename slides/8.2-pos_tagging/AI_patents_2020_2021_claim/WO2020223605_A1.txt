<title>
SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CHARGE SHARING COMPENSATION FOR X-RAY PHOTON COUNTING DETECTORS
</title>

<abstract>
A system for charge sharing compensation for a photon counting detector. A plurality of comparators, each configured to generate comparator output data based on a threshold value, a plurality of energy bins, each of the plurality of energy bins coupled to one of the plurality of comparators, and a coincidence logic coupled to two or more of the plurality of comparators and configured to receive comparator output data associated with two or more of a plurality of pixels. The comparator output data for each pixel indicates when a signal associated with the pixel crosses a threshold value. The coincidence logic is configured to generate a coincidence output when the comparator output data for a first pixel is received within a predetermined time interval of the comparator output data for a second pixel. The system includes a coincidence counting bin coupled to the coincidence logic and configured to receive the coincidence output and generate count data based on the coincidence output.
