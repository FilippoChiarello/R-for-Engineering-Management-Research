</title>

<abstract>
A voice synthesis method includes: supplying a first trained model with control data including phonetic identifier data to generate a series of frequency spectra of harmonic components; supplying a second trained model with the control data to generate a waveform signal representative of non-harmonic components; and generating a voice signal including the harmonic components and the non-harmonic components based on the series of frequency spectra of the harmonic components generated by the first trained model and the waveform signal representative of the non-harmonic components generated by the second trained model.
