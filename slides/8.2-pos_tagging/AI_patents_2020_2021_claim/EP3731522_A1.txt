METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROCESSING VIDEO SIGNAL ON BASIS OF HISTORY-BASED MOTION VECTOR PREDICTION
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosure discloses a method for processing video signals and an apparatus therefor. Specifically, the method of processing video signals based on history based motion vector prediction, comprising: configuring a merge candidate list based on a neighboring block to a current block; adding a history based merge candidate of the current block to the merge candidate list when a number of merge candidates included in the merge candidate list is smaller than a first predetermined number; adding a zero motion vector to the merge candidate list when the number of merge candidates included in the merge candidate list is smaller than a second predetermined number; obtaining a merge index indicating a merge candidate used for inter prediction of the current block in the merge candidate list; generating a prediction sample of the current block based on motion information of the merge candidate indicated by the merge index; and updating a history based merge candidate list based on the motion information.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of processing video signals based on history based motion vector prediction, comprising: configuring a merge candidate list based on a neighboring block to a current block; adding a history based merge candidate of the current block to the merge candidate list when a number of merge candidates included in the merge candidate list is smaller than a first predetermined number; adding a zero motion vector to the merge candidate list when the number of merge candidates included in the merge candidate list is smaller than a second predetermined number; obtaining a merge index indicating a merge candidate used for inter prediction of the current block in the merge candidate list; generating a prediction sample of the current block based on motion information of the merge candidate indicated by the merge index; and updating a history based merge candidate list based on the motion information, wherein the history based merge candidate is added to the merge candidate list when the history based merge candidate includes motion information which is not identical to motion information of a predefined merge candidate among merge candidates included in the merge candidate list.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the history based merge candidate list is defined to have a size which is determined based on a maximum number of the mum merge candidates in the merge candidate list.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the history based merge candidate list is defined to have a size same as a value obtained by subtracting one from a maximum number of the mum merge candidates in the merge candidate list.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein a size of the history based merge candidate list is defined as 5.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the history based merge candidate is added to the merge candidate list when the history based merge candidate includes motion information different from motion information of a specific number of predefined merge candidates among merge candidates included in the merge candidate list.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the history based merge candidate is added to the merge candidate list when the history based merge candidate includes motion information different from motion information of specific spatial merge candidates included in the merge candidate list.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the history based merge candidate is derived from a predetermined number of candidates within the the history based merge candidate list.
8. An apparatus of processing video signals based on inter prediction, comprising: a memory configured to storing the video signals; and a processor combined to the memory, wherein the processor is configured for: configuring a merge candidate list based on a neighboring block to a current block; adding a history based merge candidate of the current block to the merge candidate list when a number of merge candidates included in the merge candidate list is smaller than a first predetermined number; adding a zero motion vector to the merge candidate list when the number of merge candidates included in the merge candidate list is smaller than a second predetermined number; obtaining a merge index indicating a merge candidate used for inter prediction of the current block in the merge candidate list; generating a prediction sample of the current block based on motion information of the merge candidate indicated by the merge index; and updating a history based merge candidate list based on the motion information, wherein the history based merge candidate is added to the merge candidate list when the history based merge candidate includes motion information which is not identical to motion information of a predefined merge candidate among merge candidates included in the merge candidate list.
9. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the history based merge candidate list is defined to have a size which is determined based on a maximum number of the mum merge candidates in the merge candidate list.
10. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the history based merge candidate list is defined to have a size same as a value obtained by subtracting one from a maximum number of the mum merge candidates in the merge candidate list.
11. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein a size of the history based merge candidate list is defined as 5.
12. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the history based merge candidate is added to the merge candidate list when the history based merge candidate includes motion information different from motion information of a specific number of predefined merge candidates among merge candidates included in the merge candidate list.
13. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the history based merge candidate is added to the merge candidate list when the history based merge candidate includes motion information different from motion information of specific spatial merge candidates included in the merge candidate list.
14. The apparatus of claim 13, wherein the history based merge candidate is derived from a predetermined number of candidates within the the history based merge candidate list.
