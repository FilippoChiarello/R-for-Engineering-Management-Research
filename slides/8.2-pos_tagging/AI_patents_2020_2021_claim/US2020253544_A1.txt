<title>
COMBINING MULTIPLE QEEG FEATURES TO ESTIMATE DRUG-INDEPENDENT SEDATION LEVEL USING MACHINE LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure describes systems and methods of estimating sedation level of a patient using machine learning. For example, the integration of multiple QEEG features into a single sedation level estimation system using machine learning could result in a significant improvement in the predictability of the levels of sedation, independent of the sedative drug used. The present disclosure advantageously allows for the incorporation of large numbers of QEEG features and machine learning into the next-generation monitors of sedation level. Different QEEG features may be selected for different sedation drugs, such as propofol, sevoflurane and dexmedetomidine groups. The sedation level estimation system can maintain a high performance for detecting MOAA/S, independent of the drug used.

<claims>
1. A method for generating a sedation level estimate, the method comprising: receiving an electroencephalography (EEG) signal from a sensor electrode attached to the patient, the EEG signal comprising a plurality of channels; segmenting the EEG signal into smaller epochs for each channel; extracting features of the EEG signal in each epoch; determining a median of features among the plurality of channels for each epoch; determining, by a classifier, a probabilistic estimate of a patient sedation; generating, using a determined correlation, a sedation level estimate, the sedation level estimate comprising a continuous sedation score; and displaying an indication of the sedation level estimate.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein an epoch comprises 4 seconds.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the features comprise quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) features.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein extracting features comprises extracting at least 44 QEEG features.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein classifier comprises a binary classifier trained by machine learning.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the binary classifier is trained using awake and sedated epoch data, the awake and sedated epoch data comprising a plurality of epochs having sedation scores.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein the sedation scores comprise a score on a scale of 0 to 5.
8. The method of claim 5, wherein the sedation scores comprise MOAA/S scores.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the determined correlation comprises a correlation between the probabilistic estimate of the patient sedation and a sedation score.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the determined correlation comprises a spearman rank-correlation.
11. A method of selecting a subset of EEG features for use in an electronic determination of sedation state across a plurality of drugs, said method comprising: receiving EEG signal data from an EEG sensor for a plurality of administered drugs; associating a human determined sedation score corresponding to patient's sedation state with the received EEG signal data; selecting EEG signals with the associated human determined sedation score that has a high degree of confidence; extracting a plurality of features from the selected EEG signals; training the plurality of features with the corresponding human determined sedation scores; and identifying a set of features with a high degree of correlation based on the training.
12. A method of determining sedation state of a patient, the method comprising: receiving EEG signal data from an EEG sensor; extracting features from the received EEG signal data; applying non-linear machine learning model to the received EEG signal data; and determining the sedation state based on the application of the non-linear machine learning model.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the non-linear machine learning model comprises ensemble tree with bagging model.
14. The method of claim 12, wherein the non-linear machine learning model comprises random forest model.
15. The method of claim 12, wherein the non-linear machine learning model comprises support vector machine with Gaussian kernel model.
16. The method of claim 12, wherein the non-linear machine learning model comprises elastic net logistic regression.
17. The method of claim 12, wherein the features comprise at least power in alpha band and power in beta band.
18. The method of claim 12, wherein the features comprise at least BSR, standard deviation of FM, SVDE and FD.
