SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PREDICTING ATRIAL ARRHYTHMIA
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for assessing a cardiac arrhythmia risk of a patient, such as a risk for developing atrial fibrillation, are disclosed. An exemplary medical-device system includes an arrhythmia predictor circuit configured to receive physiologic information of a patient, and in an absence of atrial tachyarrhythmia in the patient, determine a risk of the patient developing future atrial tachyarrhythmia using the physiologic information. In accordance with the arrhythmia risk indication, the system can generate an alert, or initiate more aggressive monitoring of a patient identified as having a high atrial tachyarrhythmia risk.

<claims>
1. A medical -device system for assessing a cardiac arrhyth ia risk of a patient, the system comprising:
an arrhythmia predictor circuit configured to:
receive physiologic information sensed from the patient; and determine a risk of the patient developing atrial tachyarrhythmia using the received physiologic information.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the physiologic information does not include electrocardiograph or electrogram information.
3. The system of claim 1 or 2, wherein the determining the risk of the patient developing atrial tachyarrhythmia does not include using a history of atrial tachyarrhyth ias in that patient.
4. The system of any of claims 1-3, wherein the arrhythmia predictor circuit is configured to generate a trend of the physiologic information, and to predict future atrial tachyarrhythmia using the trend when the patient is free of present atrial tachyarrhythmia.
5. The system of any of claims 1-4, wherein the arrhythmia predictor circuit is configured to generate the indication of arrhythmia risk if a signal metric of the receive physiologic information exceeds a threshold or falls within a value range.
6. The system of any of claims 1-5, wherein the received physiologic information includes cardiac acceleration information.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein cardiac acceleration information includes heart sounds (HS) information.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the arrhythmia predictor circuit is configured to generate from the receive physiologic information one or more of: a first (SI) heart sound intensity; a third (S3) heart sound intensity; or
a normalized S3 intensity with respect to SI intensity.
9. The system of any of claims 1-8, wherein the received physiologic information includes thoracic impedance information.
10. The system of any of claims 1-9, wherein the received physiologic information includes respiration information, and wherein the arrhythmia predictor circuit is configured to generate from the respiration information one or more of: a respiratory rate;
a respiratory volume metric; or
a rapid shallow breathing index.
11. The system of any of claims 1-10, wherein the arrhythmia predictor circuit is configured to generate two or more signal metrics using the received physiologic information, and to generate the indication of arrhythmia risk using a combination of the generated two or more signal metrics.
12. The system of any of claims 1-11, comprising an output circuit configured to present the arrhythmia risk indication to a user, or to generate an alert according to the arrhythmia risk indication.
13. The system of any of claims 1-12, comprising a therapy circuit configured to generate or adjust a therapy according to the arrhythmia risk indication.
14. The system of any of claims 1-13, wherein the arrhythmia predictor circuit is configured to generate the indication of arrhythmia risk in the absence of atrial tachyarrhyth ia further using patient demographic information or patient medical history information.
15. The system of any of claims 1-14, wherein the arrhythmia predictor circuit is configured to, in response to the generated arrhythmia risk indication satisfying a condition, update the received physiologic information or tune an arrhythmia risk stratification parameter.
