VEHICLE SERVICE CENTER DISPATCH SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to systems, non-transitory computer-readable media, and methods for intelligently dispatching vehicles to a vehicle service center to progress vehicles at a predefined rate through sequential stations of the vehicle service center. The disclosed systems can analyze services associated with vehicles. Based on the services, the disclosed systems can determine how to order, within a virtual queue, vehicles corresponding to the services. For example, the disclosed systems can predict a complexity associated with a service for a vehicle, and in turn, determine whether adding the vehicle to the service queue will allow the vehicle to move through a set of sequential stations in accordance with the predefined progression rate. In response, the disclosed systems can dispatch the vehicle, refrain from dispatching the vehicle, or otherwise dynamically respond to enable the vehicle to move through the set of sequential stations in accordance with the predefined progression rate.
