KPI aware complex enterprise applications with cognitive abilities to maximize productivity
</title>

<abstract>
A method, a system and a computer program product are provided. A computing system learns structures and workflows of an enterprise application based on historic usage data and configuration data. The computing system determines that the user needs help based on one or more of an occurrence of a timeout based on a lack of user input regarding the enterprise application, differences in a navigational pattern of the user as compared with navigational patterns of other users, and a relationship regarding the navigational pattern of the user and the objectives. Upon determining that the user needs help, guidance is provided to the user via an interactive user interface. A type of guidance offered depends on how the user needing the help was determined.
