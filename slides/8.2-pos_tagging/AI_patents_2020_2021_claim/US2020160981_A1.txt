MEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING APPARATUS, MEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING METHOD, AND STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
According to one embodiment, a medical image processing apparatus of an embodiment includes an acquirer, a reliability setter and a learner. The acquirer acquires training data created by a creator on the basis of a medical image. The reliability setter sets, to the training data acquired by the acquirer, reliability information based on a creation situation of the training data or information about the creator who created the training data. The learner generates a learned model using the training data according to weighting based on the reliability information set by the reliability setter.

<claims>
1. A medical image processing apparatus comprising: an acquirer configured to acquire training data created by a creator on the basis of a medical image; a reliability setter configured to sets, to the training data acquired by the acquirer, reliability information based on a creation situation of the training data or information about the creator who created the training data; and a learner configured to generates a learned model using the training data according to weighting based on the reliability information set by the reliability setter.
2. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: an input configured to receives an input operation of an operator; and a display configured to displays the medical image, wherein the acquirer acquires the training data generated on the basis of the input operation received from the input in a state in which the display displays the medical image.
3. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the acquirer acquires a creation time of the medical image or the training data, and the reliability setter sets the reliability information in which reliability increases as the creation time acquired by the acquirer is later.
4. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the training data includes at least one of presence or absence of a lesion with respect to the medical image, identification of a lesion type and designation of a specific region.
5. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the creation situation includes information about awareness of the creator.
6. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the information about the awareness includes one or both of a time required for creation of the training data by the creator and a confidence degree with respect to creation of the training data.
7. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the information about the creator includes one or both of information about qualifications possessed by the creator with respect to a medical field and information about a busyness degree of the creator.
8. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a display configured to displays an image; and an input configured to receives an input from an operator, wherein the reliability setter causes the display to display an input screen through which the operator inputs the reliability information through the input.
9. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the learner sets weight scores on the basis of items included in the creation situation and the information about the creator.
10. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the learner sets a weight score for a combination of a plurality of items included in the creation situation and the information about the creator.
11. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 9, wherein the learner generates the learned model on the basis of the weight scores.
12. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 9, further comprising an adjuster configured to adjusts weight scores set to the training data, wherein the adjuster adjusts weights set to the training data when a guideline associated with details of the training data has been changed.
13. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 12, wherein the adjuster excludes, from training data input to the learner, training data in which the weight scores are equal to or less than a predetermined value from among a plurality of pieces of training data set weight scores.
14. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 12, further comprising a storage configured to stores the training data set the weight scores, wherein the adjuster deletes, from the storage, training data in which the weight scores are equal to or less than a predetermined value from among a plurality of pieces of training data stored in the storage.
15. A medical image processing method, using a computer of a medical image processing apparatus, comprising: acquiring training data created by a creator on the basis of a medical image; setting, to the acquired training data, reliability information based on a creation situation of the training data or information about the creator who created the training data; and generating a learned model using the training data according to weighting based on the set reliability information.
16. A computer readable non-transitory storage medium storing a program causing a computer of a medical image processing apparatus: to acquire training data created by a creator on the basis of a medical image; to set, to the acquired training data, reliability information based on a creation situation of the training data or information about the creator who created the training data; and to generate a learned model using the training data according to weighting based on the set reliability information.
