SUBORBITAL SPACE TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM WITH RADAR SYSTEM AND ADS-B RECEIVER
</title>

<abstract>
The invention concerns a suborbital space traffic control system (20) that comprises: a radar system (21) configured to monitor a predetermined suborbital region (30) and detect and track objects (41, 42) in said predetermined suborbital region (30), wherein said objects include vehicles (41) and space debris (42); and a suborbital space traffic monitoring system (22) configured to: receive, from the radar system (21), tracking data related to the objects (41, 42) detected and tracked by said radar system (21); monitor, on the basis of the tracking data, trajectories of the objects (41, 42) in the predetermined suborbital region (30) using one or more predetermined machine-learning techniques to detect potentially hazardous situations for the vehicles (41) in said predetermined suborbital region (30); and, if it detects a potentially hazardous situation for one or more given vehicles (41), transmit corresponding alarm messages to said given vehicle(s) (41). The radar system (21) includes a primary radar sensor (211) equipped with an electronically scanned array antenna; an ADS-B receiver (212) based on Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast technology; and a radar processing unit (213), which is connected to the primary radar sensor (211) and to the ADS-B receiver (212) to receive data therefrom.
