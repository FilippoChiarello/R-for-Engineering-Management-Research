Analyzing data for inclusion in computer-based reasoning models
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques are provided herein for creating well-balanced computer-based reasoning systems and using those to control systems. The techniques include receiving a request to determine whether to use one or more particular features, cases, etc. in a computer-based reasoning model (e.g., as cases or features are being added, or as part of pruning existing features or cases). Conviction measures (such as targeted or untargeted conviction, contribution, surprisal, etc.) are determined and inclusivity conditions are tested. The result of comparing the conviction measure can be used to determine whether to include or exclude the feature, case, etc. in the computer-based reasoning model. A controllable system may then be controlled using the computer-based reasoning model. Examples controllable systems include self-driving cars, image labeling systems, manufacturing and assembly controls, federated systems, smart voice controls, automated control of experiments, energy transfer systems, and the like.
