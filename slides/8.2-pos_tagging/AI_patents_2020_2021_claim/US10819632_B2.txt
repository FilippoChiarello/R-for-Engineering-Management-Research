<title>
Routers and methods for traffic management
</title>

<abstract>
A router including a communication device, a first controller, a storage device, and a second controller is provided. The communication device receives a plurality of first packets of a connection and at least one second packet of the connection subsequent to the first packets. The first controller analyzes the first packets to determine a plurality of transport-layer parameters associated with the connection. The storage device stores the transport-layer parameters. The second controller performs traffic management on the second packet according to at least part of the transport-layer parameters stored in the storage device.

<claims>
1. A router, comprising: a communication device, configured to receive a plurality of first packets of a connection and at least one second packet of the connection subsequent to the first packets; a first processor, coupled to the communication device, and configured to analyze the first packets to determine a plurality of transport-layer parameters and a plurality of application-layer parameters associated with the connection, wherein the application-layer parameters comprise a rule tag; a first storage device, coupled to the first processor, and configured to store the transport-layer parameters and the application-layer parameters; and a hardware accelerator, coupled to the first processor and the first storage device, comprising a second processor and a second storage device; wherein, in response to the rule tag comprised in the application-layer parameters being set to TRUE, the first processor is further configured to retrieve the transport-layer parameters from the first storage device and store the transport-layer parameters into the second storage device, so as to offload packet processing task to the second processor by enabling the second processor to use the transport-layer parameters which are stored by the first processor into the second storage device to realize application-layer traffic monitoring on the second packet.
2. The router as claimed in claim 1, wherein the application-layer traffic monitoring is performed independent of the first processor.
3. The router as claimed in claim 1, wherein the application-layer traffic monitoring comprises: updating at least part of the transport-layer parameters in the first storage device according to a result of the application-layer traffic monitoring.
4. The router as claimed in claim 1, wherein the updated transport-layer parameters comprise at least one of the following: a total packet count of the connection; and a total packet size in bytes of the connection.
5. The router as claimed in of claim 1, wherein the transport-layer parameters comprise at least one of the following: a source Internet Protocol (IP) address and a destination IP address; a source port number and a destination port number; a source protocol and a destination protocol; a total packet count; and a total packet size.
6. The router as claimed in claim 1, wherein the application-layer parameters further comprise: an application identification.
7. The router as claimed in claim 6, wherein the first processor sets the rule tag to 'true' when determining the application identification.
8. The router as claimed in claim 7, wherein the second processor is further configured to forward the second packet in response to the rule tag being set to 'true'.
9. A traffic management method for a router comprising a first processor, a first storage device, and a hardware accelerator comprising a second processor and a second storage device, the traffic management method comprising: receiving a plurality of first packets of a connection and at least one second packet of the connection subsequent to the first packets; analyzing, by the first processor, the first packets to determine a plurality of transport-layer parameters and a plurality of application-layer parameters associated with the connection, wherein the application-layer parameters comprise a rule tag; storing the transport-layer parameters and the application-layer parameters in the first storage device; and in response to the rule tag comprised in the application-layer parameters being set to TRUE, retrieving, by the first processor, the transport-layer parameters from the first storage device and storing, by the first processor, the transport-layer parameters into the second storage device, so as to offload packet processing task to the second processor by enabling the second processor to use the transport-layer parameters which are stored by the first processor into the second storage device to realize application-layer traffic monitoring on the second packet.
10. The traffic management method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the application-layer traffic monitoring is performed independent of the first processor.
11. The traffic management method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the application-layer traffic monitoring comprises: updating, by the second processor, at least part of the transport-layer parameters in the first storage device according to a result of the application-layer traffic monitoring.
12. The traffic management method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the transport-layer parameters comprise at least one of the following: a source Internet Protocol (IP) address and a destination IP address; a source port number and a destination port number; a source protocol and a destination protocol; a total packet count; and a total packet size; wherein the updated transport-layer parameters comprise at least one of the total packet count and total packet size.
13. The traffic management method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the application-layer parameters further comprise: an application identification.
14. The traffic management method as claimed in claim 13, further comprising: setting, by the first processor, the rule tag to 'true' when determining the application identification.
