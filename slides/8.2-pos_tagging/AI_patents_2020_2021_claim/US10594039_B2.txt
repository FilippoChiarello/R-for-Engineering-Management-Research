Apparatus and methods for sending or receiving electromagnetic signals
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the subject disclosure may include a generator that facilitates generation of an electromagnetic wave, a core, and a waveguide that facilitates guiding the electromagnetic wave towards the core to induce a second electromagnetic wave that propagates along the core. The core and/or the waveguide can be configured to reduce radiation loss of the second electromagnetic wave, propagation loss of the second electromagnetic wave, or a combination thereof. Other embodiments are disclosed.

<claims>
1. A device, comprising: a generator that facilitates generation of a first electromagnetic wave; a core; and a waveguide that facilitates guiding the first electromagnetic wave towards the core, wherein the core comprises a first region and a second region, wherein the core comprises an interface in the first region, wherein the first electromagnetic wave induces at the interface a second electromagnetic wave, wherein the waveguide is configured to confine the second electromagnetic wave at least in part within the core in the first region, wherein the second region of the core is located within the waveguide, wherein a tapered section of the waveguide covering the second region is configured to reduce a radiation loss of the second electromagnetic wave as the second electromagnetic wave propagates and expands into the second region, and wherein the core comprises a third region that is not located within the waveguide.
2. The device of claim 1, wherein the second electromagnetic wave propagates along the core in the third region and is directed to another device coupled to the core in the third region.
3. The device of claim 2, wherein the second electromagnetic wave has a first average propagation loss in the second region, wherein the second electromagnetic wave has a second average propagation loss in the third region, and wherein the first average propagation loss exceeds the second average propagation loss.
