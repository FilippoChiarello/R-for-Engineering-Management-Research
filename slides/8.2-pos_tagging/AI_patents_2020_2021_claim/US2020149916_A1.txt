<title>
AUGMENTED REALITY NAVIGATIONAL OVERLAY
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method may generate a more realistic augmented reality (AR) overlay by generating a segmentation image and blending it with one or more other images. The system may generate a segmentation image based on an input image. The segmentation image may be blended with an AR path overlay image to generate an object-masked AR path overlay image. The object-masked AR path overlay image may be blended with the input image to generate an output image.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: generating a guidance indicator corresponding to a guidance route; obtaining an image of the guidance route including an object; generating a segmentation image based on the image, the segmentation image having first pixels corresponding to the object in the image; modifying a portion of the guidance indicator based on at least a position of the first pixels in the segmentation image by occluding the portion of the guidance indicator from first pixels; and displaying the modified guidance indicator on a display.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the segmentation image is performed by applying semantic segmentation on the image.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the image comprises an image of a roadway, and wherein the at least one object comprises at least one object on the roadway.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein generating the guidance indicator associated with the navigational guidance route comprises generating an augmented-reality path overlay image including the guidance indicator.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein modifying the guidance indicator based on the at least one object in the image comprises modifying pixels in the augmented-reality path overlay image that spatially correspond to the first pixels in the segmentation image.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein displaying the modified guidance indicator in association with the navigational guidance route comprises generating an output image by combining the image with the augmented-reality path overlay image having the modified guidance indicator.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising displaying the output image on a display of a mobile electronic device.
8. The method of claim 5, wherein displaying the modified guidance indicator in association with the navigational guidance route comprises projecting the augmented-reality path overlay image having the modified guidance indicator onto a windshield of a vehicle.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining the navigational guidance route based on a global positioning system location and map information.
10. A navigation system comprising one or more non-transitory computer-readable media storing computer-executable instructions that, when executed on one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform acts comprising: generating a guidance indicator corresponding to a guidance route; obtaining an image of the guidance route including an object; generating a segmentation image based on the image, the segmentation image having first pixels corresponding to the object in the image; modifying a portion of the guidance indicator based on at least a position of the first pixels in the segmentation image; and displaying the modified guidance indicator on a display.
11. The navigation system of claim 10, wherein generating the segmentation image is performed by applying semantic segmentation on the image.
12. The navigation system of claim 11, wherein the image comprises an image of a roadway, and wherein the at least one object comprises at least one object on the roadway.
13. The navigation system of claim 12, wherein generating the guidance indicator associated with the navigational guidance route comprises generating an augmented-reality path overlay image including the guidance indicator.
14. The navigation system of claim 13, wherein modifying the guidance indicator based on the at least one object in the image comprises modifying pixels in the augmented-reality path overlay image that spatially correspond to the first pixels in the segmentation image.
15. The navigation system of claim 14, wherein displaying the modified guidance indicator in association with the navigational guidance route comprises generating an output image by combining the image with the augmented-reality path overlay image having the modified guidance indicator.
16. The navigation system of claim 15, further comprising instructions for displaying the output image on a display of a mobile electronic device.
17. The navigation system of claim 16, wherein displaying the modified guidance indicator in association with the navigational guidance route comprises projecting the augmented-reality path overlay image having the modified guidance indicator onto a windshield of a vehicle.
18. A method for generating a path overlay, the method comprising: obtaining an image of the guidance route; generating a guidance indicator corresponding to a guidance route, the guidance indicator comprising a plurality of pixels; detecting a first object in the path of the guidance indicator; generating a segmentation image based on the image, the segmentation image having first pixels corresponding to the first object in the image; modifying the guidance indicator by occluding a portion of the guidance indicator by removing or dimming a portion of the plurality of pixels of the guidance indicator; and displaying the modified guidance indicator on a display.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the first object detected is a non-moving vehicle.
20. The method of claim 18, wherein the first object detected is a stationary object in the environment.
21. The method of claim 20, wherein the stationary object is one of a tree, sign, pedestrian, physical obstruction in the environment, traffic light, curb, building, bridge.
22. The method of claim 18, wherein the display is operably coupled to a moving vehicle, and wherein the first object detected is a portion of the moving vehicle.
23. The method of claim 22, wherein the portion of the moving vehicle is a hood portion of the vehicle such that the occluding of the portion of the guidance indicator is occluded by the hood portion of the vehicle.
