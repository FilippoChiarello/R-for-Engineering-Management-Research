SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CAPTURING PRESENTATION GESTURES
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method and system for, using a camera, detecting a gesture during a video stream; using a computing device, generating a digital drawing that corresponds to the gesture and storing the digital drawing in a database as a gesture layer; using the computing device, combining the gesture layer with the video stream to generate a gesture visualization; and using the computing device, causing the gesture visualization to be displayed in one or more displays of one or more other computing devices.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A computer-implemented method for improving digital capturing of gestures, the method comprising:
using a camera, detecting a gesture during a video stream;
using a computing device, generating a digital drawing that corresponds to the gesture and storing the digital drawing in a database as a gesture layer;
using the computing device, combining the gesture layer with the video stream to generate a gesture visualization; and
using the computing device, causing the gesture visualization to be displayed in one or more displays of one or more other computing devices.
2. The method of claim 1 , wherein detecting the gesture comprises detecting a gesture trigger using a trained machine learning model.
3. The method of claim 1 , further comprising:
detecting a gesture completion using a trained machine learning model.
4. The method of claim 1 , wherein generating the digital drawing is responsive to detecting a gesture completion.
5. The method of claim 1 , further comprising:
generating a first grid for a first frame of the video stream featuring the gesture; generating a first mark on the first grid, wherein the first mark represents a first placement of the gesture for the first frame;
generating a second grid for a second frame of the video stream featuring the gesture; generating a second mark on the second grid, wherein the second mark represents a second placement of the gesture for the second frame; and
wherein generating the digital drawing comprises connecting the first mark to the second mark.
6. The method of claim 1 , further comprising:
using the computing device, causing the gesture visualization to be displayed in a display associated with the computing device.
7. The method of claim 1 , wherein the gesture comprises movement from a human or an instrument.
8. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing a set of instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause:
using a camera, detecting a gesture during a video stream;
using a computing device, generating a digital drawing that corresponds to the gesture and storing the digital drawing in a database as a gesture layer;
using the computing device, combining the gesture layer with the video stream to generate a gesture visualization; and using the computing device, causing the gesture visualization to be displayed in one or more displays of one or more other computing devices.
9. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein detecting the gesture comprises detecting a gesture trigger using a trained machine learning model.
10. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, further comprising an
additional set of instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause:
detecting a gesture completion using a trained machine learning model.
1 1. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein generating the digital drawing is responsive to detecting a gesture completion.
12. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, further comprising an
additional set of instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause:
generating a first grid for a first frame of the video stream featuring the gesture;
generating a first mark on the first grid, wherein the first mark represents a first placement of the gesture for the first frame;
generating a second grid for a second frame of the video stream featuring the gesture; generating a second mark on the second grid, wherein the second mark represents a second placement of the gesture for the second frame; and
wherein generating the digital drawing comprises connecting the first mark to the second mark.
13. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, further comprising an additional set of instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause:
using the computing device, causing the gesture visualization to be displayed in a display associated with the computing device.
14. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein the gesture comprises movement from a human or an instrument.
15. A system for improving digital capturing of gestures, the system comprising:
a processor;
a memory operatively connected to the processor and storing instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause:
using a camera, detecting a gesture during a video stream;
using a computing device, generating a digital drawing that corresponds to the gesture and storing the digital drawing in a database as a gesture layer;
using the computing device, combining the gesture layer with the video stream to generate a gesture visualization; and
using the computing device, causing the gesture visualization to be displayed in one or more displays of one or more other computing devices.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein detecting the gesture comprises detecting a gesture trigger using a trained machine learning model.
17. The system of claim 15, wherein the memory stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor, further cause:
detecting a gesture completion using a trained machine learning model.
18. The system of claim 15, wherein generating the digital drawing is responsive to detecting a gesture completion.
19. The system of claim 15, wherein the memory stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor, further cause:
generating a first grid for a first frame of the video stream featuring the gesture;
generating a first mark on the first grid, wherein the first mark represents a first placement of the gesture for the first frame;
generating a second grid for a second frame of the video stream featuring the gesture; generating a second mark on the second grid, wherein the second mark represents a second placement of the gesture for the second frame; and
wherein generating the digital drawing comprises connecting the first mark to the second mark.
20. The system of claim 15, wherein the memory stores additional instructions that, when executed by the processor, further cause:
using the computing device, causing the gesture visualization to be displayed in a display associated with the computing device.
