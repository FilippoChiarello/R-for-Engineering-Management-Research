</title>

<abstract>
The invention provides methods for computing with chemicals by encoding digital data into a plurality of chemicals to obtain a dataset; translating the dataset into a chemical form; reading the data set; querying the dataset by performing an operation to obtain a perceptron; and analyzing the perceptron for identifying chemical structure and/or concentration of at least one of the chemicals, thereby developing a chemical computational language. The invention demonstrates a workflow for representing abstract data in synthetic metabolomes. Also presented are several demonstrations of kilobyte-scale image data sets stored in synthetic metabolomes, recovered at >99% accuracy.
