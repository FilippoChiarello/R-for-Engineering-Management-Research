AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF LABELED DATA IN IOT SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
A labeled data generation service provides an Internet-of-Things (IoT) system with a capability whereby users may configure how the system gathers, processes, and generates labeled data instances by: collecting and processing the data into a format required by supervised learning algorithms; generating expected outputs from data available in the IoT system; supporting the linking of collected inputs with generated expected outputs; forming labeled data instances; cleaning the labeled data set appropriately; sending the labeled data set to target nodes; and/or communicating with target nodes regarding improving the data processing and labeling processes, as required.

4. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the scaling of the processed data value for each of the raw data inputs comprises scaling the processed data value to fit a normalized linear scale of the plurality of raw data inputs.
5. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the scaling of the processed data value for each of the raw' data inputs comprises scaling the processed data value to fit a normalized logarithmic scale of the plurality of raw data inputs.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein, for one or more sets of raw data inputs, the
processing of the raw data inputs comprises deriving a processed data value for each plurality of raw data inputs m accordance with one or more statistical observations of the plurality of raw' data inputs.
7. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the one or more statistical observations of the set of raw data inputs comprises a computed mean, average, or standard deviation of the set of raw data inputs.
8. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise cleaning the
labeled data set prior to sending the labeled data set to the machine learning repository.
9. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the cleaning of the labeled data set comprises identifying duplicate labeled data instances in the labeled data set.
10. The apparatus of claim 9, wherein the cleaning of the labeled data set comprises removing the identified duplicate labeled data instances from the labeled data set.
