System and method for gesture recognition
</title>

<abstract>
Internet of Things (IoT) systems and related methods are disclosed. A method comprises determining whether a first condition holds, the first condition being a condition of the IoT system, performing a function of the IoT system in response to a trigger, wherein the trigger is a determination that the first condition holds, recognizing a gesture based on image data received from an image sensor, and reconfiguring the IoT system for a future performance of the function based on the user feedback data.
