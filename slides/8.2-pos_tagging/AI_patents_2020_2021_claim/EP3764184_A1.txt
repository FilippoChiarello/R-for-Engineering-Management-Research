ABNORMALITY DETERMINATION ASSISTANCE DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
The abnormality determination support apparatus comprises an analysis object data preparation unit, a primary determination unit, and a secondary determination unit. The analysis object data preparation unit acquires a time-series signal representing at least one of a state of the manufacturing facility and a product quality from a data collection apparatus of the manufacturing facility, and extracts analysis object data from the time-series signal. The primary determination unit derives a plurality of primary determination results from common analysis object data by applying a plurality of different types of analysis methods to the analysis object data extracted by the analysis object data preparation unit. The secondary determination unit includes a machine learning device which is learned using a pair of a primary determination result obtained by the primary determination unit and a corresponding set of an abnormality determination result and an abnormality cause, which is a correct answer, as a teacher signal, and inputs a plurality of primary determination results obtained from common analysis object data in the primary determination unit to the machine learning device, and outputs a secondary determination result and an estimated abnormality cause output from the machine learning device as the determination information.
