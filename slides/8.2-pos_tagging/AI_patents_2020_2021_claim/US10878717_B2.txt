<claims>
1. A very low nicotine cigarette for use in a method of assisting conventional cigarette smokers to switch to e-cigarettes or a tobacco heating device, the very low nicotine cigarette comprising a blended filler of low nicotine tobacco and very low Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) Cannabis sativa, wherein the very low THC Cannabis sativa comprises any of: flowers of a female Cannabis sativa plant; leaves of a Cannabis sativa plant; and reconstituted cannabis sheet comprising flowers, leaves or stems of a Cannabis sativa plant, wherein a content of the very low THC Cannabis sativa of the very low nicotine cigarette is at least 2 mg, wherein a nicotine content of the very low nicotine cigarette is equal to or less than 2.0 mg, and wherein a collective content of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) of the very low THC Cannabis sativa in the very low nicotine cigarette is equal to or less than 1.25 mg/g.
2. The very low nicotine cigarette according to claim 1, wherein the very low THC Cannabis sativa is from a Cannabis sativa plant in which Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid has been reduced, as compared to a control cannabis plant, by down-regulating the expression of tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase (SEQ ID NO: 21).
3. A kit for transitioning a smoker of conventional cigarettes to using a tobacco heating device, said kit comprising a plurality of the very low nicotine cigarettes according to claim 1, a tobacco heating device, tobacco sticks, and information and recommendations for transitioning the smoker from the conventional cigarettes to using the tobacco heating device.
4. A kit for transitioning a smoker of conventional cigarettes to using e-cigarettes, said kit comprising a plurality of the very low nicotine cigarettes according to claim 1, e-cigarettes, and information and recommendations for transitioning the smoker from the conventional cigarettes to using the e-cigarettes.
5. A method of transitioning a smoker of conventional cigarettes to an aerosol device, the method comprising: providing the smoker a transition kit including a supply of very low nicotine cigarettes, an aerosol device, and information and recommendations for using said cigarettes and aerosol device during a transitional period, wherein the supply of very low nicotine cigarettes equals at least 20 percent of the number of conventional cigarettes the smoker smokes per day multiplied by the number of days in the transitional period, wherein the very low nicotine cigarettes contain equal to or less than 2.0 mg of nicotine per cigarette and at least 5 mg of very-low-THC Cannabis sativa, said very-low-THC Cannabis sativa contains a collective amount of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) equal to or less than 1.25 mg/g, wherein the very low THC Cannabis sativa comprises any of: flowers of a female Cannabis sativa plant; leaves of a Cannabis sativa plant; and reconstituted cannabis sheet comprising flowers, leaves or stems of a Cannabis sativa plant, wherein the transitional period is less than 85 days, and wherein the information and recommendations include the following: instructions for the smoker to stop smoking conventional cigarettes at a first time point, commencing the transitional period, and after the first time point to smoke the very low nicotine cigarettes from the supply of very low nicotine cigarettes without restriction during the transitional period; recommendations or instructions that upon the smoker experiencing an overwhelming craving for a conventional cigarette, to use the aerosol device without restriction at a second time point; recommendations or instructions that after the second time point until the end of the transitional period, the smoker may also smoke the very low nicotine cigarettes without restriction; and recommendations or instructions for the smoker to stop smoking the very low nicotine cigarettes at the end of the transitional period and to continue to smoke the aerosol device.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the aerosol device comprises a tobacco heating device.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein the aerosol device comprises e-cigarettes.
