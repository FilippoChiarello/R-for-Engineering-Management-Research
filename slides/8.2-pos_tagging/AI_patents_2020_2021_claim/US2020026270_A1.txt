SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DATA COLLECTION AND FREQUENCY EVALUATION FOR PUMPS AND FANS
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems for data collection in an environment including pumps and fans are disclosed. A monitoring system may include a data collector communicatively coupled to a plurality of input channels, wherein the input channels are communicatively coupled to sensors measuring operational parameters of a pump or fan. A data storage may store one or more frequencies related to an operation of the pump or fan, and a data acquisition circuit may interpret a plurality of detection values from the collected data. A frequency evaluation circuit may detect a signal on one of the input channels at a frequency higher than the one or more frequencies at which the pump or fan operates.
