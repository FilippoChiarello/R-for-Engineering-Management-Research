CONFIGURING DISTRIBUTED SEQUENTIAL TRANSACTIONAL DATABASES
</title>

<abstract>
A computer implemented method of configuring a distributed sequential transactional database for a software application operating with the database, the method comprising: receiving a descriptor for the application specifying characteristics of the database required for the application; accessing the databases to determine an extent to which each the database complies with the characteristics in the descriptor; responsive to the determination, identifying one or more attributes of the database for adjustment based on the characteristics in the descriptor so as to improve the extent of compliance of the database with the characteristics in the descriptor, the one or more attributes being determined by a machine learning algorithm trained to categorise database characteristics in terms of suitable adjustments; adjusting the database in accordance with the determined attributes.

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method of configuring a distributed sequential transactional database for a software application operating with the database, the method comprising: receiving a descriptor for the application specifying characteristics of the database required for the application;
accessing the databases to determine an extent to which each the database complies with the characteristics in the descriptor;
responsive to the determination, identifying one or more attributes of the database for adjustment based on the characteristics in the descriptor so as to improve the extent of compliance of the database with the characteristics in the descriptor, the one or more attributes being determined by a machine learning algorithm trained to categorise database characteristics in terms of suitable adjustments;
adjusting the database in accordance with the determined attributes. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein the accessing and identifying steps are iterated until a stopping condition is met.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein the stopping condition includes the database complying with the characteristics in the descriptor to at least a predetermined threshold extent.
4. The method of any preceding claim wherein the distributed sequential transactional databases is a blockchain. 5. The method of any preceding claim wherein the characteristics of the database include one or more of: an algorithm used to validate a proof-of-work of a miner for the database; a format and/or length of an address used for entities transacting in the database; a number of peers in a miner network for the database; a characteristic of a genesis block of the database; a hashpower of the database; a consensus mechanism used for the database; a maximum block time and/or size for the database; an age of the database; a size of the database; a number of blocks of the database; an encryption algorithm or standard used for the database; a peer latency for the database; a transaction security protocol or standard for the database; and a description of the database. 6. A computer system including a processor and memory storing computer program code for performing the steps of the method of any preceding claim.
7. A computer program element comprising computer program code to, when loaded into a computer system and executed thereon, cause the computer to perform the steps of a method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5.
