<title>
Automated detection of emergent behaviors in interactive agents of an interactive environment
</title>

<abstract>
Various aspects of the subject technology relate to systems, methods, and machine-readable media for automated detection of emergent behaviors in interactive agents of an interactive environment. The disclosed system represents an artificial intelligence based entity that utilizes a trained machine-learning-based clustering algorithm to group users together based on similarities in behavior. The clusters are processed based on a determination of the type of activity of the clustered users. In order to identify new categories of behavior and to label those new categories, a separate cluster analysis is performed using interaction data obtained at a subsequent time. The additional cluster analysis determines any change in behavior between the clustered sets and/or change in the number of users in a cluster. The identification of emergent user behavior enables the subject system to treat users differently based on their in-game behavior and to adapt in near real-time to changes in their behavior.
