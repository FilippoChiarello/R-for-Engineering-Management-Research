Apparatus and Method for Guiding Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides a server apparatus and method for detecting connectivity anomalies for guiding unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The apparatus comprises an interface configured for acquiring a connectivity measurement result at a location in the flight area, and circuitry configured for determining a deviation between the measurement result and a predicted connectivity to detect a connectivity anomaly. Further provided is an aviation control node configured for receiving a report on a connectivity anomaly, and a method for an aviation control node. The present disclosure facilitates monitoring of a current connectivity state for providing safe and efficient UAV operation.
