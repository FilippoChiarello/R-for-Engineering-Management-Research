ANOMALY FACTOR ESTIMATION DEVICE, ANOMALY FACTOR ESTIMATION METHOD, AND STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A device for estimating a cause of an anomaly comprises: a detection unit to detect an anomaly in a detection target based on a learner trained on first numerical vectors obtained from a detection target when the detection target is under a normal condition and second numerical vectors to be obtained from the detection target at multiple time; and a first computing unit to compute, for each metric of a second numerical vector from which an anomaly has been detected, as information for estimating a metric of cause of the anomaly, a value obtained by subtracting, from a value of the metric, an average of the metric in the first numerical vectors, and dividing a result of the subtracting by standard deviation of the metric in the first numerical vectors. This device supports estimation of the cause of an anomaly detected in a target object for detecting an anomaly.
