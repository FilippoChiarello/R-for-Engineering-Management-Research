METHOD OF DEFENDING AGAINST INAUDIBLE ATTACKS ON VOICE ASSISTANT BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure discloses a machine learning-based method for defending a voice assistant from being controlled by an inaudible command, including following steps: 1) collecting data of positive and negative samples, 2) performing data segmentation on data of the positive and negative samples; 3) selecting and normalizing sample features; 4) selecting a classifier to be trained and generate a detection model for a malicious voice command; 5) detecting a voice command to be detected by the detection model. The present disclosure selects an original feature selection method, and for smart devices of different types, it is necessary to obtain normal voice commands and malicious voice commands by means of a smart device of this type, and use them as the positive and negative samples to train a specific classifier for the device. Such a customized approach can well solve a problem that detection and defense between devices cannot work.

<claims>
1. A method of defending against inaudible attacks on voice assistant based on machine learning, comprising steps of: 1) collecting data of positive and negative samples; 2) performing data segmentation on the collected data of the positive and negative samples; 3) selecting and normalizing sample features; wherein features are selected from voice data, and the features comprise: a minimum value, an average value, energy, skewness, kurtosis, spectrum mean, spectrum variance, spectrum standard deviation, irregularity, square root amplitude, spectrum centroid, the selected 11 features constitute a feature vector, and the feature vector replaces the collected voice data as input information in a subsequent process; normalization processing is performed on the feature vector of the samples, a maximum value of each sample feature is set to 1, the normalization processing has an input being a time domain frequency domain feature of each sample, and an output being a normalized time domain frequency domain feature; finally, normalized time-frequency domain features are labeled, wherein a label of a normal voice command feature is 1 and a label of a malicious voice feature is 0; 4) using the normalized and labeled time domain frequency domain features as a model input, performing training and generating a detection model for detecting a malicious voice command; and 5) detecting, by the detection model obtained by the training in the step 4), a voice command to be detected.
2. The method of defending against inaudible attacks on voice assistant based on machine learning according to claim 1, wherein the respective features are defined as follows: where N is a number of sample data points, xn is a power consumption value of an nth point, σ is the standard deviation, an is a magnitude of the energy at an nth frequency fn after frequency domain transformation, s is the spectrum mean, Vs is the spectrum variance, z(n) is a weighted frequency value, and y(n) represents a center frequency of a sample point.
3. The method of defending against inaudible attacks on voice assistant based on machine learning according to claim 1, wherein the "performing training and generating a detection model for detecting a malicious voice command" in step 4) comprises: selecting a machine learning algorithm to perform training and generating a detection model for detecting a malicious voice command.
4. The method of defending against inaudible attacks on voice assistant based on machine learning according to claim 1, wherein generation of the collected negative sample in the step 1) comprises: modulating, by a signal generator, a voice of the positive sample to an ultrasound band, playing it out through an ultrasonic speaker, in which a modulation manner is an amplitude modulation, a modulation depth is 100% and a carrier frequency is within a range of 20-45 kHz; and then, recording malicious voice signals, which are obtained by demodulating, as the data of the negative sample.
5. The method of defending against inaudible attacks on voice assistant based on machine learning according to claim 1, wherein the data segmentation comprises: segmenting obtained sound data by a length of 20 ms; and then determining that a beginning position of a first segment is a beginning position of an entire sentence if signal intensities E=Σi=0nx12 of four consecutive segments are larger than a threshold, where xi is a value of an ith data point, and determining that the beginning position of the first segment is an end position of the entire sentence if the signal intensities of the four consecutive segments are smaller than the threshold; and then segmenting the voice command based on the beginning position and the end position.
