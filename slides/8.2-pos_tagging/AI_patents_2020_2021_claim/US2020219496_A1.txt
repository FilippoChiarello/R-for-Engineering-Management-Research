<title>
Methods and systems for managing voice response systems based on signals from external devices
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments for managing a voice response system by one or more processors are described. At least one sound is detected. A signal that is representative of at least a portion of the at least one detected sound is received. A voice communication is determined based on the at least one detected sound and the signal. A response to the determined voice communication is determined.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method, by one or more processors, for managing a voice response system comprising: detecting at least one sound; receiving a signal that is representative of at least a portion of the at least one detected sound; determining a voice communication based on the at least one detected sound and the signal; and determining a response to the determined voice communication.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising causing the determined response to be executed by a computing device.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the determined response includes at least one of adjusting the operation of the computing device and generating a reply communication to the determined voice communication.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one detected sound includes a human generated sound and a non-human generated sound.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the signal and the non-human generated sound are generated by an external device, and the signal is representative of the non-human generated sound.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the determining of the voice communication includes filtering the at least one detected sound based on the signal.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one detected sound includes a non-human generated sound that includes the determined voice communication.
8. A system for managing a voice response system comprising: at least one processor that detects at least one sound; receives a signal that is representative of at least a portion of the at least one detected sound; determines a voice communication based on the at least one detected sound and the signal; and determines a response to the determined voice communication.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the at least one processor further causes the determined response to be executed by a computing device.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the determined response includes at least one of adjusting the operation of the computing device and generating a reply communication to the determined voice communication.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the at least one detected sound includes a human generated sound and a non-human generated sound.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the signal and the non-human generated sound are generated by an external device, and the signal is representative of the non-human generated sound.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the determining of the voice communication includes filtering the at least one detected sound based on the signal.
14. The system of claim 8, wherein the at least one detected sound includes a non-human generated sound that includes the determined voice communication.
15. A computer program product for managing a voice response system by one or more processors, the computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable program code portions stored therein, the computer-readable program code portions comprising: an executable portion that detects at least one sound; an executable portion that receives a signal that is representative of at least a portion of the at least one detected sound; an executable portion that determines a voice communication based on the at least one detected sound and the signal; and an executable portion that determines a response to the determined voice communication.
16. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the computer-readable program code portions further include an executable portion that causes the determined response to be executed by a computing device.
17. The computer program product of claim 16, wherein the determined response includes at least one of adjusting the operation of the computing device and generating a reply communication to the determined voice communication.
18. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the at least one detected sound includes a human generated sound and a non-human generated sound.
19. The computer program product of claim 18, wherein the signal and the non-human generated sound are generated by an external device, and the signal is representative of the non-human generated sound.
20. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the determining of the voice communication includes filtering the at least one detected sound based on the signal.
21. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the at least one detected sound includes a non-human generated sound that includes the determined voice communication.
