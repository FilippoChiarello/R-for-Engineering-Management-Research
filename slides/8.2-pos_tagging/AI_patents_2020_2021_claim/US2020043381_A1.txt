DISPLAY DEVICE AND MANUFACTURING METHOD THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
A plurality of display panels having a curved surface are placed in a limited space. Two, or three or more display panels are combined to form one display region having a T-shaped outer edge as one screen, and a driver can curve part of the display panel as appropriate so that the driver can see the screen easily. A first display panel or a second display panel has flexibility and includes a position adjustment function of curving an end portion. That is, by curving part of the display panel, the user can see the display panel easily. The in-car design can also be varied.

<claims>
1. A display device comprising: a first display panel, a second display panel, and a third display panel, wherein the first display panel comprises a first region and a second region, wherein the second display panel comprises a third region and a fourth region, wherein the third display panel comprises a fifth region and a sixth region, wherein the first region, the third region, and the fifth region are each configured to transmit visible light, wherein the second region, the fourth region, and the sixth region are each configured to perform display, wherein in a first portion, the first region of the first display panel and the fourth region of the second display panel overlap with each other, wherein in a second portion, the fifth region of the third display panel and the second region of the first display panel overlap with each other, wherein in a third portion, the fifth region of the third display panel and the fourth region of the second display panel overlap with each other, and wherein a display region comprising the second region, the fourth region, and the sixth region has a substantial T-shape.
2. The display device according to claim 1, wherein in a fourth portion, the fifth region of the third display panel, the third region of the second display panel, and the first region of the first display panel overlap with one another, and wherein the fourth portion is placed between the second portion and the third portion.
3. The display device according to claim 1, wherein one of the first display panel and the second display panel is flexible and comprises an adjustment function of curving an end portion.
4. The display device according to claim 1, further comprising: a first terminal portion on a short side of the first display panel; and a second terminal portion on a long side of the second display panel, wherein connection position of a first external terminal connected to the first terminal portion and connection position of a second external terminal connected to the second terminal portion are different from each other.
5. The display device according to claim 1, wherein a display area of the first display panel and a display area of the second display panel are the same.
6. The display device according to claim 1, wherein the first display panel comprises an organic light-emitting element.
7. A display device comprising: a display panel comprising an organic light-emitting element over a flexible film; an optical film over the display panel; and a position adjustment jig below a portion in which the optical film and the flexible film overlap with each other, a position control jig configured to curve an end portion of the display panel, wherein both the optical film and the flexible film are curved by a driving mechanism of the position control jig.
