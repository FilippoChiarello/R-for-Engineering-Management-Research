Vehicle driving assist system with enhanced data processing
</title>

<abstract>
A driving assistance system for a vehicle includes a processor of the vehicle operable to process data for the driving assistance system. The driving assistance system determines a priority for various processing tasks required by one or more systems of the vehicle. Responsive to the determination of the priority of various processing tasks required by one or more systems of the vehicle, the processor determines a task with a higher priority than other lower priority tasks and is operable to process the higher priority task and to shift processing of lower priority tasks to other processors within the vehicle.

<claims>
1. A driving assistance system for a vehicle, said driving assistance system comprising: a forward viewing camera disposed at an in-cabin side of a windshield of the vehicle; wherein said forward viewing camera comprises an imager having at least one million photosensor elements; an electronic control unit (ECU) disposed at the vehicle, said ECU operable to process data for said driving assistance system; wherein image data captured by said forward viewing camera is provided to and is received at said ECU; wherein said ECU processes the image data to detect an object in a path of travel of the vehicle; wherein said ECU performs processing tasks for vehicle systems of the vehicle; wherein said ECU processes the image data for processing tasks for at least one vehicle system selected from the group consisting of (i) a headlamp control system of the vehicle, (ii) a collision avoidance system of the vehicle, (iii) a traffic sign recognition system of the vehicle and (iv) a lane departure warning system of the vehicle; wherein, responsive to determination of respective priorities of the processing tasks, processing tasks with a higher priority are determined to be higher priority tasks and processing tasks with a lower priority are determined to be lower priority tasks; and wherein, responsive to determination that one of the vehicle systems requires safety critical processing, (i) processing by said ECU for that vehicle system is determined to be one of the higher priority tasks, (ii) said ECU performs safety critical processing for the higher priority task and (iii) lower priority tasks are shifted from said ECU to other processors within the vehicle so that said ECU maximizes safety critical processing for the higher priority task.
2. The driving assistance system of claim 1, wherein said ECU is operable to upload data to the cloud for processing by a remote processor.
3. The driving assistance system of claim 2, wherein said ECU uploads the data pertaining to at least one determined lower priority task of the determined lower priority tasks to the cloud for processing by the remote processor.
4. The driving assistance system of claim 1, wherein said ECU determines underutilized processors of the vehicle and causes at least one underutilized processor of the determined underutilized processors to process data pertaining to a determined lower priority task of the determined lower priority tasks.
5. The driving assistance system of claim 1, wherein the safety critical processing is for detecting the object in a predicted path of travel of the vehicle, and wherein the vehicle system associated with the safety critical processing comprises the collision avoidance system of the vehicle.
6. The driving assistance system of claim 1, wherein said ECU and the other processors communicate with one another via a communication network of the vehicle.
7. A driving assistance system for a vehicle, said driving assistance system comprising: a forward viewing camera disposed at an in-cabin side of a windshield of the vehicle; wherein said forward viewing camera comprises an imager having at least one million photosensor elements; an electronic control unit (ECU) disposed at the vehicle, said ECU operable to process data for said driving assistance system; wherein image data captured by said forward viewing camera is provided to and is received at said ECU; wherein said ECU processes the image data to detect an object in a path of travel of the vehicle; wherein said ECU performs processing tasks for vehicle systems of the vehicle; wherein said ECU processes the image data for processing tasks for at least one vehicle system selected from the group consisting of (i) a headlamp control system of the vehicle, (ii) a collision avoidance system of the vehicle, (iii) a traffic sign recognition system of the vehicle and (iv) a lane departure warning system of the vehicle; wherein, responsive to determination of respective priorities of the processing tasks, processing tasks with a higher priority are determined to be higher priority tasks and processing tasks with a lower priority are determined to be lower priority tasks; wherein, responsive to determination that one of the vehicle systems requires safety critical processing, (i) processing by said ECU for that vehicle system is determined to be one of the higher priority tasks, (ii) said ECU performs safety critical processing for the higher priority task and (iii) lower priority tasks are shifted from said ECU to other processors within the vehicle so that said ECU maximizes safety critical processing for the higher priority task; and wherein said ECU (i) uploads data pertaining to a determined lower priority task of the determined lower priority tasks to the cloud for processing by a remote processor, or (ii) determines underutilized processors of the vehicle and causes an underutilized processor of the determined underutilized processors to process data pertaining to another determined lower priority task of the determined lower priority tasks.
8. A driving assistance system for a vehicle, said driving assistance system comprising: a forward viewing camera disposed at an in-cabin side of a windshield of the vehicle; wherein said forward viewing camera comprises an imager having at least one million photosensor elements; an electronic control unit (ECU) disposed at the vehicle, said ECU operable to process data for said driving assistance system; wherein image data captured by said forward viewing camera is provided to and is received at said ECU; wherein said ECU processes the image data to detect an object in a path of travel of the vehicle; wherein said ECU performs processing tasks for vehicle systems of the vehicle; wherein said ECU processes the image data for processing tasks for at least one system selected from the group consisting of (i) a headlamp control system of the vehicle, (ii) a collision avoidance system of the vehicle, (iii) a traffic sign recognition system of the vehicle and (iv) a lane departure warning system of the vehicle; wherein, responsive to determination of respective priorities of the processing tasks, processing tasks with a higher priority are determined to be higher priority tasks and processing tasks with a lower priority are determined to be lower priority tasks; wherein, responsive to determination that one of the vehicle systems requires safety critical processing, (i) processing by said ECU for that vehicle system is determined to be one of the higher priority tasks, (ii) said ECU performs safety critical processing for the higher priority task and (iii) lower priority tasks are shifted from said ECU to other processors within the vehicle so that said ECU maximizes safety critical processing for the higher priority task; wherein said ECU and the other processors communicate with one another via a communication network of the vehicle; wherein said ECU determines underutilized processors of the vehicle and causes at least one underutilized processor of the determined underutilized processors to process data pertaining to a determined lower priority task of the determined lower priority tasks; and wherein the safety critical processing is for detecting the object in a predicted path of travel of the vehicle, and wherein the vehicle system associated with the safety critical processing comprises the collision avoidance system of the vehicle.
9. The driving assistance system of claim 8, wherein said ECU is operable to upload the data to the cloud for processing by a remote processor.
