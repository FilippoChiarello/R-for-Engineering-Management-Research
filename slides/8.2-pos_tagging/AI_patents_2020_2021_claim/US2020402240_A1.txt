ADAPTED SCANNING WINDOW IN IMAGE FRAME OF SENSOR FOR OBJECT DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
A scanning window is used to scan an image frame of a sensor when doing object detection. In one approach, positions within the image frame are stored in memory. Each position corresponds to an object detection at that position for a prior frame of data. A first area of the image frame is determined based on the stored positions. When starting to analyze a new frame of data, the first area is scanned to detect at least one object. After scanning within the first area, at least one other area of the new image frame is scanned.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: storing, in memory, positions within an image frame, each position corresponding to an object detection; determining a first area of the image frame, wherein the determination is based on the stored positions; scanning within the first area to detect at least one object; and after scanning within the first area, scanning within at least one other area of the image frame.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein scanning within the first area comprises scanning by incrementing a position of a scanning window within the first area, the method further comprising determining whether an object is detected at each incremented position of the scanning window.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein each of the stored positions includes a pair of respective positions on a first axis and a second axis, and determining the first area comprises determining, using the stored positions, a maximum position on the first axis, and a minimum position on the second axis.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the first axis is a vertical axis, and the second axis is a horizontal axis.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the image frame is a frame for image data collected by a camera mounted to an autonomous vehicle, and the camera is configured to provide data for controlling navigation of the vehicle.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein scanning within the first area includes scanning by incrementing a position of a scanning window, and detecting a first object at a first position of the scanning window in the image frame.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the stored positions are determined using data collected from one or more prior images, and scanning within the first area uses data collected from a current image.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the first area comprises determining borders for the first area using vertical positions and horizontal positions corresponding to the stored positions.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the borders comprise an upper border and a side border, the upper border is determined based on a maximum value of the vertical positions, and the side border is determined based on a minimum value of the horizontal positions.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein scanning within the first area includes scanning using a scanning window having a vertical size, the borders further comprise a lower border, and the lower border is determined based a minimum value of the vertical positions less the vertical size of the scanning window.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein each position is stored in response to an object detection associated with a scanning window, and the stored position is a current position of the scanning window when the object detection occurs.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein a number of the positions stored in the memory is limited to a predetermined maximum, and determining the first area of the image frame is based on a number of the stored positions that is equal to or less than the predetermined maximum.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising, when the number of positions stored in the memory reaches the predetermined maximum, replacing one of the stored positions with a new position of the scanning window.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein for a predetermined time period, the at least one other area is associated with a total number of object detections that is less than a total number of object detections associated with the first area.
15. A system comprising: at least one processing device; and memory containing instructions configured to instruct the at least one processing device to: store positions within an image frame of a sensor, each position corresponding to an object detection based on data collected by the sensor; select a first area of a plurality of areas of the image frame, wherein the first area is selected using the stored positions and based on a level of object detection activity associated with each of the areas; and scan data collected within the first area for a current image, the scanning to detect at least one object within the first area.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the first area has a level of object detection activity greater than a respective level of object detection activity for each the other areas.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein the stored positions correspond to data collected for at least one prior image.
18. The system of claim 15, wherein scanning the data comprises analyzing, using a computer model, at least a portion of the data collected within the first area.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein the computer model comprises a neural network.
20. A non-transitory computer storage medium storing instructions which, when executed on at least one processing device, cause the at least one processing device to at least: store positions corresponding to collection of data by a sensor, each position associated with an object detection, and the sensor configured to collect data from a plurality of regions; select a first region of the plurality of regions, wherein the first region is selected based on the stored positions; and scan data collected within the first region, the scanning to detect at least one object within the first region.
