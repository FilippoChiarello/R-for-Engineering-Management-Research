METHODS AND APPARATUSES FOR GUIDING COLLECTION OF ULTRASOUND DATA USING MOTION AND/OR ORIENTATION DATA
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of technology described herein relate to guiding collection of ultrasound data collection using motion and/or orientation data. A directional indicator corresponding to an instruction for moving an ultrasound imaging device relative to a subject may be displayed in an augmented reality display. The direction of the directional indicator in the augmented reality display may be independent of an orientation of the ultrasound imaging device. The augmented reality display may include video captured by a camera that depicts the ultrasound imaging device and a fiducial marker on the ultrasound imaging device. The direction of the directional indicator may be based on the pose of the camera relative to the fiducial marker and the rotation and/or tilt of the ultrasound imaging device relative to the axis of gravity. The direction of the directional indicator may also be based on the pose of the camera relative to the subject.

1. 1-20. (canceled)
21. A method, comprising: receiving an instruction to move an ultrasound device in a particular direction relative to a subject; determining an orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the subject; and displaying, in a video displayed on a processing device in operative communication with the ultrasound device, a directional indicator relative to the ultrasound device, wherein displaying the directional indicator comprises adjusting for the orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the subject such that the directional indicator continues to point approximately in the particular direction relative to the subject.
22. The method of claim 21, wherein the video is captured by a camera on the processing device.
23. The method of claim 21, wherein displaying the directional indicator comprises superimposing the directional indicator on the video such that the directional indicator appears to be in a real-world environment of the video.
24. The method of claim 21, wherein determining the orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the subject comprises determining an orientation of the ultrasound device relative to gravity.
25. The method of claim 24, wherein determining the orientation of the ultrasound device relative to gravity comprises using an accelerometer on the ultrasound device.
26. The method of claim 21, wherein receiving the instruction to move the ultrasound device in the particular direction relative to the subject comprises determining the instruction using a statistical model.
27. The method of claim 21, further comprising receiving ultrasound data from the ultrasound device, and wherein determining the instruction to move the ultrasound device in the particular direction relative to the subject is based on the ultrasound data.
28. The method of claim 21, wherein the ultrasound device is initially in a default orientation relative to the subject.
29. The method of claim 28, wherein the default orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the subject is based on an orientation marking on the ultrasound device.
30. The method of claim 28, wherein adjusting for the orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the subject comprises subtracting a change in orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the subject from the default orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the subject.
31. An apparatus, comprising: a processing device in operative communication with an ultrasound device and configured to: receive an instruction to move an ultrasound device in a particular direction relative to a subject; determine an orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the subject; and display, in a video displayed on a processing device in operative communication with the ultrasound device, a directional indicator relative to the ultrasound device, wherein the processing device is configured, when displaying the directional indicator, to adjust for the orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the subject such that the directional indicator continues to point approximately in the particular direction relative to the subject.
32. The apparatus of claim 31, wherein the processing device is further configured to capture the video with a camera on the processing device.
33. The apparatus of claim 31, wherein the processing device is configured, when displaying the directional indicator, to superimpose the directional indicator on the video such that the directional indicator appears to be in a real-world environment of the video.
34. The apparatus of claim 31, wherein the processing device is configured, when determining the orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the subject, to determine an orientation of the ultrasound device relative to gravity.
35. The apparatus of claim 34, wherein the processing device is configured, when determining the orientation of the ultrasound device relative to gravity, to use an accelerometer on the ultrasound device.
36. The apparatus of claim 31, wherein the processing device is configured, when receiving the instruction to move the ultrasound device in the particular direction relative to the subject, to determine the instruction using a statistical model.
37. The apparatus of claim 31, wherein the processing device is further configured to receive ultrasound data from the ultrasound device and determine the instruction to move the ultrasound device in the particular direction relative to the subject based on the ultrasound data.
38. The apparatus of claim 31, wherein the ultrasound device is initially in a default orientation relative to the subject.
39. The apparatus of claim 38, wherein the default orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the subject is based on an orientation marking on the ultrasound device.
40. The apparatus of claim 38, wherein the processing device is configured, when adjusting for the orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the subject, to subtract a change in orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the subject from the default orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the subject.
