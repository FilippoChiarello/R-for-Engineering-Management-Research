<title>
Methods and systems for rapid screening of mild traumatic brain injury
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosure provides for easy, reliable, and rapid screening of a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) based on a modeling of a subject's tracking of a dynamic target during the course of a simple motor tracking task. The gathered tracking data can be used to calculate tracking errors between the subject's actual input (e.g., grip force) and the intended target input. The tracking errors may be used to generate numerical values for model parameters that correlate the subject's responses to the tracking errors during the course of the dynamic motor tracking task. A classification model may be used to compare the model values to multi-subject model values of known diagnoses for mTBI. The entire screening process can be effectively administered in a matter of minutes or less, and with a high degree of accuracy.

<claims>
1. A system for screening of a brain injury, the system comprising: a display screen that displays an image of a dynamic target for a subject to track using a sensing component and an image of a tracker representing the subject's tracking of the dynamic target; a data acquisition unit that receives, from the sensing component, tracking data representing the subject's tracking of the dynamic target; a parameter generating unit that determines, based on target data and the tracking data, a model value indicative of the subject's corrective actions in response to deviations between the tracker and the dynamic target over a period of time; a memory that contains multi-subject model values; and a comparison unit that compares the model value to the multi-subject model values to determine a likelihood that the subject has a brain injury, wherein the system generates a screening indicator representing the determined likelihood that the subject has a brain injury.
2. A system for screening of a brain injury comprising: a sensing component configured to detect and transmit tracking data representing a subject's tracking of a dynamic target on a display; an electronic device in communication with the sensing component, the electronic device including a display, one or more processors, and a memory storing one or more programs that when executed by the one or more processors cause the one or more processors to: display on the display an image of a dynamic target for a subject to track using the sensing component; receive, from the sensing component, tracking data representing the subject's tracking of the dynamic target; display on the display, in real time, an image of a tracker on the display representing the subject's tracking of the dynamic target; determine a model value derived from the tracking data and indicative of the subject's corrective actions in response to deviations between the tracker and the dynamic target over a period of time; compare the model value to multi-subject model values; and output a screening indicator representing the likelihood that the subject has a brain injury based on the compared model values.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the one or more processors are further caused to: compare the model value to a corresponding prior model value of the subject; and output a prior screening indicator representing a recovery progress of the subject from a brain injury based on the comparison between the model values.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the prior screening indicator comprises a screening indicator of the subject from a threshold amount of time prior to the current time.
5. The system of claim 2, wherein the brain injury is a mild traumatic brain injury.
6. The system of claim 2, wherein the electronic device comprises a portable device.
7. The system of claim 2, wherein the one or more processors are further caused to: move the displayed dynamic target in accordance with one or more of a plurality of target modes, and each of the target modes instructs the dynamic target to move in a unique pattern.
8. The system of claim 2, wherein the sensing component is a dynamometer that detects the subject's hand grip force.
9. The system of claim 2, wherein the sensing component is an eye-tracking device.
10. The system of claim 2, wherein to display the image of a tracker, the one or more processors are further caused to: display the tracker as an icon on the display that expands and contracts in response to the subject's input using the sensing component.
11. The system of claim 2, wherein to determine the model value derived from the tracking data, the one or more processors are further caused to: determine the model value via a response model that correlates the deviations between the tracker and the dynamic target to the subject's corrective actions over a period of time.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the model value comprises one or more best-fit parameters representing optimized fit values quantified by the response model using the tracking data.
13. The system of claim 2, wherein the one or more multi-subject model values comprise one or more model values of previously tested subjects.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the previously tested subjects comprise individuals known to have a brain injury and individuals known not to have a brain injury.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the previously tested subjects comprise individuals having two or more of gender, height, weight, and age group in common with the subject.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the previously tested subjects comprise individuals employed in the same field of employment as the subject.
17. The system of claim 2, wherein to compare the model value to the one or more multi-subject model values, the one or more processors are further caused to: implement a machine learning predictor that uses a Gaussian process.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein to compare the model value to the one or more multi-subject model values, the one or more processors are further caused to: compare a plurality of assessment scores of the subject to a plurality of assessment scores of multiple subjects from the multi-subject model.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein the plurality of assessment scores of the multiple subjects comprise evaluative scores from post-concussion questionnaires.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein to output the screening indicator, the one or more processors are further caused to: display at least one of a light in one or more colors, an audio signal, or text.
