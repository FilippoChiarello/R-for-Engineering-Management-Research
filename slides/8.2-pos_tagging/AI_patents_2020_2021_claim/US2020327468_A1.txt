</title>

<abstract>
Provided is a computer-implemented method for determining a parking schedule, including receiving, with at least one processor, data associated with a first parking schedule involving a first vehicle; generating, with at least one processor, a facility parking schedule based on the first parking schedule and one or more identifiers corresponding to one or more parking spaces in a parking garage; receiving, with at least one processor, a second parking schedule involving a second vehicle different from the first vehicle. Computer-implemented methods may also include determining, with at least one processor, whether a conflict exists based on the facility parking schedule and the second parking schedule. Systems and computer program products are also provided.
