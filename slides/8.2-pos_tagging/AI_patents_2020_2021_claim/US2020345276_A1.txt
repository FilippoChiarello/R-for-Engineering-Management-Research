<title>
DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF HEAD IMPACTS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided for determining an acceleration at a location of interest within one of a user's head and neck. At least one of linear acceleration data, angular acceleration data, angular velocity data, and orientation data is produced using at least one sensing device substantially rigidly attached to an ambient-accessible surface of the user's head. The location of interest is represented relative to a position of the at least one sensing device as a time-varying function. An acceleration at the location of interest is calculated as a function of the data produced at the sensing device and the time-varying function representing the location of interest. The calculated acceleration at the location of interest is provided to at least one of the user and an observer in a human-perceptible form.

<claims>
1. 1-27. (canceled)
28. A head impact monitor system, comprising: a mouthpiece; a plurality of sensors each arranged on the mouthpiece, defining a sensor location, and configured to generate sensor data responsive to an impact; a data transform component comprising computer-implemented instructions stored thereon and operable by a processor to: receive the sensor data from the plurality of sensors; extract an impact vector from the sensor data; translate the impact vector from the sensor location to another location on a head of a user to establish a translated vector; and assess the translated vector.
29. The system of claim 28, wherein the mouthpiece is one of a mouth guard and a lip guard worn by the user.
30. The system of claim 28, wherein the another location is a center of gravity of the head of the user.
31. The system of claim 28, wherein the location of interest is a location within one of a frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, pons, thalamus, gyrus, fornix, amygdyla, hippocampus, cranium, facial bones, maxilla, mandible, cerebrospinal fluid, occipito-cervical junction, cervical spine, vertebral bodies, spinal cord, spinal nerves, spinal vessels, basal ganglia, peri-vascular spaces, septum, white-gray matter junctions, bridging veins, corpus callosum, fissure, cavity sinus, meninges, falx, dura, arachnoid, and pia matter of the user.
32. The system of claim 28, wherein assess the translated vector further comprises determining at least one of a Gadd Severity Index, a von Mises stress, and a Head Injury Criterion from the calculated acceleration.
33. The system of claim 28, wherein assess the translated vector comprises calculating one of an impact force, a strain rate, and a loading rate at the another location from the translated vector.
34. The system of claim 28, wherein extract an impact vector comprises extract an angular acceleration and wherein assess the translated vector comprises calculate one of an angular jerk at the another location and an angular momentum of the user's head based on the extracted angular acceleration.
35. The system of claim 28, wherein assess the translated vector comprises calculate one of a Generalized Acceleration Model for Brain Injury Threshold, a relative motion damage measure, a dilatational damage measure, and a neck injury criterion.
36. The system of claim 1, wherein assessing the translated vector comprises calculate one of a Head Impact Power parameter, a weighted principle component score, a strain energy, and a cumulative strain damage measure.
37. The system of claim 1, wherein assess the translated vector comprises calculate one of a peak pressure, a principal strain, a sheer stress, and a product of a strain and a strain rate.
38. The system of claim 28, wherein the mouthpiece comprises multiple layers of material and the plurality of sensors is arranged in one of the multiple layers in an elongate pattern.
39. The system of claim 28, further comprising a wireless transmitter configured to communicate the sensor data to the data transform component.
40. The system of claim 28, further comprising an on-board wired transmitter with data storage for communicating the sensor data to the data transform component.
