<title>
A Thermoresponsive Hydrogel
</title>

<abstract>
This invention relates to thermoresponsive hydrogels. Particularly, the invention relates to a thermoresponsive hydrogel comprising copolymer polyethylene glycol (PEG)-polycaprolactone (PCL)-polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polypropylene fumerate (PPF). The thermoresponsive hydrogel may further comprise a poloxamer, particularly Pluronic F-127. The invention extends to a method of manufacturing thermoresponsive hydrogels, also extends to an ink for a three dimensional (3D) printer including the thermoresponsive hydrogels. The invention further extends to a thermoresponsive hydrogel for use in the treatment of a bone injury and/or a bone defect, and/or to a method of treating a bone injury and/or a bone defect. The thermoresponsive hydrogels may include dispersed therein an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), preferably an API falling in the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class II, further preferably a statin type drug, most preferably simvastatin.

<claims>
1. A thermoresponsive hydrogel comprising a polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone-polyethylene glycol (PEG-PCL-PEG) copolymer, polypropylene fumarate (PPF); and a poloxamer (POL), wherein the PEG-PCL-PEG: PPF thermoresponsive hydrogel is reversibly thermoresponsive across a temperature range transitioning from a sol (liquid) state, at about 20° C. or below about 20° C., to a gel (semi-solid) state, at about human body temperature (36.5° C.) or above human body temperature (36.5° C.).
2. The thermoresponsive hydrogel according to claim 1, wherein the poloxamer is Pluronic F-127 (PF127) therein providing a PEG-PCL-PEG:PPF:PF127 thermoresponsive hydrogel.
3. The thermoresponsive hydrogel according to claim 2, further comprising an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dispersed therein.
4. The thermoresponsive hydrogel according to claim 3, wherein the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is an API falling in the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class II.
5. The thermoresponsive hydrogel according to claim 4, wherein the API of BCS class II include statins, preferably simvastatin or rosuvastatin.
6. A method of manufacturing the thermoresponsive hydrogel according to claim 1, the method comprising the following steps: (i). mixing ε-caprolactone (CL) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) together Under inert conditions in the presence of a catalyst to form, via free radical polymerization, a first reaction mixture including a polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone-polyethylene glycol (PEG-PCL-PEG) copolymer; (ii). adding polypropylene fumarate (PPF) to the first reaction mixture Forming a second reaction mixture; and (iii). Mixing a poloxamer (POL) into the second reaction mixture to form a third reaction mixture including the thermoresponsive hydrogel according to claim 1.
7. The method according to claim 6, wherein the poloxamer is Pluronic F-127 (PF127).
8. The method according to claim 7, wherein the catalyst is stannous octoate (Sn(Oct)2).
9. The method according to claim 8, wherein mixing of Step (i) takes place at about 125° C. for between 4 and 8 hours, preferably for 6 hours, and wherein Step (ii) takes place at about 140° C. for between 4 and 8 hours, preferably for 6 hours.
10. The thermoresponsive hydrogel according to claim 1 for use in the treatment of bone injury and/or bone defects.
11. The thermoresponsive hydrogel for use according to claim 10, wherein the thermoresponsive hydrogel is for administration by injection in the sol (liquid) state at a site of bone injury and/or bone defect in a human or animal body, and wherein said injected thermoresponsive hydrogel transitions to a gel (semi-solid) state at said site.
12. An ink for a three dimensional printing device, the ink comprising the thermoresponsive hydrogel according to claim 1.
