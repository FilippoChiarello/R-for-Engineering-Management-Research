IDENTIFICATION OF NATURAL FRACTURES IN WELLBORE IMAGES USING MACHINE LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
A system, method and program product for processing borehole images to delineate between natural fractures and induced fractures. A system is disclosed that includes: an image analysis platform that inputs a noisy image from a borehole, processes the image using a set of filtering strategies, and renders a set of suggested filtered images via a user interface, the user interface including a mechanism for allowing a user to choose a selected filtered image from the set of suggested filtered images that best delineates between natural fractures and induced fractures, and wherein the image analysis platform further includes a feedback system for packaging and outputting the noisy image and selected filtered image as feedback; and a learning platform having a knowledge registration system that collects and stores training data and the feedback and in a knowledgebase, and a machine learning system that generates filtering strategies.
