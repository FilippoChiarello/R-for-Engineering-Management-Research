<title>
Systems and methods for determining the probability of a pregnancy at a selected point in time
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention generally relates to systems and methods for determining the probability of a pregnancy at a selected point in time. Systems and methods of the invention employ an algorithm that has been trained on a reference set of data from a plurality of women for whom at least one of fertility-associated phenotypic traits, fertility-associated medical interventions, or pregnancy outcomes are known, in which the algorithm accounts for any woman who ceases pregnancy attempts prior to reaching a live birth outcome.

<claims>
1. A method for determining a probability of achieving a pregnancy at a selected point in time, the method comprising: training a prognosis predictor, using training data from a population that includes women who ceased pregnancy attempts after one or more reproductive cycles without conception and women who continued pregnancy attempts until live birth, to determine a correlation between fertility-associated characteristics and known pregnancy outcomes, the fertility-associated characteristics comprising phenotypic traits, fertility-associated interventions, and pregnancy outcomes; accepting as input, data representative of a plurality of fertility-associated phenotypic traits of a female subject; analyzing the input data using the prognosis predictor; providing, based on the analysis, a probability of achieving a pregnancy at a selected point in time; and treating the female subject with a fertility treatment based on the probability of achieving a pregnancy.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the pregnancy of the female subject results in a live birth.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein said fertility-associated traits are adjusted per pre-specified time interval or fertility-associated medical intervention.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein said input data are obtained from at least one selected from the group consisting of: a questionnaire, a medical history of said subject, a family medical history of said subject, and a combination thereof.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein said input data are obtained by analyzing a sample collected from a person selected from the group consisting of: said female subject, intimate partners of said subject, blood-related relatives of said subject, gamete donors, embryo donors, gestational carriers, and a combination thereof.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein said sample is a human tissue or bodily fluid.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the input data further comprises fertility-associated genotypic traits of the female subject.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the training data further comprises fertility-associated genotypic traits.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the genotypic traits of the subject are obtained by conducting an assay on a sample from the subject to determine the presence or absence of a genetic variation that is associated with infertility.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the assay is selected from the group consisting of: sequencing, hybridization to an array, and an amplification reaction.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the genetic variation is selected from the group consisting of: a single nucleotide polymorphism, a deletion, an insertion, a rearrangement, a copy number variation, and a combination thereof.
12. The method of claim 7, wherein the genotypic traits are reflective of expression levels of one or more fertility-associated genes.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the fertility-associated phenotypic traits comprise a trait selected from Table 1.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the input data further comprises a plurality of fertility-associated phenotypic traits of a male subject.
15. A method for determining a probability of achieving a pregnancy at a selected point in time, the method comprising: using at least one computer to train a prognosis predictor using training data from a population that includes women who ceased pregnancy attempts after one or more reproductive cycles without conception and women who continued pregnancy attempts until live birth, to determine a correlation between fertility-associated characteristics and known pregnancy outcomes, the fertility-associated characteristics comprising phenotypic traits, fertility-associated interventions, and pregnancy outcomes; inputting data representative of a plurality of fertility-associated phenotypic traits of a female subject into the at least one computer; analyzing the input data using the prognosis predictor; causing the at least one computer to provide a probability of achieving a pregnancy at a selected point in time based on the analysis; and treating the female subject with a fertility treatment based on the probability of achieving a pregnancy.
