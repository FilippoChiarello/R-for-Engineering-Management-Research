SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR CLASSIFYING SOUNDS
</title>

<abstract>
An electronic device has one or more microphones that pick up a sound. At least one feature extractor processes the audio signals from the microphones, that contain the picked up the sound, to determine several features for the sound. The electronic device also includes a classifier that has a machine learning model which is configured to determine a sound classification, such as artificial versus natural for the sound, based upon at least one of the determined features. Other aspects are also described and claimed.

<claims>
1. An electronic device, comprising: one or more microphones configured to receive a sound; a processor and memory having stored therein a plurality of instructions that when executed by the processor implement at least one feature detector configured to receive one or more audio signals from the microphones that contain the sound, process the audio signals to determine a plurality of features for the audio signals including a directional feature and a sound class feature; and a sound classifier including a machine learning model that is configured to receive the determined features from the at least one feature detector, and determine a sound classification for the audio signal based upon at least one of the determined features.
2. The electronic device according to claim 1, wherein the electronic device performs one or more functions or actions based upon the determined sound classification.
3. The electronic device according to claim 1, wherein the sound classifier determines whether the sound is a natural sound versus an artificial sound.
4. The electronic device according to claim 1, wherein if the sound classifier determines that the sound is a natural sound, then the device is allowed to perform one or more actions or functions based on the sound, and wherein if the sound classification module determines that the sound is an artificial sound, the device is prevented from performing those one or more actions or functions based on the sound.
5. The electronic device according to claim 1, wherein the plurality of features includes at least three features including a distortion feature.
6. The electronic device according to claim 1, wherein the machine learning model includes a neural network.
7. The electronic device according to claim 1, wherein the device is a smart phone, a smart speaker, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, or a desktop computer.
8. The electronic device according to claim 1, wherein the sound classifier accesses a database that stores historical sound data, and wherein the sound classifier determines the classification based upon the historical sound data.
9. The electronic device according to claim 1, further comprising: a wireless communications receiver configured to receive a signal from an additional electronic device indicating that the sound originated from a loudspeaker of the additional electronic device, wherein the sound classification module classifies the sound as an artificial sound responsive to the signal.
10. An electronic device, comprising: a plurality of microphones configured to produce a plurality of audio signals in response to receiving a sound; at least one feature detector configured to receive the plurality of audio signals from the plurality of microphones, and determine a plurality of features relating to the sound including a directional feature, a sound class feature, and a distortion feature; and a classifier including a machine learning model that is configured to receive the determined features, and determine a sound classification for the sound based upon at least one of the determined features, wherein the electronic device performs one or more functions or actions based upon the determined sound classification.
11. The electronic device of claim 10, wherein the classifier determines whether the sound is a natural sound versus an artificial sound.
12. The electronic device according to claim 10, wherein the machine learning model includes a neural network that receives as input all of the audio signals and produces as output the plurality of features.
13. The electronic device according to claim 10, wherein the device is a smart phone, a smart speaker, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, or a desktop computer.
14. The electronic device according to claim 10, wherein the classifier accesses a database storing historical sound data, and wherein the classifier determines the classification based upon the historical sound data.
15. A method performed by a processor of an electronic device for discriminating between two classes of sounds, comprising: capturing a sound using a plurality of microphones, as a recorded sound; digitally processing the recorded sound to determine at least two features of the recorded sound that include a directional feature and a sound class feature; determining a classification of the sound based on the determined features using a machine learning model; and performing a virtual assistant action based upon the determined classification.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the classification is a natural sound versus an artificial sound.
17. The method according to claim 15, wherein the machine-learning model includes a neural network.
18. The method according to claim 15, further comprising: accessing a database that stores historical sound data; and determining the classification of the recorded sound based upon the historical sound data accessed from the database.
19. The method according to claim 15, further comprising: receiving a signal from an additional electronic device wherein the signal indicates that the sound originated from the additional electronic device; and in response to the signal, determining that the sound is an artificial sound.
20. The method according to claim 15, further comprising training the machine learning model by: collecting a data corpus including a variety of labeled natural and artificial sounds; partitioning the data in the data corpus into a training data set and a testing data set; calibrating the machine learning model to classify the data using the training data set; and determining the accuracy of the machine learning model using the testing data set.
