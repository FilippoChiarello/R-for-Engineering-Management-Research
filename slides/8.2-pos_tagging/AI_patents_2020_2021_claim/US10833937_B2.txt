<title>
Detect impact of network maintenance in software defined infrastructure
</title>

<abstract>
A system may assist with checking policy impact in a software-defined infrastructure environment. The system's data analysis may enable it to discover and quantify the impact of policies on software-defined infrastructure objects in the same or different layers.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A server comprising: a processor; and a memory coupled with the processor, the memory storing executable instructions that when executed by the processor cause the processor to effectuate operations comprising: obtaining a policy for maintaining a service; parsing the policy to extract a first object; querying for a second object based on the first object; based on the first object and the second object, determining workload variables exposed by the first object and the second object; and annotating knowledge graph model of the service based on the first object, the second object, and the workload variables.
2. The server of claim 1, the operations further comprising: based on the first object and the second object, determining configurations variables exposed by the first object and the second object.
3. The server of claim 2, wherein the configuration variables comprise number of serving gateways or number packet of data network gateways.
4. The server of claim 2, wherein the configuration variables comprise type of server or number of central processing units for a virtual machine.
5. The server of claim 1, wherein: the first object is a serving gateway, the second object is a mobility management entity.
6. The server of claim 1, wherein: the first object is a serving gateway, and the second object is a virtual network function.
7. The server of claim 1, wherein the first object is a serving gateway.
8. The server of claim 1, wherein: the first object is a network server, and the second object is a virtual machine.
9. The server of claim 1, wherein: the first object is an evolved packet core, and the second object is a packet data network gateway.
10. The server of claim 1, wherein: the first object is network server, and the second object is an eNodeB.
11. The server of claim 1, wherein the workload variables comprise request rate of an evolved packet core or number of clients of an evolved packet core.
12. A computer readable storage medium storing computer executable instructions that when executed by a computing device cause said computing device to effectuate operations comprising: obtaining a policy for maintaining a service; parsing the policy to extract a first object; querying for a second object based on the first object; based on the first object and the second object, determining workload variables exposed by the first object and the second object; and annotating knowledge graph model of the service based on the first object, the second object, and the workload variables.
13. The computer readable storage medium of claim 12, the operations further comprising: based on the first object and the second object, determining configurations variables exposed by the first object and the second object.
14. The computer readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein the configuration variables comprise number of serving gateways or number of packet data network gateways.
15. The computer readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein the configuration variables comprise type of server or number of central processing units for a virtual machine.
16. The computer readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein: the first object is a serving gateway, the second object is a mobility management entity.
17. The computer readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein: the first object is a serving gateway, and the second object is a virtual network function.
18. The computer readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein: the first object is a server, and the second object is a virtual machine.
19. The computer readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein: the first object is an evolved packet core, and the second object is a packet data network gateway.
20. The computer readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein: the first object is server, and the second object is an eNodeB.
