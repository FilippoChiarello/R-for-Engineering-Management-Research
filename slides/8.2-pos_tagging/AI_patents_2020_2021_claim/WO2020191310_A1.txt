</title>

<abstract>
A bot service to enable personalized interactions/communications with a user and a consistent uninterrupted experience with recall from one tech apparatus (e.g., app, device, bot, dash, etc.) to the next.
</abstract>

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method, comprising:
receiving, by a hot service executing on a server computing device, user data, wherein the user data includes data representing an online presence of a user;
analyzing, by the hot service, the user data;
generating, by the hot service, a personality hypothesis for the user based on the analyzed user data;
creating, by the hot service, a user persona for the user based at least in part on the generated personality hypothesis;
creating, by the hot service, a personalized hot for the user based on the user persona, wherein the personalized hot personalizes at least a user interface, a language, a personality, and a user journey specifically to the user; and
continually updating, by the hot service, the personalized hot based on interactions between the personalized hot and the user.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising updating the personalized hot based on interactions between the user and a live agent.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the personalized hot includes one or more machine learning algorithms, and wherein said updating the personalized hot includes updating a model of the machine learning algorithms.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the personality hypothesis includes a Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the user data includes social media data.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the user persona includes a plurality of properties, and wherein each property of the plurality of properties includes a value on a spectrum.
7. A method, comprising: receiving, by a bot service executing on a server computing device, user data from a user;
creating, by the bot service, a user persona for the user based on the received user data;
analyzing, by the bot service, the received user data to determine at least one communication style of the user and at least one learning style of the user;
creating, by the bot service, a personalized bot for the user based on the user persona, the communication style of the user, and the learning style of the user;
filtering interactions between the personalized bot and the user, wherein said filtering comprises altering one or more properties of the interactions such that the interactions are compatible with the user persona, the communication style of the user, and the learning style of the user; and
interacting, by the personalized bot, with the user via the filtered interactions.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising continually updating the personalized bot based on the filtered interactions between the personalized bot and the user.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the personalized bot includes one or more machine learning algorithms, and wherein said updating the personalized bot includes updating a model of the machine learning algorithms.
10. The method of claim 7, further comprising updating the personalized bot based on interactions between the user and a live agent.
11. The method of claim 7, wherein the user data includes social media data.
12. The method of claim 7, wherein the user persona includes a plurality of properties, and wherein each property of the plurality of properties includes a value on a spectrum.
13. The method of claim 7, further comprising providing, by the bot service, a dashboard to the user, wherein the dashboard is operable to present data about information stored and shared by the personalized bot.
14. A system, comprising: at least one processor; and
at least one non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing one or more processor-executable instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, provide a bot service configured to:
receive user data from a user;
create a user persona for the user based on the received user data; analyze the received user data to determine at least one communication style of the user and at least one learning style of the user;
create a personalized bot for the user based on the user persona, the communication style of the user, and the learning style of the user;
filter interactions between the personalized bot and the user, wherein said filtering comprises altering one or more properties of the interactions such that the interactions are compatible with the user persona, the communication style of the user, and the learning style of the user; and
interacting, by the personalized bot, with the user via the filtered interactions.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the bot service is further configured to continually update the personalized bot based on the filtered interactions between the personalized bot and the user.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the personalized bot includes one or more machine learning algorithms, and wherein said updating the personalized bot includes updating a model of the machine learning algorithms.
17. The system of claiml4, wherein the bot service is further configured to update the personalized bot based on interactions between the user and a live agent.
18. The system of claim 14, wherein the user data includes social media data.
19. The system of claim 14, wherein the user persona includes a plurality of properties, and wherein each property of the plurality of properties includes a value on a spectrum.
20. The system of claim 14, wherein the hot service is further configured to provide a dashboard to the user, wherein the dashboard is operable to present data about information stored and shared by the personalized hot.
