MICROZONE HVAC SYSTEM WITH PRECISION AIR DEVICE AND PRECISION AIR AGGREGATOR
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, apparatus and methods for providing personalized comfort to occupants of a conditioned space. A precision air device having a standalone controllable fan with directional nozzles is provided. The precision air device includes environmental and occupancy sensors, and communicates with a user device and with other precision air devices in the space. Application software installed on an occupant's user device enables the occupant to specify whether it is too cold or too warm within his or her personal space, or microzone. The collective demand of all microzones within a VAV macrozone is determined by a precision air aggregator to adjust a controllable VAV damper for that macrozone.

<claims>
1. A microzone HVAC system, comprising: a variable air volume box configured to deliver conditioned air to a macrozone to maintain a temperature of the macrozone according to a first temperature setpoint; at least one precision air device configured to direct the conditioned air at a specified air velocity to a microzone that represents a portion of the macrozone; and a precision air aggregator in operative communication with the variable air volume box and the at least one precision air device and configured to adjust the air velocity of the at least one precision air device to satisfy a user comfort parameter, and wherein in response to determining that the air velocity is above a defined threshold, adjust the variable air volume box to maintain a temperature of the macrozone according to a second temperature that is lower than the first temperature setpoint.
2. The microzone HVAC system in accordance with claim 1, further comprising application software configured for execution on a user device to enable a user to communicate the comfort parameter to the microzone HVAC system.
3. The microzone HVAC system in accordance with claim 2, wherein the application software is further configured to pair the user device to a specific one of the at least one precision air device.
4. The microzone HVAC system in accordance with claim 2, wherein the comfort parameter is selected from the group consisting of a fan speed, a clothing characterization, and a metabolic characterization.
5. The microzone HVAC system in accordance with claim 1, wherein the precision air aggregator is communicatively coupled with the at least one precision air device by a wireless mesh network.
6. The microzone HVAC system in accordance with claim 1, wherein the precision air device comprises: a housing; an air intake; an outlet nozzle; an air mover configured to move air from the air intake to the outlet nozzle; and a controller, comprising: a processor in operative communication with the air mover; a communications interface coupled to the processor; and a memory coupled to the processor storing instructions, which, when executed by the processor, cause the controller to: verify the presence of an occupant; receive, from the communications interface, a target air velocity; and adjust the air mover to deliver the target air velocity from the outlet nozzle.
7. The microzone HVAC system in accordance with claim 6, wherein the precision air device further comprises a nozzle damper operatively associated with the outlet nozzle.
8. The microzone HVAC system in accordance with claim 7, wherein the memory further stores instructions, which, when executed by the processor, cause the controller to adjust nozzle damper to deliver the target air velocity from the outlet nozzle.
9. The microzone HVAC system in accordance with claim 6, wherein the at least one precision air device further comprises means to determine the presence or absence of an occupant in the microzone associated with the precision air device.
10. The microzone HVAC system in accordance with claim 1, wherein the precision air aggregator comprises: a processor; a communications interface coupled to the processor; and a memory coupled to the processor storing instructions, which, when executed by the processor, cause the controller to: receive a comfort index from the at least one precision air device; and enter the received comfort index into the a comfort index log if the received comfort index differs from the previous comfort index by a predetermined amount.
11. The microzone HVAC system in accordance with claim 10, wherein the memory of the precision air aggregator further stores instructions, which, when executed by the processor, cause the precision air aggregator to determine a collective HVAC demand specified by all microzones within the macrozone.
12. The microzone HVAC system in accordance with claim 10, wherein the memory of the precision air aggregator further stores instructions, which, when executed by the processor, cause the precision air aggregator to determine a collective HVAC demand specified by all microzones within the macrozone.
13. The microzone HVAC system in accordance with claim 10, wherein the memory of the precision air aggregator further stores instructions, which, when executed by the processor, cause the precision air aggregator to: receive a signal from a precision air device indicating the presence or absence of an occupant in the microzone associated with the precision air device; and respond to a signal indicating the absence of an occupant by causing the controller to turn off the air mover of the precision air device.
14. The microzone HVAC system in accordance with claim 10, wherein the memory of the precision air aggregator further stores a binding between a user and a precision air device.
15. The microzone HVAC system in accordance with claim 10, wherein the memory of the precision air aggregator further stores a binding between the precision air aggregator and a variable air volume (VAV) box of the macrozone.
