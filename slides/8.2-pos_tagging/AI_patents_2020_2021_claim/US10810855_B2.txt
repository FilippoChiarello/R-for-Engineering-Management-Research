<title>
System and method for monitoring activities of daily living of a person
</title>

<abstract>
Presented is a system and method for monitoring activities of daily living, ADLs, of a person within an environment containing an object that is controllable by the person via a control system. The system comprises a data collection unit adapted to obtain control data from the control system, the control data being based on one or more control signals generated by the control system for controlling the object. A data analysis unit is 5 adapted to determine an ADL event of the person based on the obtained control data.

<claims>
1. A system for monitoring activities of daily living, ADLs, of a person within an environment, the environment containing an object, the object comprising a light or home appliance adapted to be used for an execution of the ADL, the object being controllable by the person via a control system, the system comprising: a data collection unit adapted to obtain control system usage data directly from control data from the control system, the control data being based on one or more control signals generated by the control system to control the object; and a data analysis unit adapted to determine an ADL event of the person based on the obtained control system usage data, wherein the control system is a lighting or smart home control system and the control system usage data comprises lighting usage data obtained from lighting commands generated and issued by the control system.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising: a monitor unit adapted to determine a trend in a capability or activity of the person based on the determined ADL event and historical data relating to previously determined ADL events of the person.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the monitor unit is further adapted to detect an irregularity in the determined trend, and wherein the monitor unit is further arranged to generate an alert signal in response to the detected irregularity.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the monitor unit is adapted to detect an irregularity based on a comparison of the determined trend with a threshold value.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the threshold value is determined based on at least one of: one or more previously determined ADL events of the person; and one or more previously determined changes in ADL events of the person.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the data analysis unit is further adapted to store the determined ADL of the person in an activity database, and wherein the data analysis unit is further adapted to detect an irregularity in the activity database and to generate a warning signal in response to the detected irregularity.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the data analysis unit is further adapted to determine a frequency of an ADL in the activity database, the detected irregularity being dependent on a change in the frequency.
8. The system of claim 1, further comprising: a sensor adapted to detect a value of a property of at least one of: the environment and the object; and to generate a sensor output signal representative of the detected value, and wherein the data analysis unit is adapted to determine the ADL event of the person further based on the detected value.
9. The system of claim 1, further comprising: a control unit adapted to generate a control signal for controlling the object based on the determined ADL event.
10. The system of claim 1, further adapted to generate a display control signal for modifying a graphical element based on the determined ADL event of the person, and wherein the system further comprises: a display system adapted to display the graphical element in accordance with the generate display control signal.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the determined ADL of the person is taken from a group comprising: eating; cooking; medicating; sleeping; toileting; bathing; and washing.
12. A method for monitoring activities of daily living, ADLs, of a person within an environment, the environment containing an object, the object comprising a light or home appliance adapted to be used for an execution of the ADL, the object being controllable by the person via a control system, the method comprising: obtaining control system usage data directly from control data from the control system, the control data being based on one or more control signals generated by the control system to control the object; and determining an ADL event of the person based on the obtained control system usage data, wherein the control system is a lighting or smart home control system and the control system usage data comprises lighting usage data obtained from lighting commands generated and issued by the control system.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising: determining a trend in a capability or activity of the person based on the determined ADL event and historical data relating to previously determined ADL events of the person.
14. A non-transitory computer readable storage medium comprising a computer program product for monitoring activities of daily living, ADLs, of a person within an environment, the environment containing an object controllable by the person via a control system, wherein the computer program product comprises computer-readable program code configured to perform all of the steps of claim 12 when executed on one or more processors.
