METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PRODUCING MEDICAL IMAGES
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems for producing medical images are provided. A first medical image of a first modality is obtained. A second medical image of a second modality is generated, based on the first medical image and using an artificial intelligence, wherein the second medical image is mappable to a third modality of medical image. The second medical image is mapped to a third medical image of the third modality.

<claims>
1. A method for producing medical images, comprising:
obtaining a first medical image of a first modality;
generating a second medical image of a second modality based on the first medical image using an artificial intelligence, wherein the second medical image is mappable to a third modality of medical image; and
mapping the second medical image to a third medical image of the third modality.
2. The method of claim 1 , wherein generating the second medical image comprises segmenting the first medical image.
3. The method of claim 1 , further comprising augmenting a resolution of the first medical image using the artificial intelligence.
4. The method of claim 1 , wherein generating the second medical image comprises performing histogram normalization on the first medical image.
5. The method of claim 1 , wherein generating the third medical image comprises applying a ray-casting procedure to the second medical image.
6. The method of claim 1 , wherein the artificial intelligence is a cycle generative adversarial network.
7. The method of claim 1 , wherein the artificial intelligence is a conditional generative adversarial network.
8. The method of claim 1 , wherein the first modality corresponds to magneticresonance imaging images, the second modality corresponds to computed tomography images, and the third modality corresponds to C-arm images.
9. A method for training an artificial intelligence, comprising:
obtaining a plurality of unpaired images comprising first images of a first modality and second images of a second modality;
generating, for each of the first images, a corresponding first synthetic image of the second modality using a first artificial intelligence; generating, for each of the second images, a corresponding second synthetic image of the first modality using the first artificial intelligence; and
training a second artificial intelligence using a training image set comprising the first images, the first synthetic images, the second images, and the second synthetic images.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the first artificial intelligence is a cycle generative adversarial network (GAN), and wherein the second artificial intelligence is a conditional GAN.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the cycle GAN and/or the conditional GAN comprises two synthesis convolutional neural networks (CNN) and two discriminator CNN.
12. The method of claim 9, wherein the training image data set further comprises a paired image set comprising paired third images of the first and the second modalities resulting from medical imaging.
13. The method of claim 9, further comprising:
obtaining a subsequent image of the first modality; and
using the trained second artificial intelligence, generating a subsequent image of the second modality based on the subsequent image of the first modality.
14. The method of claim 13, further comprising segmenting the subsequent image.
15. The method of claim 13, further comprising augmenting a resolution of the subsequent image using a third artificial intelligence.
16. The method of claim 13, further comprising performing histogram normalization on the subsequent image.
17. The method of claim 9, wherein the first modality corresponds to magneticresonance imaging images, and the second modality corresponds to computed tomography images.
18. A system for producing medical images, comprising:
a processing unit; and
a non-transitory computer-readable medium having stored thereon program instructions executable by the processing unit for: obtaining a first medical image of a first modality;
generating a second medical image of a second modality based on the first medical image using an artificial intelligence, wherein the second medical images are mappable to a third modality of medical image; and
generating a third medical image of the third modality based on the second medical image.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein the artificial intelligence is a conditional generative adversarial network, wherein the first modality corresponds to magneticresonance imaging images, the second modality corresponds to computed tomography images, and the third modality corresponds to C-arm images, and wherein obtaining the first medical image comprises performing an MRI procedure of a lumbar region of a patient.
20. The system of claim 18, wherein the artificial intelligence comprises a cycle generative adversarial network.
