<title>
JOINT EMBEDDING OF CORPUS PAIRS FOR DOMAIN MAPPING
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for outside-in mapping for corpus pairs are provided. In one example, a computer-implemented method comprises: inputting first keywords associated with a first domain corpus; extracting a first keyword of the first keywords; inputting second keywords associated with a second domain corpus; generating an embedded representation of the first keyword via a trained model and generating an embedded representation of the second keywords via the trained model; and scoring a joint embedding affinity associated with a joint embedding. The scoring the joint embedding affinity comprises: transforming the embedded representation of the first keyword and the embedded representation of the second keywords via the trained model; determining an affinity value based on comparing the first keyword to the second keywords; and based on the affinity value, aggregating the joint embedding of the embedded representation of the first keyword and the embedded representation of the second keywords within the second domain corpus.
