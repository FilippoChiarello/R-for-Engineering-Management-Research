<title>
Performing convolution operations in graphics texture mapping units
</title>

<abstract>
A texture mapping apparatus, e.g. of a graphics processing unit, comprises texture fetching circuitry operable to receive a set of weight values for a convolution operation and fetch from memory a set of input data values on which the convolution operation is to be performed. The texture mapping apparatus further comprises texture filtering circuitry operable to perform a convolution operation using the set of received weight values and the set of fetched input data values. The texture mapping apparatus can allow a graphics processing unit to perform a variety of convolution operations in an efficient manner.
