<title>
AUTOMATIC SPORE TRAP
</title>

<abstract>
The present relates to a spore trap device comprising a reservoir adapted to receive contaminated leaves (1), and an electronic detection device (2), wherein the electronic detection device contains an aspiration tube, an optical chamber, a high purity filter and an air pump and characterized in that the aspiration tube is adapted to suck air in the vicinity of the contaminated leaves and send it to the optical chamber where the optical chamber comprises one or more optical sources and one or multiple optical detectors adapted to detect at least one of light scattering intensity, angular patterns, timely- resolved signal or any combination of these as well as at least one or fluorescence intensity, spectrum, decay or any combination of these caused by the spores. The spore trap device is to be placed nearby plants (3) that need to be protected against fungal related disease.

<claims>
1. Spore trap device comprising a reservoir adapted to receive contaminated leaves, and an electronic detection device, wherein the electronic detection device contains an aspiration tube, an optical chamber, a high purity filter and an air pump and characterized in that the aspiration tube is adapted to suck air in the vicinity of the contaminated leaves and send it to the optical chamber where the optical chamber comprises one or more optical sources and one or multiple optical detectors adapted to detect at least one of light scattering intensity, angular patterns, timely-resolved signal or any combination of these as well as at least one or fluorescence intensity, spectrum, decay or any combination of these caused by the spores.
2. Spore trap device according to claim 1 , characterized in that the device further comprises a warning system adapted to send a signal to a user that spores have been detected when spores are detected. 3. Spore trap device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the geometry of said a aspiration tube is such that it provides a way across which a significant quantity of spores can pass through it without stacking or bouncing back depending on the pathogen spore that is to be measured, the typical number of projected ascospores and signal-to-noise ratio of the detection chamber. 4. Spore trap device to claim 1 to 3, characterized in that the one or more optical sources comprise one or multiple lasers, flash lamps, LEDs and/or laser diode.
5. Spore trap device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the one or multiple optical detector comprises one or multiple optical detectors such as photomultipliers, photodiodes and/or avalanche photodiodes. 6. Spore trap device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the leaves are laid flat next to each other, covering a surface of 1 x 1 m or more.
7. Spore trap device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the leaves are placed between small section metal grids.
8. Spore trap device according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the multi-angle light scattering detector covers at least 4 scattering angles. 9. Spore trap device according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the multi-angle light scattering detector acquires traces of scattering in timely matter such that passage of each particle is recorded and resolved temporally.
10. Spore trap device according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the acquisition speed of the electronics should be at least 1 Mega sample per second and per channel.
1 1. Spore trap device according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the spectrally resolved light sensor covers at least 4 wavelength ranges (fluorescence bands).
12. Method of providing a user with an information that spores are emitting in a field of interest consisting in placing the device of any one of claims 1 to 11 in or near the field of interest such that it experiences the same meteorological conditions as the field, running in real time the detection of the spores, and upon detection of the spores of interest, sending a warning or information signal to a user indicating the same.
13. Use of the device of any one of claims 1 to 1 1 consisting in placing it in or near the field of interest such that it experiences the same meteorological conditions as the field, running in real time the detection of the spores, and upon detection of the spores of interest, sending a warning or information signal to a user indicating the same.
