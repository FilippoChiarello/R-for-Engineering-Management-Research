</title>

<abstract>
According to an aspect, there is provided a network node comprising means for performing the following. Initially, a trained machine learning algorithm for predicting a probability of failed delivery of data packets based on measurements is maintained in a database. The network node performs, for each of its wireless communication links, the following. The network node causes performing measurements relating to a first wireless communication link to form a measurement data set and predicts, using the trained machine learning algorithm and the measurement data set, a probability of failed delivery of a data packet over the first wireless communication link. The network node determines whether the probability of failed delivery of the data packet exceeds a threshold. If it does, the network node transmits to a first receiver the data packet over the first wireless communication link and one of a copy of the data packet and redundancy data.
