<title>
Diagnostic data acquisition system, diagnostic system, and computer readable medium
</title>

<abstract>
Upon performing diagnosis of a machine tool, etc., data suited to diagnosis is acquired while also reducing the burden on the user. A diagnostic data acquisition system that acquires diagnostic data for diagnosing a machine tool includes: a control unit that controls driving of a mobile part of the machine tool based on control data; a timing generation unit that generates an acquisition timing for the diagnostic data based on the control data; and a diagnostic data acquisition unit that acquires data which varies accompanying driving of the mobile part according to control by the control unit, as the diagnostic data.

<claims>
1. A diagnostic data acquisition system that acquires diagnostic data for diagnosing a machine tool, the system comprising: a control unit that controls, based on control data including a feedback signal acquired from the machine tool for controlling driving of a mobile part by way of feedback control, driving of the mobile part; a timing generation unit that generates an acquisition timing for the diagnostic data based on at least the feedback signal included in the control data; and a diagnostic data acquisition unit that acquires data, which varies accompanying driving of the mobile part by way of control of the control unit, based on the acquisition timing as the diagnostic data.
2. The diagnostic data acquisition system according to claim 1, wherein the diagnostic data acquisition unit acquires at least the predetermined feedback signal as the diagnostic data.
3. The diagnostic data acquisition system according to claim 1, further comprising: a measured data acquisition unit that acquires, from a measurement unit, measured data which was measured by the measurement unit that measures a state related to driving of the mobile part, wherein the diagnostic data acquisition unit acquires at least the measured data as the diagnostic data.
4. The diagnostic data acquisition system according to claim 3, wherein the timing generation unit generates the acquisition timing based also on the measured data acquired by the measured data acquisition unit, in addition to the control data.
5. The diagnostic data acquisition system according to claim 1, wherein the timing generation unit generates the acquisition timing, so that acquisition of the diagnostic data is started in a case of a driving speed of the mobile part becoming a constant speed, and acquisition of the diagnostic data is ended in a case of a load on the mobile part rising or declining more than a predetermined reference.
6. The diagnostic data acquisition system according to claim 5, wherein the timing generation unit calculates the speed of the mobile part and the load on the mobile part based on the control data.
7. A diagnostic system, comprising: the diagnostic data acquisition system according to claim 1; and a diagnostic device that diagnoses the machine tool based on the diagnostic data acquired by the diagnostic data acquisition system.
8. A diagnostic data acquisition program that causes a computer to function as a diagnostic data acquisition system, wherein the diagnostic data acquisition program causes the computer to function as the diagnostic data acquisition system according to claim 1.
