<abstract>
An integrated system for processing and using images acquired of subjects in a research or clinical environment is provided. The integrated system includes an image and data bank, a workflow management module, a cloud storage module and a pre-processing module. The pre-processing engine is positioned between the workflow management module and the cloud storage module and is configured to receive raw images, data associated with the raw images and the data associated with the imaged subjects from the workflow management module and process this data and provide the processed data to be pushed into the cloud storage module. The pre-processing engine also anonymizes the data to provide de- identified images and data to the cloud storage module and creates a key that relates the raw images, data associated with the raw images and the data associated with the imaged subjects to the de- identified, processed images and data. The key remains separate and un-connected from the de-identified, processed images and data. The key allows the de-identified, processed images and data to maintain traceability to the imaged subjects and to all subsequent operations on the images and data.
