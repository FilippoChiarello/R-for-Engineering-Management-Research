VOICE-BASED ORDER PROCESSING
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle is detected at a drive thru terminal and an automated voice-based dialogue is established with a user in the vehicle and the terminal. An order is placed for a transaction using natural-language speech. The automated voice-based dialogue identifies commands, nouns associated with menu items, adjectives associated with modifying the menu items, prepositions associated with modifying the menu items, and exclamations associated with confirming the order and associated menu items. The automated speech is identified and processed based on a specific lexicon associated with a specific type of restaurant. The speech is translated into actions processed through an ordering system/interface as text-based instructions. Feedback for the order and guidance during the order are provided to the user through: speech played over a speaker associated with the terminal, text displayed on a display, and/or images associated with the ordered items.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: initiating, at a drive thru terminal, a voice dialogue with a user for an order; translating speech provided by the user into text commands associated with an order interface using a lexicon associated with a type of restaurant; processing the text commands through the order interface; providing, at the drive thru terminal, speech feedback and guidance to the user during the order over a speaker; and completing, at the drive thru terminal, the order for subsequent order fulfillment processing.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein initiating further includes automatically detecting a vehicle with includes the user in front of the drive thru terminal.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein automatically detecting further includes processing images taken in a front of the drive thru terminal with a machine-learning algorithm to identify a presence of the vehicle.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein automatically detecting further includes identifying the vehicle through a motion or light sensor that detects the vehicle in front of the drive thru terminal.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein initiating further includes identifying a wake-up word or phrase received over a microphone of the drive thru terminal that is specific to ordering.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein translating further includes requesting clarification to a portion of the speech through a speech-clarification request played over the speaker to the user.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein translating further includes summarizing the speech once translated and playing a summary of the speech over the speaker to the user.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein processing further includes receiving order pricing and order details from the order interface as text information.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein providing further includes translating the text information into the speech feedback that is played over the speaker.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein translating further includes simultaneously presenting the text information on a display of the drive thru terminal as the speech feedback is played over the speaker to the user.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein simultaneously presenting further includes presenting images associated with the order items of the order details on the display with the text information.
12. The method of claim 11 further comprising, processing the speech and the speech feedback through a voice-enabled network device interfaced to the drive thru terminal using an enabled skill on the voice-enabled network device for the type of restaurant.
13. A method, comprising: automatically initiating a voice dialogue for a transaction associated with an order of a user in a vehicle at a drive thru terminal based on detection of an event; translating speech received over a microphone from a user into text commands, text order items, and text order customizations; formatting the text commands, text order items, and text order customizations into an order interface actions; providing the order interface actions to a transaction manager using an Application Programming Interface (API); receiving order pricing and order details over the API from the transaction manager; converting the order pricing and the order details into speech feedback; playing the speech feedback over a speaker to the user; iterating back to the translating until speech confirmation is received from the user indicating the voice dialogue has concluded; and providing instructions to the user for making payment to conclude the transaction.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein automatically initiating further includes detecting the event as an indication of a vehicle that includes the user being in front of the drive thru terminal using a camera or a motion/light sensor.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein automatically initiating further includes detecting the event as a predefined wake-up word that initiates the order when detected over the microphone.
16. The method of claim 13, wherein providing the order interface actions further includes obtaining a transaction number for the transaction and the order from the transaction manager.
17. The method of claim 13, wherein playing further includes displaying the order pricing and the order details on a display of the drive thru terminal.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein providing instructions further includes receiving a credit card or currency by the drive thru terminal from the user to complete the transaction.
19. A system, comprising: a display; a microphone; a speaker; a processor; a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having executable instructions representing a voice-based ordering service; and the voice-based ordering service when executed by the processor for the non-transitory computer-readable storage medium cause the processor to: engage a user while in a vehicle at a drive thru terminal in an interactive voice dialogue for taking an order at a restaurant; translate speech received during the interactive voice dialogue into text actions; process the text actions with an order interface; receive order pricing and order details from the order interface responsive to processing the text actions; communicate through speech feedback the order pricing and order details over the speaker; display the order pricing and the order details on the display; confirm through speech interaction that the order is complete; and request a payment method from the user to complete the order for order fulfillment processing.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein the voice-based ordering service when executed by the processor further cause the processor to: display unique images representing order items on the display during the interactive voice dialogue.
