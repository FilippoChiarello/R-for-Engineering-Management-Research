MULTIFUNCTIONAL CONTROL SYSTEM FOR USE IN A TIPPER VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
A multifunctional control system in combination with a vehicle (1 ) having a frame (2), a subframe (3), a tipper body (4) with a plurality of walls (6, 7), which is connected to the subframe (3) via a plurality of spherical supports (5), adapted to be selectively locked by means of pins (14), a lift cylinder (17) for lifting the body (4), a brake (10), a power takeoff (11) and an underrun protection bar (18). The control system comprises a plurality of sensors (23- 29) respectively for detecting the position of the walls (6, 7), the pins (14) and the cylinder (17), the operation of the brake (10), the engagement of the power takeoff (11) and the position of the bar (18), a central control unit (22) with sensors (23-29) connected thereto, and a terminal (30) connected to the unit (22) and designed to be actuated by an operator. The terminal (30) is an electronic device of tablet type having a touch-operated graphical interface (31 ) which is configured to select the tasks of opening the walls (6, 7), tipping the body (4) and positioning the bar (18) only if the power takeoff (11) is engaged, and comprises a speed limiter (32) and/or an acoustic or visual alert device (33) which is configured to be automatically operated to reduce the rotation speed of the engine and/or warn the operator about faults and hazard conditions if the body (4) remains in the lifted state and at least one wall (6, 7) remains in the open position.

A multifunctional control system in combination thereof with a transport vehicle (1 ) of the type comprising a frame (2), a subframe (3), a tipper body (4) having a plurality of walls (6, 7) and connected to the subframe (3) via a plurality of spherical supports (5) that are designed to be selectively locked by pins (14), a lift cylinder (17) for lifting the body (4), an emergency brake (10), a power takeoff (1 1 ) and an underrun protection bar (18), said control system comprising a plurality of first, second, third and fourth sensors (23-29), for detecting the position of the walls (6, 7), the position of the pins (14), the position of the cylinder (17), the actuation of the brake (10), the engagement of the power takeoff (1 1 ) and the position of the bar (18) respectively, a central control unit (22) with said sensors (23-29) operably connected thereto, a control terminal (30) connected to said control unit (22) and designed to be actuated by an operator, characterized in that said control terminal (30) is an electronic device of the tablet type with a touch-operated graphical interface (31 ), configured to select the tasks of opening the walls (6, 7), tipping the body (4) and positioning the bar (18) only if the power takeoff (1 1 ) is engaged, and further characterized in that it comprises a speed limiter (32) and/or an acoustic or visual alert device (33) which are configured to be automatically operated to reduce the rotation speed of the engine and/or warn the operator about anomalies and hazard conditions if the body (4) remains in the lifted state and at least one wall (6, 7) remains in the open position.
2. System as claimed in claim 1 , characterized in that said acoustic or visual alert device (33) is adapted to warn the operator about a hazard condition and the need to check the position of the body (4) and the walls (6, 7) under the same operating conditions of said speed limiter (32).
3. System as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said tablet (30) is connected to said central control unit (22) via a cable (30') or wireless communication means.
4. System as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it comprises a plurality of first (8, 9) and second (15) actuators, respectively associated with said first sensors (23, 24) for driving the walls (6, 7) of the body (4) and with said second sensors (25) for actuating said pins (14).
5. System as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it comprises a third actuator (20) for driving the cylinder (17), said third sensors (26, 27, 28) and said fourth sensors (29) being designed to respectively detect the position of the cylinder (17), the engagement of the power takeoff (1 1 ) and the engagement of the emergency brake (10).
6. System as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it comprises fourth actuators (21 ) associated with said fourth sensors (29) for actuating said underrun protection bar (18), said fourth sensors (29) being configured to detecting the position of said bar (18) between a raised"driving" position and a lifted"field" position.
7. System as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that said control unit (22) is configured to control the actuation of said lift cylinder (17) only when the said fourth sensor (29) of the underrun protection bar (18) detects the field position and when the power takeoff (1 1 ) is engaged.
8. System as claimed in claim 1 , characterized in that an appropriate software is installed on said control unit (22) to control by means of said tablet (30) additional functions of apparatus and accessories of the vehicle, such as a sunroof of the tipper body (4), a control camera, a swiveling headlight, cereal outlets, an electric warning triangle and a balancer.
9. A method of multifunctional control of a transport vehicle (1 ) having a tipper body (4) via a control system according to one or more of the preceding claims, comprising the operating steps of:
a) selecting a tipping side (A, B, C) and locking the selected pins (14); b) selecting one or more walls (6, 7) along the tipping side (A, B, C); c) opening the selected walls (6, 7);
d) selecting the"field" position of the bar (18) and then actuating the bar (18) to move it to the selected position;
e) actuating the lift cylinder (17) to cause tipping;
wherein said step of a) selecting the pins (14) is only allowed when the emergency brake is engaged (10);
wherein said steps of c) opening the walls (6, 7) and d) actuating the bar (18) and e) actuating the cylinder (17) are only allowed when the power takeoff (1 1 ) is engaged;
wherein the speed limiter (32) and/or the acoustic or visual alert device (33) are automatically switched on when at least one of the walls (6, 7) are open and is automatically switched off when all the walls (6, 7) are closed; and wherein the speed limiter (32) and/or the acoustic or visual alert device (33) are always disabled when the bar (18) is in the"field" position.
