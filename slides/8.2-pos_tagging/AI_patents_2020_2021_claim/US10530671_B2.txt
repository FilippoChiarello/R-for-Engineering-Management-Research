Methods, systems, and computer readable media for generating and using a web page classification model
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and computer readable media for generating and using a web page classification model are disclosed. The method may include identifying a plurality of web pages for generating a web page classification model, assigning a label to each of the plurality of web pages, accessing Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) traffic traces associated with downloading content from each of the plurality of web pages, processing TCP/IP headers from the TCP/IP traffic traces to identify and extract features that discriminate between the labels, that are uncorrelated and whose discriminatory accuracy remains stable across time and/or browser platform. The method may further include generating a web page classification model by training a trainer to learn a combination of the features that accurately discriminates between the labels. The model is usable to classify unlabeled web pages by applying the model to TCP/IP traffic traces used to access the unlabeled web pages.

<claims>
1. A method of generating and using a web page classification model, the method comprising: identifying a plurality of web pages for use in generating the web page classification model; assigning a label to each of the plurality of web pages; accessing, by a processor, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) traffic traces associated with downloading content from each of the plurality of web pages; processing, by the processor, TCP/IP headers from the TCP/IP traffic traces to identify and extract features that discriminate between the labels, that are uncorrelated and whose discriminatory accuracy remains stable across time and/or browser platform; generating, by the processor, the web page classification model by training a model trainer to learn a combination of the features that accurately discriminates between the labels, that includes uncorrelated features, and that remains stable across time and/or browser platform; and using the web page classification model to classify unlabeled web pages by applying the web page classification model to TCP/IP traffic traces used to access the unlabeled web pages.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising verifying the accuracy of the web page classification model using observed web page classification data.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein assigning a label to each of the plurality of web pages comprises assigning an Alexa Genre Label (AGL), a Video Streaming Label (VSL), a Targeted Device Label (TDL), or a Web Page Navigation Label (WNL).
4. The method of claim 3, wherein assigning the label includes assigning the AGL and wherein the AGL is a content based label indicative of a content genre class of a web page, the content genre class being selected from generic subjects including computers, shopping, business, or news.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein assigning the label includes assigning the VSL, and wherein the VSL includes at least two classes indicative of the content of a web page, where a first class is video page and a second class is a non-video page.
6. The method of claim 3, wherein assigning the label includes assigning the TDL and wherein the TDL includes at least two classes indicative of a device used to download a web page, where a first class is a traditional web page and a second class is a mobile optimized web page.
7. The method of claim 3, wherein assigning the label includes assigning the WNL and wherein the WNL includes at least three classes indicative of a navigation flow used to download a web page, where a first class is a clickable content page, a second class is a search result page, and/or a third class is a landing page.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the accessed TCP/IP traces are downloaded using a plurality of different browsers, a plurality of different types of devices, or a plurality of operating systems.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein processing the TCP/IP headers includes processing anonymized TCP/IP headers.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the features include temporal features, multi-flow features, or statistical derivatives thereof.
11. A system for generating a web page classification model, the system comprising: a processor for accessing Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) traffic traces associated with downloading content from a plurality of web pages and processing TCP/IP headers from the TCP/IP traffic traces; a web page classification model generator executed by the processor for generating the web page classification model, wherein the model generator includes: a labeler for assigning a label to each of the plurality of web pages; a feature extractor for identifying and extracting features from the processed TCP/IP headers that discriminate between the labels, that are uncorrelated and whose discriminatory accuracy remains stable across time and/or browser platform; and a model trainer for generating the web page classification model by learning a combination of the features that accurately discriminates between the labels, that includes uncorrelated features, and that remains stable across time and/or browser platform; wherein the web page classification model is usable to classify unlabeled web pages by applying the web page classification model to TCP/IP traffic traces used to access the unlabeled web pages.
12. The system of claim 11, further comprising a model testing and validation module (MTVM) for verifying the accuracy of the web page classification model using observed web page classification data.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the label includes at least one of an Alexa Genre Label (AGL), a Video Streaming Label (VSL), a Targeted Device Label (TDL), or a Web Page Navigation Label (WNL).
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the label includes the AGL and the AGL is a content based label indicative of a content genre class of a web page, the content genre class being selected from generic subjects including computers, shopping, business, or news.
15. The system of claim 13, wherein the label includes the VSL and wherein the VSL includes at least two classes indicative of the content of a web page, where a first class is video page and a second class is a non-video page.
16. The system of claim 13, wherein the label includes the TDL and wherein the TDL includes at least two classes indicative of a device used to download a web page, where a first class is a traditional web page and a second class is a mobile optimized web page.
17. The system of claim 13, wherein the label includes the WNL and wherein the WNL includes at least three classes indicative of a navigation flow used to download a web page, where a first class is a clickable content page, a second class is a search result page, and a third class is a landing page.
18. The system of claim 11, wherein the TCP/IP traces are downloaded using a plurality of different browsers, a plurality of different types of devices, or a plurality of operating systems.
19. The system of claim 11, wherein the TCP/IP headers are anonymized.
20. The system of claim 11, wherein the discriminatory features include temporal features, multi-flow features, or statistical derivatives thereof.
21. A non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon executable instructions that when executed by a processor of a computer control the computer to perform steps comprising: identifying a plurality of web pages for use in generating a web page classification model; assigning a label to each of the plurality of web pages; accessing Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) traffic traces associated with downloading content from each of the plurality of web pages; processing TCP/IP headers from the TCP/IP traffic traces to identify and extract features that discriminate between the labels, that are uncorrelated and whose discriminatory accuracy remains stable across time and/or browser platform; generating the web page classification model by training a classifier to learn a combination of the features that accurately discriminates between the labels, that includes uncorrelated features, and that remains stable across time and/or browser platform; and using the web page classification model to classify unlabeled web pages by applying the web page classification model to TCP/IP traffic traces used to access the unlabeled web pages.
