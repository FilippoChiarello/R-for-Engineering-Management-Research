SYSTEM AND METHOD USING CLINICAL DATA TO PREDICT GENETIC RELATEDNESS FOR THE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT AND REDUCTION OF HEALTHCARE-ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A method for identifying two or more infections as related or non-related infections based on an estimated genetic relatedness of the two or more infections, comprising: (i) receiving, for each of two or more infected patients, infection-relevant information comprising an antibiotic resistance profile for the patient's infection, a geo-temporal record for the patient, and a caregiver history for the patient; (ii) estimating, using a trained genetic relatedness model, a genetic relatedness of at least two of the two or more infections; (iii) comparing the estimated genetic relatedness between at least two of the two or more infections to a predetermined threshold; (iv) identifying, based on the comparison, the at least two of the two or more infections as a related infection or a non-related infection.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method for identifying two or more infections as related or non-related infections based on an estimated genetic relatedness of the two or more infections, comprising:
receiving, for each of two or more infected patients, infection-relevant information comprising an antibiotic resistance profile for the patient's infection, a geo-temporal record for the patient, and a caregiver history for the patient;
estimating, using a trained genetic relatedness model analyzing the received infection-relevant information for the two or more infected patients, a genetic relatedness of at least two of the two or more infections;
comparing the estimated genetic relatedness between at least two of the two or more infections to a predetermined threshold; and
identifying, based on the comparison, the at least two of the two or more infections as a related infection or a non-related infection, wherein the at least two of the two or more infections are identified as a related infection if the estimated genetic relatedness falls below the predetermined threshold, and wherein the at least two of the two or more infections are identified as a non-related infection if the estimated genetic relatedness exceeds the predetermined threshold.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the trained genetic relatedness model estimates genetic relatedness of the at least two of the two or more infections without sequencing data.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the genetic relatedness of the two or more infections comprises a predicted number of SNPs between at least two of the two or more infections.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
obtaining, if the at least two of the two or more infections are identified as related, sequencing data for each of the at least two of the two or more infections; and determining, using the obtained sequencing data, the relatedness of the at least two of the two or more infections.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
displaying, on an interactive user interface, a representation of the estimated genetic relatedness between the at least two of the two or more infections.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the representation of the estimated genetic relatedness comprises a network graph of two or more patients and/or infections.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
adjusting, using an interactive user interface, the predetermined threshold.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the predetermined threshold is based at least in part on the identity of a pathogen causing the two or more infections.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of training the trained genetic relatedness model, comprising:
receiving, from a database of infection data, infection-relevant information for a plurality of patients and pathogen sequencing data for an infection associated with each of the plurality of patients;
calculating, using the sequencing data, genetic relatedness between the infections of two or more of the plurality of patients;
generating, from the received infection-relevant information and the calculated genetic relatedness between the infections, a predictive model designed to provide an estimate of genetic relatedness between two or more infections using only infection-relevant information.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the genetic relatedness model comprises a decision tree.
11. A system configured to identify two or more infections as related or non-related infections based on an estimated genetic relatedness of the two or more infections, comprising:
infection-relevant information for each of two or more infected patients, comprising an antibiotic resistance profile for the patient's infection, a geo-temporal record for the patient, and a caregiver history for the patient;
a trained genetic relatedness model configured to analyze the received infection relevant information for the two or more infected patients and to estimate based on that analysis a genetic relatedness of at least two of the two or more infections;
a processor configured to: (i) compare the estimated genetic relatedness between at least two of the two or more infections to a predetermined threshold; and (i) identify, based on the comparison, the at least two of the two or more infections as a related infection or a nonrelated infection, wherein the at least two of the two or more infections are identified as a related infection if the estimated genetic relatedness falls below the predetermined threshold, and wherein the at least two of the two or more infections are identified as a non-related infection if the estimated genetic relatedness exceeds the predetermined threshold; and
a user interface configured to display a representation of the estimated genetic relatedness between the at least two of the two or more infections.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the representation of the estimated genetic relatedness comprises a network graph of two or more patients and/or infections.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the trained genetic relatedness model estimates genetic relatedness of the at least two of the two or more infections without sequencing data.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the predetermined threshold is based at least in part on the identity of a pathogen causing the two or more infections.
15. The system of claim 11, wherein the genetic relatedness of the two or more infections comprises a predicted number of SNPs between at least two of the two or more infections.
