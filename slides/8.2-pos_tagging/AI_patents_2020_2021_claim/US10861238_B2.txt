<title>
Experiential representation of data in mixed reality
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosed technology is generally directed to mixed reality visualization. In one example of the technology, a mixed-reality view is provided. The mixed-reality view includes at least a real-world component and at least a virtual component. The virtual component includes a view associated with an application. Data in the application that is associated with a quantified property is identified. For the identified data, a data type and a quantity are determined. An experiential visualization library is used to create an experiential visualization of the data based on the determined data type and the determined quantity. The created experiential visualization is displayed as part of the virtual component of the mixed reality view.

<claims>
We claim:
1. An apparatus, comprising: a device including at least one memory adapted to store run-time data for the device, and at least one processor that is adapted to execute processor-executable code that, in response to execution, enables the device to perform actions, including: providing a mixed-reality view, wherein the mixed-reality view includes at least a real-world component and at least a virtual component, and wherein the virtual component includes a view associated with an application; identifying data in text displayed by the application that is associated with a quantified property; determining, for the identified data in the text displayed by the application, a data type and a quantity; using an experiential visualization library to create an experiential visualization of the data based on the determined data type and the determined quantity; and displaying the created experiential visualization as part of the virtual component of the mixed reality view such that the created experiential visualization visually represents the determined quantity by at least one of: a dynamic representation of the determined quantity or a comparison of the determined quantity with a different quantity.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein machine learning is used to determine the data type and quantity for the identified data.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the created experiential visualization includes at least one moving three-dimensional hologram that is associated with the determined data type and the determined quantity.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein identifying the data includes: allowing the user to select data; and determining whether the selected data is associated with a quantified property for which a corresponding data type exists in the experiential visualization library.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein at least one aspect of the created experiential visualization varies in a realistic manner in accordance with the determined quantity.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the device is mixed-reality device including at least one holographic processing unit and a head-mounted display unit connected to a headband.
7. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising enabling the user to adjust the experiential visualization.
8. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein enabling the user to adjust the experiential visualization includes allowing the user to filter data shown in the experiential visualization.
9. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the quantified property is associated with motion.
10. The apparatus of claim 9, wherein the quantified property is velocity.
11. A method, comprising: displaying a mixed-reality view, wherein the mixed-reality view includes at least a virtual aspect and at least a real-world component, and wherein the virtual aspect includes at least a portion of an application view associated with an application; enabling a user to select data in text displayed by the application that is associated with a quantified property; using at least one processor to identify, for the selected data in the text displayed by the application, a data type and a quantity; using an experiential representation repository to provide an experiential representation of the data based on the identified data type and the identified quantity; and displaying the provided experiential representation as part of the virtual aspect of the mixed reality view such that the created experiential visualization visually represents the determined quantity by at least one of: a dynamic representation of the determined quantity or a comparison of the determined quantity with a different quantity.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein machine learning is used to identify the data type and quantity for the selected data.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the created experiential representation includes at least one moving three-dimensional hologram that is associated with the identified data type and the identified quantity.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein the quantified property is associated with motion.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the quantified property is velocity.
16. A processor-readable storage medium, having stored thereon processor-executable code that, upon execution by at least one processor, enables actions, comprising: identifying, in text displayed by an application, data that is associated with a quantified property; determining, for the identified data in the text displayed by the application, a data type and a quantity; using an experiential representation library to create an experiential representation of the data based on the determined data type and the determined quantity; and providing the created experiential representation such that the created experiential visualization visually represents the determined quantity by at least one of: a dynamic representation of the determined quantity or a comparison of the determined quantity with a different quantity.
17. The processor-readable storage medium of claim 16, wherein machine learning is used to determine the data type and quantity for the identified data.
18. The processor-readable storage medium of claim 16, wherein the created experiential representation includes at least one moving three-dimensional hologram that is associated with the determined data type and the determined quantity.
19. The processor-readable storage medium of claim 16, wherein the quantified property is associated with motion.
20. The processor-readable storage medium of claim 19, wherein the quantified property is velocity.
