SYSTEM AND METHOD OF ASYNCHRONOUS ROBOTIC RETRIEVAL AND DELIVERY OF ITEMS
</title>

<abstract>
Asynchronous item delivery utilizes a depot and a mobile robot. A method includes (1) receiving a specification by a user of a destination depot and an item, (2) selecting, based on item delivery data and by a depot control system, a drawer from a rack module in a depot that houses drawers, (3) receiving the item from the user via the depot user interface, (4) communicating the item to the drawer within the rack module that houses drawers, communicating, from the depot and to a mobile robot, a message to pick up the item, (5) swapping a first battery on the mobile robot with a second batter charged by the depot, (6) transferring the item from the drawer in the depot to the mobile robot using a depot drawer-swapping module and a mobile robot drawer-swapping module and (7) delivering, by the mobile robot, the item to the destination depot.

<claims>
1. A mobile robot comprising: a mobile robot drawer-swapping module; and a mobile control system that connects and controls the mobile robot drawer-swapping module, wherein the mobile robot operates in a coordinated manner with a depot to asynchronously deliver an item from the depot to a destination depot by the mobile robot performing operations comprising: receiving, from the depot, a message to pick up an item, the item deposited in a drawer of the depot, wherein the depot received a specification by a user of the destination depot and the item; receiving, based on the message, a transfer of the item from the drawer of the depot to the mobile robot via a depot drawer-swapping module and the mobile robot drawer-swapping module; and delivering the item to the destination depot.
2. The mobile robot of claim 1, wherein the depot scans the item before receiving the item in the drawer.
3. The mobile robot of claim 1, further comprising receiving a manifest for each drawer in a rack module of the depot that houses the drawers.
4. The mobile robot of claim 3, wherein the manifest comprises one or more of an identification of the drawer, items in the drawer, the destination depot, and instructions for delivery of the item.
5. The mobile robot of claim 3, wherein the depot, after receiving the item in the drawer, routes the drawer to a chosen position in the rack module in preparation for retrieval by the mobile robot.
6. The mobile robot of claim 1, wherein delivering, by the mobile robot, the item to the destination depot is performed using machine learning to schedule one of a route, a timing and a pace of delivering the item to the destination depot.
7. The mobile robot of claim 1, further comprising a mobile robot battery swapping module, which when instructed by the mobile control system, is configured to swap a first battery on the mobile robot with a second charged battery from the depot when the first battery has a charge level that is less than a threshold.
8. A method comprising: receiving, at a mobile robot and from a depot having a rack module that houses drawers, a message to pick up an item within a drawer of the drawers, wherein the depot received the item from a user and wherein the user specified a destination depot of the item; receiving a transfer of the item from the drawer of the depot using a depot drawer-swapping module and a mobile robot drawer-swapping module; and delivering the item to the destination depot.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the depot scans the item before receiving the item in the drawer.
10. The method of claim 8, further comprising receiving a manifest for each drawer in the rack module that houses the drawers, the manifest comprising one or more of an identification of the drawer, items in the drawer, the destination depot, and instructions for delivery of the item.
11. The method of claim 8, further comprising: determining that a charge level of a first battery installed in the mobile robot is less than a threshold; and swapping the first battery with a second charged battery in the depot.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the depot, after receiving the item in the drawer, routes the drawer to a chosen position in the rack module in preparation for retrieval by the mobile robot.
13. The method of claim 8, wherein delivering, by the mobile robot, the item to the destination depot is performed using machine learning to schedule one of a route, a timing and a pace of delivering the item to the destination depot.
14. A mobile robot comprising: a processor; and a computer-readable storage device storing instructions which, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform operations comprising: receiving a message to pick up an item stored at a depot having a rack module that houses drawers with respective items, in which a user provided the item to the depot with a specification of a destination depot for the item; and receiving the item, from a drawer of the drawers, at the mobile robot using a depot drawer-swapping module and a mobile robot drawer-swapping module, wherein the mobile robot is configured to deliver the item to the destination depot.
15. The mobile robot of claim 14, wherein the depot scans the item before receiving the item in the drawer.
16. The mobile robot of claim 14, wherein the computer-readable storage device stores additional instructions which, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform operations comprising: receiving at the mobile robot a manifest for each drawer in the rack module that houses the drawers.
17. The mobile robot of claim 16, wherein the manifest comprises one or more of an identification of the drawer, items in the drawer, the destination depot, and instructions for delivery of the item.
18. The mobile robot of claim 14, wherein the computer-readable storage device stores additional instructions which, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform operations comprising: after receiving the item in the drawer, routing the drawer to a chosen position in the rack module in preparation for retrieval by the mobile robot.
19. The mobile robot of claim 14, wherein delivering, by the mobile robot, the item to the destination depot is performed using machine learning to schedule one of a route, a timing and a pace of delivering the item to the destination depot.
20. The mobile robot of claim 14, wherein the operations further comprise: receiving a message from the mobile robot indicating that a request for battery swap; and instructing a first battery-swapping module of the depot to interact with a second battery-swapping module of the mobile robot to swap a first charged battery available at the depot with a second battery inside the mobile robot having less than a threshold charge remaining.
