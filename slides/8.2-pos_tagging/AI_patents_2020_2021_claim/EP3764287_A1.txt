TRANSACTION POLICY AUDIT
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure involves systems, software, and computer implemented methods for transaction auditing. One example method includes receiving receipt data associated with an entity. Policy questions associated with the entity are associated with at least one policy question answer that corresponds to a conformance or a violation of a policy selected by the entity. For each policy question, a machine learning policy model is identified for the policy question that includes, for each policy question answer, receipt data features that correspond to the policy question answer. The machine learning policy model is used to automatically determine a selected policy question answer to the policy question by comparing features of extracted tokens to respective receipt data features of the policy question answers that are included in the machine learning policy model. In response to determining that the selected policy question answer corresponds to a policy violation, an audit alert is generated.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: receiving receipt data associated with a request associated with a first entity, wherein the receipt data includes tokens extracted from at least one receipt; identifying policy questions associated with the first entity, wherein each policy question is associated with at least one policy question answer, and wherein each policy question answer corresponds to a conformance or a violation of a policy selected by the first entity; and for each respective policy question in the identified policy questions: identifying a machine learning policy model for the respective policy question based on a mapping associated with the first entity that maps policy questions to machine learning policy models, wherein the machine learning policy model is trained based on historical determinations of policy question answers for the respective policy question for historical receipt data, and wherein the machine learning policy model includes, for each policy question answer, receipt data features that correspond to the policy question answer; using the machine learning policy model to automatically determine a selected policy question answer to the respective policy question by comparing features of the extracted tokens to respective receipt data features of the policy question answers that are included in the machine learning policy model; and in response to determining that the selected policy question answer corresponds to a policy violation, generating an audit alert.
2. The method of Claim 1, wherein the historical determination of policy question answers to the respective policy question are determined, based on the historical receipt data, by previous executions of the machine learning policy model.
3. The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the historical receipt data includes information from multiple entities, wherein the multiple entities include a second entity that is different from the first entity.
4. The method of any one of the preceding claims, further comprising: failing to identify, for a first policy question, a machine learning policy model for the first policy question; and forwarding the receipt data to a secondary review process in response to failing to identifying a machine learning policy model for the first policy question.
5. The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the policy questions associated with the first entity include standard policy questions common to multiple entities.
6. The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the policy questions associated with the first entity include custom questions specific to the first entity.
7. The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein different policy questions that have a same semantic meaning are mapped to a same machine learning policy model.
8. The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein identifying the machine learning policy model comprises identifying a keyword-based model.
9. The method of Claim 8, wherein the keyword-based model is configured to identify one or more keywords in the extracted tokens.
10. The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein identifying the machine learning policy model comprises identifying a neural network model.
11. The method of Claim 10, wherein the neural network model is a recurrent neural network model.
12. The method of Claim 10, wherein the neural network model is configured to perform character analysis of the receipt data to identify features that indicate a policy violation or a policy conformance.
13. The method of Claim 12, wherein the features include keyword patterns, receipt text format, and receipt layout.
14. A system comprising: one or more computers; and a computer-readable medium coupled to the one or more computers having instructions stored thereon which, when executed by the one or more computers, cause the one or more computers to perform the method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims.
15. A computer program product encoded on a non-transitory storage medium, the product comprising non-transitoiy, computer readable instructions for causing one or more processors to perform the method as claimed in any one of claims 1-13.
