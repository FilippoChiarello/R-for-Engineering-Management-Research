<title>
DEEP HIERARCHICAL FUSION FOR MACHINE INTELLIGENCE APPLICATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A method for processing multi-modal input includes receiving multiple signal inputs, each signal input having a corresponding input mode. Each signal input is processed in a series of mode-specific processing stages. Each successive mode-specific stage is associated with a successively longer scale of analysis of the signal input. A fused output is generated based on the output of a series of fused processing stages. Each successive fused processing stage is associated with a successively longer scale of analysis of the signal input. Multiple fused processing stages receive inputs from corresponding mode-specific processing stages, so that the fused output depends on the multiple of signal inputs.

<claims>
1. A method for processing multi-modal input comprising: receiving a plurality of signal inputs, each signal input having a corresponding input mode; processing each signal input in a series of mode-specific processing stages, each successive mode-specific stage being associated with a successively longer scale of analysis of the signal input; and generating a fused output based on the output of a series of fused processing stages, each successive fused processing stage being associated with a successively longer scale of analysis of the signal input; wherein multiple fused processing stages receive inputs from corresponding mode-specific processing stages, whereby the fused output depends on the plurality of signal inputs.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the plurality of signal inputs represent a linguistically-based output from a subject, and wherein the method further providing the fused output comprising a representation of a sentiment expressed in the linguistically-based output.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the input modes corresponding to the signal inputs comprise an audio input mode.
4. The method of claim 3 wherein the input modes corresponding to the signal inputs further comprise a text input mode.
5. The method of claim 4 wherein the text mode input comprises an automated speech recognition of the audio mode input.
6. The method of claim 3 wherein the input modes corresponding to the signal inputs further comprise a video input mode, wherein the video mode input comprises a facial image of a speaker producing speech representing the audio mode input.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein the input modes corresponding to the signal inputs comprises a first timescale audio input mode and a second timescale audio input mode, wherein the second timescale is longer than the first timescale.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein the successively longer scales of analysis comprise a word scale analysis and a sentence or utterance scale analysis.
9. The method of claim 1 wherein at least some of the processing stages include feed-forward neural network encoders.
10. The method of claim 1 wherein at least some of the processing stages include long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.
11. The method of claim 10 wherein the inputs from the corresponding mode-specific processing stages comprise LSTM state values.
12. A non-transitory machine-readable medium having instructions stored hereon, wherein the instructions when executed by a computer processor cause processing or a multi-modal input, the processing comprising: receiving a plurality of signal inputs, each signal input having a corresponding input mode; processing each signal input in a series of mode-specific processing stages, each successive mode-specific stage being associated with a successively longer scale of analysis of the signal input; and generating a fused output based on the output of a series of fused processing stages, each successive fused processing stage being associated with a successively longer scale of analysis of the signal input; wherein multiple fused processing stages receive inputs from corresponding mode-specific processing stages, whereby the fused output depends on the plurality of signal inputs.
