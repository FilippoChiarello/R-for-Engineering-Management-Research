ADDING CUSTOM AND DYNAMIC MULTIMEDIA TO TARGET FILES
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and apparatus, including computer program products, implementing and using techniques for converting a target file into a multimedia presentation. A target file including text is received. A class of the target file is identified based on characteristics of the target file. A multimedia presentation is created that contains speech rendered from a portion of the text, additional text, wherein the portion of the text is selected in accordance with a template programmed with content and logic for the identified class, a visual representation of the document, and one or more manipulations of the visual representation defined in accordance with the content and logic of the template. In response to a user command to run the multimedia presentation, the speech, visual representation, and/or the manipulations are output in accordance with the logic of the template.

<claims>
1. A method for converting a target file into a multimedia presentation, comprising: receiving a target file that includes text; identifying a class of the target file in accordance with one or more characteristics of the target file; and creating a multimedia presentation including one or more of: speech rendered from a portion of the text and additional text, wherein the portion of the text is selected in accordance with a template programmed with content and logic for the identified class, a visual representation of the target file, and one or more manipulations of the visual representation of the target file defined in accordance with the content and logic of the template.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: in response to a user command to run the multimedia presentation, outputting one or more of: the speech, the visual representation of the target file, and the one or more manipulations in accordance with the logic of the template.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the template is represented as a tree of cards and nodes forming logical relationships, wherein: one or more cards which contain content to be displayed in the visual representation of the target file, and one or more nodes which determine a flow of the multimedia presentation through the logical tree.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the template contains instructions for extracting text from the target file based on the location of the text within the target file.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising processing the extracted text in accordance with a set of post processing rules.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the template is automatically created at least in part, based on rules and content of a target document.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the template is automatically created using machine learning and artificial intelligence, based at least in part on data collected during client interaction with the multimedia presentation.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more manipulations of the visual representation include a timing for how different portions of the visual representation will be displayed to a user.
9. A computer program product for converting a target file into a multimedia presentation, the computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, wherein the computer readable storage medium is not a transitory signal per se, the program instructions being executable by a processor to perform a method comprising: receiving a target file that includes text; identifying a class of the target file in accordance with one or more characteristics of the target file; and creating a multimedia presentation including one or more of: speech rendered from a portion of the text and additional text, wherein the portion of the text is selected in accordance with a template programmed with content and logic for the identified class, a visual representation of the target file, and one or more manipulations of the visual representation of the target file defined in accordance with the content and logic of the template.
10. The computer program product of claim 9, further comprising instructions to perform the step: in response to a user command to run the multimedia presentation, outputting one or more of: the speech, the visual representation of the target file, and the one or more manipulations in accordance with the logic of the template.
11. The computer program product of claim 9, wherein the template is represented as a tree of cards and nodes forming logical relationships, wherein: one or more cards which contain content to be displayed in the visual representation of the target file, and one or more nodes which determine a flow of the multimedia presentation through the logical tree.
12. The computer program product of claim 9, wherein the template contains instructions for extracting text from the target file based on the location of the text within the target file.
13. The computer program product of claim 10, further comprising instructions to process the extracted text in accordance with a set of post processing rules.
14. The computer program product of claim 9, wherein the template is automatically created at least in part, based on rules and content of the target document.
15. The computer program product of claim 9, wherein the one or more manipulations of the visual representation include a timing for how different portions of the visual representation will be displayed to a user.
16. The computer program product of claim 9, wherein the template is automatically created using machine learning and artificial intelligence, based at least in part on data collected during client interaction with the multimedia presentation.
17. A system converting a target file into a multimedia presentation, comprising: a processor; and a memory containing instructions that when executed by the processor causes the following steps to be performed: receiving a target file that includes text; identifying a class of the target file in accordance with one or more characteristics of the target file; and creating a multimedia presentation including one or more of: speech rendered from a portion of the text and additional text, wherein the portion of the text is selected in accordance with a template programmed with content and logic for the identified class, a visual representation of the target file, and one or more manipulations of the visual representation of the target file defined in accordance with the content and logic of the template.
