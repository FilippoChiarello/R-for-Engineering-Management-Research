<title>
Assessment and improvement of treatment using imaging of physiological responses to radiation therapy
</title>

<abstract>
Edema in tissue of a patient undergoing a course of radiation therapy or treatment can be estimated based on one or more MRI measurements used to measure changes in fluid content of various tissues. A correlation between observed changes in edema and one or more delivered fractions of radiation can be used to drive one or more clinical actions. Methods, systems, articles of manufacture, and the like are described.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: an MRI system; a radiation source; and at least one non-transitory machine-readable medium storing instructions which, when executed by a programmable processor, cause the programmable processor to perform operations comprising: capturing a baseline MRI scan and, during a treatment, a subsequent MRI scan; comparing a baseline edema analysis utilizing the baseline MRI scan with a subsequent edema analysis utilizing the subsequent MRI scan to estimate a change in edema in patient tissues; and alerting a clinician or stopping treatment when the estimated change in edema exceeds an expected value.
2. A system as in claim 1, wherein the baseline MRI scan and the subsequent MRI scan comprise at least one of: a T1-weighted MRI scan, a T2-weighted MRI scan, a ratio of T1-weighted MRI to T2-weighted MRI scan results, and an MRI response ratio.
3. A system as in claim 1, wherein the comparing comprises quantifying changes in free hydrogen content.
4. A system as in claim 1, the operations further comprising generating, at a display, a visual depiction of an estimate of an amount of cell death in the patient tissues.
5. A system as in claim 4, the visual depiction including the use of voxels on a 2D map.
6. A system as in claim 4, wherein the visual depiction comprises a differential change in a ratio of T1-weighted MRI to T2-weighted MRI scans and the differential change is presented as a function of location.
7. A computer program product comprising a non-transitory machine-readable medium storing instructions which, when executed by a programmable processor, cause the programmable processor to perform operations comprising: capturing a baseline MRI scan and, during a treatment, a subsequent MRI scan; comparing a baseline edema analysis utilizing the baseline MRI scan with a subsequent edema analysis utilizing the subsequent MRI scan to estimate a change in edema in patient tissues; and alerting a clinician or stopping treatment when the estimated change in edema exceeds an expected value.
8. A computer program product as in claim 7, wherein the baseline MRI scan and the subsequent MRI scan comprise at least one of: a T1-weighted MRI scan, a T2-weighted MRI scan, a ratio of T1-weighted MRI to T2-weighted MRI scan results, and an MRI response ratio.
9. A computer program product as in claim 7, wherein the comparing comprises quantifying changes in free hydrogen content.
10. A computer program product as in claim 7, the operations further comprising generating, at a display, a visual depiction of an estimate of an amount of cell death in the patient tissues.
11. A computer program product as in claim 10, the visual depiction including the use of voxels on a 2D map.
12. A computer program product as in claim 10, wherein the visual depiction comprises a differential change in a ratio of T1-weighted MRI to T2-weighted MRI scans and the differential change is presented as a function of location.
