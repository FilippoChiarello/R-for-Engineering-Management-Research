<title>
ON-PLATFORM ANALYTICS
</title>

<abstract>
Solutions for performing on-platform analytics for collected images include: enriching, on-board an orbital platform, collected images using a packaged analytics component; based at least on content of the collected images, selecting a set of the collected images to transmit to a ground station; and transmitting the selected set of the collected images to the ground station. Other solutions include: packaging an analytics component for on-platform execution by a platform in orbit; transmitting, from a ground station to the platform, at least one update selected from the list consisting of: an analytics algorithm update, a machine learning (ML) model, and ML training data; and executing the analytics component with the update. Other solutions include: performing intelligent compression on collected images, wherein the intelligent compression process determines data to transmit to a ground station, based at least on content of the collected images; and transmitting the data to the ground station.

<claims>
1. A system for performing on-platform analytics for collected images, the system comprising:
a processor; and
a computer-readable medium storing instructions that are operative when executed by the processor to:
package an analytics component for on-platform execution by a platform in orbit;
transmit, from a ground station to the platform, at least one update selected from the list consisting of:
an analytics algorithm update, a machine learning (ML) model update, and ML training data update; and
execute the analytics component with the update.
2. The system of claim 1 wherein the instructions are further operative to:
determine a need for an update to the packaged analytics component;
determine platform availability for communication; and
based at least on an expected navigational path of the platform, schedule communication with the platform.
3. The system of claim 2 wherein the update replaces an existing ML model on-board the platform.
4. The system of claim 1 wherein the update comprises synthetic training data.
5. The system of claim 1 wherein the instructions are further operative to:
transmit at least a portion of the update from the platform to a second orbital platform.
6. The system of claim 5 wherein the instructions are further operative to:
executing, with an analytics component on the second orbital platform, the update.
7. The system of claim 1 wherein the instructions are further operative to:
collect images by the platform; and
perform analytics on the collected images using the packaged analytics component.
8. A method of performing on-platform analytics for collected images, the method comprising:
packaging an analytics component for on-platform execution by a platform in orbit; transmitting, from a ground station to the platform, at least one update selected from the list consisting of:
an analytics algorithm update, a machine learning (ML) model update, and ML training data update; and
executing the analytics component with the update.
9. The method of claim 8 further comprising:
determining a need for an update to the packaged analytics component;
determining platform availability for communication; and
based at least on an expected navigational path of the platform, scheduling communication with the platform.
10. The method of claim 9 wherein the update replaces an existing ML model on board the platform.
11. The method of claim 8 wherein the update comprises synthetic training data.
12. The method of claim 8 further comprising:
transmitting at least a portion of the update from the platform to a second orbital platform.
13. The method of claim 12 further comprising:
executing, with an analytics component on the second orbital platform, the update.
14. The method of claim 8 further comprising:
collecting images by the platform; and
performing analytics on the collected images using the packaged analytics component.
15. One or more computer storage devices having computer-executable instructions stored thereon for performing on-platform analytics for collected images, which, on execution by a computer, cause the computer to perform operations comprising:
packaging an analytics component for on-platform execution by a platform in orbit;
transmitting, from a ground station to the platform, at least one update selected from the list consisting of:
an analytics algorithm update, a machine learning (ML) model update, and ML training data update; and
executing the analytics component with the update.
