</title>

<abstract>
Provided herein are methods, processes and apparatuses for non-invasive assessment of genetic variations.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for determining the presence or absence of a fetal aneuploidy, comprising: (a) sequencing circulating cell-free nucleic acid from a test sample from a pregnant female bearing a fetus by a sequencer that generates sequence reads for the test sample; (b) mapping the sequence reads to a subset of genomic sections of a reference genome, wherein: (i) the subset consists essentially of genomic sections to which an enriched amount of reads from fetal nucleic acid fragments are mapped, and (ii) the subset of genomic sections was selected according to a fragment length ratio X/Y for each genomic section, wherein: X is the sum of reads that (1) map to the genomic section, and (2) are from nucleic acid fragments that are shorter than a first selected fragment length; and Y is the sum of reads that (1) map to the genomic section, and (2) are from nucleic acid fragments that are shorter than a second selected fragment length; (c) calculating the amount of sequence reads mapped to the subset of genomic sections; and (d) outputting a classification of the presence or absence of a fetal aneuploidy according to the amount calculated in (c).
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising comparing the amount of sequence reads in (c), or derivative thereof, to a threshold value, thereby providing a comparison.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the presence or absence of a fetal aneuploidy is determined according to the comparison.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising normalizing the amount of sequence reads in (c) to adjust for guanine and cytosine (GC) bias.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the genomic sections are each a predetermined length of contiguous nucleotides.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the genomic sections are each about 50 kb in length.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the subset of genomic sections was selected according to an average fragment length ratio for each genomic section.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the subset of genomic sections was selected according to a median fragment length ratio for a plurality of genomic sections.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the subset of genomic sections consists essentially of genomic sections having an average fragment length ratio that is greater than the median fragment length ratio.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the first selected fragment length is about 160 bases or less.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the first selected fragment length is about 150 bases or less.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the first selected fragment length is about 140 bases or less.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the second selected fragment length is about 1000 bases or less.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the second selected fragment length is about 600 bases or less.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein about 30% to about 70% of sequence reads are mapped to the subset of genomic sections.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein sequence coverage and/or sequence read count for sequence reads mapped to the subset of genomic sections is reduced by about 60% to about 85%.
17. The method of claim 1, wherein the subset of genomic sections is selected from genomic sections in TABLE 4.
18. The method of claim 1, wherein the subset of genomic sections of a reference genome consisting essentially of genomic sections to which an enriched amount of reads from fetal nucleic acid fragments are mapped consists essentially of genomic sections to which a significant amount of reads from nucleic acid fragments shorter than about 150 bases are mapped.
19. The method of claim 1, wherein the fetal aneuploidy is trisomy 21, trisomy 18, or trisomy 13.
20. The method of claim 1, wherein the sequencer that generates sequence reads for the test sample is a genome-wide massively parallel sequencer.
