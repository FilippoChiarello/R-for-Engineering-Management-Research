<title>
SOLAR ARRAY FAULT DETECTION, CLASSIFICATION, AND LOCALIZATION USING DEEP NEURAL NETS
</title>

<abstract>
Solar array fault detection, classification, and localization using deep neural nets is provided. Embodiments use a cyber-physical system (CPS) approach to fault detection in photovoltaic (PV) arrays. Customized neural network algorithms are deployed in feedforward neural networks for fault detection and identification from monitoring devices that sense data and actuate at each individual module in a PV array. This approach improves efficiency by detecting and classifying a wide variety of faults and commonly occurring conditions (e.g., eight faults/conditions concurrently) that affect power output in utility scale PV arrays.
