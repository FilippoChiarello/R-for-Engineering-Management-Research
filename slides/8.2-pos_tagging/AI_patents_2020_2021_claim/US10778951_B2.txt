Camerawork generating method and video processing device
</title>

<abstract>
A camerawork generating method includes: generating, from a multi-view video of a same scene captured from different viewpoints, a three-dimensional model for the scene; determining a target scene which is included in the scene and is a target for which a free-viewpoint video of the three-dimensional model as viewed from a virtual camera is to be generated; and generating a camerawork representing a temporal change in a position and an orientation of the virtual camera in the free-viewpoint video.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A camerawork generating method, comprising: generating, from a multi-view video of a same scene captured from different viewpoints, a three-dimensional model for the scene; determining a target scene that is a target for which a free-viewpoint video of the three-dimensional model as viewed from a virtual camera is to be generated, the target scene being included in the scene; generating a camerawork representing a temporal change in a position and an orientation of the virtual camera in the free-viewpoint video; receiving a user input to acquire an evaluation of the camerawork; and generating another camerawork based on the evaluation.
2. The camerawork generating method according to claim 1, wherein in the determining of the target scene, the target scene is determined using one of the multi-view video and the three-dimensional model.
3. The camerawork generating method according to claim 1, wherein in the determining of the target scene, the target scene is determined using sound of the scene.
4. The camerawork generating method according to claim 1, wherein in the generating of the camerawork, the position and the orientation of the virtual camera are determined such that an object of a predetermined type associated with the target scene is included in the free-viewpoint video.
5. The camerawork generating method according to claim 1, wherein in the generating of the camerawork, the position and the orientation of the virtual camera are determined based on a quality of a plurality of portions included in the three-dimensional model.
6. The camerawork generating method according to claim 1, further comprising: displaying the camerawork.
7. The camerawork generating method according to claim 1, further comprising: generating the free-viewpoint video from one of the three-dimensional model and the multi-view video, using the camerawork.
8. The camerawork generating method according to claim 7, wherein in the generating of the free-viewpoint video, a shake is added to the free-viewpoint video.
9. A video processing device, comprising: a processor; and a non-transitory memory having stored thereon executable instructions, which when executed, cause the processor to perform: generating, from a multi-view video of a same scene captured from different viewpoints, a three-dimensional model for the scene; determining a target scene that is a target for which a free-viewpoint video of the three-dimensional model as viewed from a virtual camera is to be generated, the target scene being included in the scene; and generating a camerawork representing a temporal change in a position and an orientation of the virtual camera in the free-viewpoint video; receiving a user input to acquire an evaluation of the camerawork; and generating another camerawork based on the evaluation.
10. A camerawork generating method, comprising: generating, from a multi-view video of a same scene captured from different viewpoints, a three-dimensional model for the scene; determining a target scene that is a target for which a free-viewpoint video of the three-dimensional model as viewed from a virtual camera is to be generated, the target scene being included in the scene; and generating a camerawork representing a temporal change in a position and an orientation of the virtual camera in the free-viewpoint video, wherein in the generating of the free-viewpoint video, a shake is added to the free-viewpoint video.
