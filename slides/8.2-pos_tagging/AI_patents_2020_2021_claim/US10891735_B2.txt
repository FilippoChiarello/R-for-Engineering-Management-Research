<title>
Generation of synthetic high-elevation digital images from temporal sequences of high-elevation digital images
</title>

<abstract>
Implementations relate to detecting/replacing transient obstructions from high-elevation digital images, and/or to fusing data from high-elevation digital images having different spatial, temporal, and/or spectral resolutions. In various implementations, first and second temporal sequences of high-elevation digital images capturing a geographic area may be obtained. These temporal sequences may have different spatial, temporal, and/or spectral resolutions (or frequencies). A mapping may be generated of the pixels of the high-elevation digital images of the second temporal sequence to respective sub-pixels of the first temporal sequence. A point in time at which a synthetic high-elevation digital image of the geographic area may be selected. The synthetic high-elevation digital image may be generated for the point in time based on the mapping and other data described herein.
