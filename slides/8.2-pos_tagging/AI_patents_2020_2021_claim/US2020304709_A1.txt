ELECTRONIC DEVICE AND OPERATING METHOD THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
An electronic device is provided. The electronic device includes a camera, a display, a processor electrically coupled with the camera and the display, and a memory electrically coupled with the processor. The memory is configured to store instructions which, when executed, instruct the processor to, when a photographing request signal is received, estimate a motion of a subject within an image that is acquired by the camera, when the motion of the subject within the image acquired by the camera is not recognized, control the camera to capture a first type image by applying a first photographing condition, and when the motion of the subject within the image acquired by the camera is recognized, control the camera to capture a second type image by applying a second photographing condition.

<claims>
1. An electronic device comprising: a camera; a display; a processor operatively coupled with the camera and the display; and a memory operatively coupled with the processor, wherein the memory is configured to store instructions which, when executed, cause the processor to: in response to a photographing function being executed, control the display to display a preview image that is acquired by the camera, determine whether a motion of a subject within the preview image is recognized, and when the motion of the subject within the preview image is recognized, control the camera to continuously capture the subject by applying a predefined photographing condition while the motion of the subject is recognized.
2. The electronic device of claim 1, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to: when the motion of the subject within the preview image is not recognized, control the camera to capture the subject by applying another photographing condition in response to a user's input.
3. The electronic device of claim 1, wherein the predefined photographing condition comprises at least one of a photographing interval time or an exposure time.
4. The electronic device of claim 1, further comprising: a sensor configured to detect a motion of the electronic device, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to, when the motion of the electronic device is detected through the sensor, control the camera to capture the subject by applying another photographing condition.
5. The electronic device of claim 1, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to, when an emotion change of the subject within the preview image is recognized, control the camera to capture the subject by applying another photographing condition.
6. The electronic device of claim 1, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to: group images that are similar among continuously captured images, suggest a set number of images as recommend images by filtering the grouped images, and store the suggested images.
7. The electronic device of claim 6, wherein the filtered images comprise blur images.
8. The electronic device of claim 2, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to: based on a user's input, display thumbnail images of captured images by the electronic device or the user's input in a portion area of the display.
9. The electronic device of claim 8, wherein the portion area of the display comprises an edge area of the display.
10. The electronic device of claim 8, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to: display the images captured by the user's input from the images captured by the electronic device distinguishably.
11. A method of an electronic device, the method comprising: in response to a photographing function is executed, displaying a preview image that is acquired by a camera; determining whether a motion of a subject within the preview image is recognized; and when the motion of the subject within the preview image is recognized, controlling the camera to continuously capture the subject by applying a predefined photographing condition while the motion of the subject is recognized.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising: when the motion of the subject within the preview image is not recognized, controlling the camera to capture the subject by applying another photographing condition in response to a user's input.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the predefined photographing condition comprises at least one of a photographing interval time or an exposure time.
14. The method of claim 11, further comprising: detecting a motion of the electronic device using a sensor; and in response to the motion of the electronic device is detected, controlling the camera to capture the subject by applying another photographing condition.
15. The method of claim 11, further comprising: recognizing an emotion of the subject within the preview image; and when an emotion change of the subject is recognized, controlling the camera to capture the subject by applying another photographing condition.
16. The method of claim 11, further comprising: grouping images that are similar among continuously captured images; filtering the grouped images; suggesting a set number of images of the filtered images as recommend images; and storing the suggested images.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the filtering of the grouped images comprises filtering blur images.
18. The method of claim 12, further comprising: based on a user's input, displaying thumbnail images of captured images by the electronic device or the user's input in a portion area of the display.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the portion area of the display comprises an edge area of the display.
20. The method of claim 18, wherein displaying the thumbnail images of captured images by the electronic device or the user's input: displaying the images captured by the user's input from the images captured by the electronic device distinguishably.
