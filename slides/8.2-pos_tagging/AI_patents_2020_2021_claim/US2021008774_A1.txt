<title>
Method for the Automatic Process Monitoring and Process Diagnosis of a Piece-Based Process (batch production), in Particular an Injection-Moulding Process, and Machine That Performs the Process or Set of Machines that Performs the Process
</title>

<abstract>
A method for the automatic process monitoring and/or process diagnosis of a piece-based process, in particular a production process, in particular an injection-molding process, including the steps: a) performing an automated reference finding in order to obtain reference values (r1 . . . rn) from values (x0 . . . xj) of at least one process variable; b) performing an anomaly detection on the basis of the reference values (r1 . . . rn) found in step (a); c) performing an automated cause analysis and/or an automated fault diagnosis on the basis of a qualitative model of process relationships and/or on the basis of dependencies of various process variables on each other.

<claims>
1. A method for the automatic process monitoring and/or process diagnosis of a piece-based process, comprising an injection-moulding process with the steps: a) performing an automated reference finding in order to obtain reference values (r1 . . . rn) from values (x0 . . . xj) of at least one process variable; b) performing an anomaly detection for the detection of extraordinary values on the basis of the reference values (r1 . . . rn) found in step (a); and c) performing an automated cause analysis for determining causes of the anomaly and/or an automated fault diagnosis for diagnosis of process faults and process variable faults on a basis of a qualitative model of process relationships.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein a result of the cause analysis and/or of the fault diagnosis is emitted at an output device or a result of the cause analysis/fault diagnosis is further processed in an automated manner, in at least one of a machine control and/or in a control of a set of machines and/or in a control for influencing a machine environment.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein step a) comprises at least one or more of the sub-steps listed below: a1) Evaluation of process values x0 . . . xj of process variables over several process cycles with regard to their suitability for use as reference through the calculation of evaluation indices b1 . . . bi and application of established rules, wherein as evaluation indices b1 . . . bi including the change trend of the values x0 . . . xj of the process variables, and/or fluctuations of the process variables are used or a2) as reference of the automatic process monitoring and/or automatic process diagnosis, automatically determined reference values r1 . . . rn are used, which reflect the 'natural' noise or uncertainty of the process variable, which each process variable has owing to environmental conditions and/or sensor noise, or a3) when the provisional reference values r*1 . . . r*n formed from the process values x0 . . . xj of process variables on the basis of criteria and rules are better than the currently best found reference values r1 . . . rn, these are set up as new best found reference values r1 . . . rn or a4) the reference values r1 . . . rn of step a3) are used in order to automatically detect, evaluate and/or if applicable mark e.g. jumps, increases, outliers as anomalies or a5) wherein the automatic reference, i.e. the reference values r1 . . . rn in the case of predetermined events is compulsorily newly formed, wherein such predetermined events can be for example a longer standstill of the machine carrying out the process or a tool change.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein a reference generator, which is equipped with an initial reference, is assigned to each process variable.
5. The method according to claim 4, wherein a reference consists of several reference values (r1 . . . rn), wherein the reference values (r1 . . . rn) reflect characteristics of a value progression of values (x0 . . . xj) of the process variable, including the standard deviation and/or the median of the value.
6. The method according to claim 4, wherein during the sequence of the process, the reference values (r1 . . . rn) is adapted to the process variable progression which is determined by measurement, wherein for this a window of j values of the process variable is taken into consideration.
7. The method according to claim 6, wherein from the j values of the process variable (j) provisional reference values (r1* . . . rn*) and evaluation numbers (b1 . . . bi) are formed.
8. The method according to claim 7, wherein the evaluation numbers (b1 . . . bi) are derivations, including the increase or the curve of the progression of the j values of the process variable over time.
9. The method according to claim 7, wherein from the evaluation numbers (b1 . . . bi) of the current reference values (r1 . . . rn) and of the provisional reference values (r1* . . . rn*) it is established by means of predetermined rules whether the current reference values (r1 . . . rn) are maintained or in future the provisional reference values (r1* . . . rn*) is used as new current reference values (r1 . . . rn).
10. The method according to claim 1, wherein for each process variable an anomaly detection is provided, which uses the current reference values (r1 . . . rn) and or past values of the process variable (x1 . . . xk), in order to establish an extraordinary value, including an anomaly, or to evaluate it with regard to its probability.
11. The method according to claim 1, wherein a value of a process variable (x0), which has a predetermined distance from current reference values (r1 . . . rn), which lies more than three reference standard deviations away from the reference mean value, is characterized as "anomaly".
12. The method according to claim 1, wherein the qualitative model used in step c) qualitative model of an injection-moulding process is used, in which relationships between the process variables and/or dependencies between the process variables are contained.
13. A machine, comprising an injection-moulding machine, which has a machine control and devices for the monitoring and/or measuring of process variables, wherein the machine is set up and configured to perform the method according to claim 1.
14. A set of machines, comprising a set of injection-moulding machines, which has a machine control and devices for the monitoring and/or measuring of process variables, wherein the set of machines is set up and configured to perform the method according to claim 1.
