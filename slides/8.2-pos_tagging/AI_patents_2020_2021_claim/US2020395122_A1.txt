HEALTH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND PROGRAM FOR SAME
</title>

<abstract>
A healthcare system capable of ingesting hydrogen, oxygen, or the like required based on a vital sign of a user by ingestion with a portable gas generator, whereby the healthcare system can ingest an appropriate gas according to the physical condition of the user. The healthcare system includes: a portable gas generator capable of orally suctioning a gas selected from hydrogen and/or a mixed gas of a gas having an effect of promoting neural activity and/or blood circulation activity of an oxygen-containing living body, the gas being produced by electrolysis of an electrolyte filled in an internal electrolysis tank of the healthcare system; and a wearable portable terminal capable of detecting a vital sign that has been fixed in contact with a part of a human body part and has been digitized.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A healthcare system comprising: a portable gas generator capable of suctioning a selected gas among mixed gases containing hydrogen and/or oxygen, which are produced by electrolysis of an electrolyte filled in at least an electrolysis tank provided inside, for a predetermined period of time by spontaneous respiration, wherein said mixed gas having an effect of promoting neural activity and/or circulatory activity of a living body; and a wearable portable terminal for detecting a vital sign that is digitized by contacting and fixing a part of a body part.
2. A program for use in a healthcare system according to claim 1, comprising: a detecting means for detecting the vital signs that are digitized by contacting and fixing the wearable portable terminal to a part of a human body part; a first wireless transmitting means for wirelessly transmitting the vital signs to the outside; and a calculating means for calculating a required gas and gas discharge amount and/or time that are set in advance in accordance with each of the vital signs detected by the wearable portable terminal, and further comprising any one of the following (1), (2) and (3): (1) second wireless transmission means for wirelessly transmitting the required gas discharged from the gas generator and the gas discharge amount and/or time to the outside; (2) control signal transmitting means for transmitting a control signal based on the calculated required gas and gas discharge amount and/or time, and control means for receiving the control signal to control the power supply of the portable gas generator; and (3) second wireless transmission means for wirelessly transmitting the required gas and the gas discharge amount and/or time discharged from the gas generator to the outside, control signal transmission means for transmitting a control signal based on the calculated required gas and gas discharge amount and/or time, and control means for receiving the control signal and controlling the power supply of the portable gas generator.
3. The program of claim 2, wherein the wearable portable terminal comprises the calculating means.
4. The portable gas generator according to claim 1, comprising: a body cover member having a battery, a control board for controlling power supply from the battery; and a pair of anode electrodes energized or blocked an anode and cathode of battery by the control board; a water reservoir electrolysis tank detachably attached to the body cover member, the pair of anode electrodes are inserted into the interior in a mounted state; a nozzle portion having a through hole; and a mixing portion having a flow path for fluidly connecting nozzle portion and an end portion of the electrolysis tank and introducing atmosphere.
5. A portable gas-generator as claimed in claim 2, comprising: a body cover member having a battery, a control board for controlling power supply from the battery; and a pair of anode electrodes energized or blocked an anode and cathode of battery by the control board; a water reservoir electrolysis tank detachably attached to the body cover member, the pair of anode electrodes are inserted into the interior in a mounted state; a nozzle portion having a through hole; and a mixing portion having a flow path for fluidly connecting nozzle portion and an end portion of the electrolysis tank and introducing atmosphere.
