<title>
Scene understanding using a neurosynaptic system
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the invention provide a method for scene understanding based on a sequence of image frames. The method comprises converting each pixel of each image frame to neural spikes, and extracting features from the sequence of image frames by processing neural spikes corresponding to pixels of the sequence of image frames. The method further comprises encoding the extracted features as neural spikes, and classifying the extracted features.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: for an image frame comprising an object: converting, utilizing a first neurosynaptic core circuit, at least one pixel of at least one region of the image frame into at least one neural spike based on an intensity value of the at least one pixel; generating a map identifying the at least one region of the image frame that features are extracted from by processing, utilizing a second neurosynaptic core circuit, each neural spike that the at least one pixel is converted into; and detecting, utilizing a third neurosynaptic core circuit, the object in the image frame based on the map; wherein each neurosynaptic core circuit comprises a plurality of electronic synapse devices interconnecting a plurality of electronic neurons to a plurality of electronic axons, and the plurality of electronic synapse devices have opposing synaptic weights.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein pixels within the at least one region of the image frame are converted into one or more neural spikes if the pixels have different intensity values.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the one or more neural spikes encode one or more salient features extracted from the at least one region of the image frame.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the one or more neural spikes encode one or more discriminative features extracted from the at least one region of the image frame.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein pixels within the at least one region of the image frame are not converted into neural spikes if the pixels have the same intensity values.
6. A system comprising: at least one processor; and a non-transitory processor-readable memory device storing instructions that when executed by the at least one processor causes the at least one processor to perform operations including: for an image frame comprising an object: converting, utilizing a first neurosynaptic core circuit, at least one pixel of at least one region of the image frame into at least one neural spike based on an intensity value of the at least one pixel; generating a map identifying the at least one region of the image frame that features are extracted from by processing, utilizing a second neurosynaptic core circuit, each neural spike that the at least one pixel is converted into; and detecting, utilizing a third neurosynaptic core circuit, the object in the image frame based on the map; wherein each neurosynaptic core circuit comprises a plurality of electronic synapse devices interconnecting a plurality of electronic neurons to a plurality of electronic axons, and the plurality of electronic synapse devices have opposing synaptic weights.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein pixels within the at least one region of the image frame are converted into one or more neural spikes if the pixels have different intensity values.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the one or more neural spikes encode one or more salient features extracted from the at least one region of the image frame.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein the one or more neural spikes encode one or more discriminative features extracted from the at least one region of the image frame.
10. The system of claim 6, wherein pixels within the at least one region of the image frame are not converted into neural spikes if the pixels have the same intensity values.
11. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by at least one processor of a machine, cause the machine to perform operations comprising: for an image frame comprising an object: converting, utilizing a first neurosynaptic core circuit, at least one pixel of at least one region of the image frame into at least one neural spike based on an intensity value of the at least one pixel; generating a map identifying the at least one region of the image frame that features are extracted from by processing, utilizing a second neurosynaptic core circuit, each neural spike that the at least one pixel is converted into; and detecting, utilizing a third neurosynaptic core circuit, the object in the image frame based on the map; wherein each neurosynaptic core circuit comprises a plurality of electronic synapse devices interconnecting a plurality of electronic neurons to a plurality of electronic axons, and the plurality of electronic synapse devices have opposing synaptic weights.
12. The computer-readable medium of claim 11, wherein pixels within the at least one region of the image frame are converted into one or more neural spikes if the pixels have different intensity values.
13. The computer-readable medium of claim 12, wherein the one or more neural spikes encode one or more salient features extracted from the at least one region of the image frame.
14. The computer-readable medium of claim 12, wherein the one or more neural spikes encode one or more discriminative features extracted from the at least one region of the image frame.
15. The computer-readable medium of claim 11, wherein pixels within the at least one region of the image frame are not converted into neural spikes if the pixels have the same intensity values.
