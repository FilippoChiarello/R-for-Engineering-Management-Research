Image recognition method and system based on deep learning
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure discloses an image recognition method and system based on deep learning. The image recognition method trains a recognizing engine for high resolution images and a recognizing engine for low resolution image separately. The two recognizing engines generate two independent feature groups specifically for high resolution and low resolution images respectively. A categorizing engine categorizes a testing image to a high resolution mode or a low resolution mode, and then the testing image is recognized by the appropriate recognizing engine. Therefore, the present disclosure increases the accuracy of image recognition under various conditions.
