<title>
Multistage configuration trees for managing product family trees
</title>

<abstract>
A product line engineering (PLE) feature modeling structure called a multistage configuration tree that supports the engineering, deployment and maintenance of complex product family trees is provided. Feature selections and downselections are incrementally staged throughout the nodes in a product family tree. Feature decisions made at any node are inherited by all descendants of that node, thereby defining a product family subtree.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A product line management system comprising: a product family tree computer data structure, wherein the nodes of the product family tree are feature profiles and each node defines a subfamily; one or more partially bound feature profiles in the product family tree, the one or more partially bound feature profiles having some feature decisions that have been made and other feature decisions have not been made, and wherein the one or more partially bound feature profiles are present either as internal nodes or leaf nodes of the product family tree; one or more child nodes in the product family tree, wherein the one or more child nodes must inherit, must honor, and may not override feature decisions made by the respective parent of the one or more child nodes, and wherein the one or more child nodes may make additional feature decisions that further constrain the space of available feature choices; wherein downselection in a partially bound feature profile constrains the space of available feature choices by excluding from further consideration some feature decisions; wherein any direct connected path from a root node in the product family tree to a leaf node in the product family tree is a monotonically decreasing sequence of available feature choices; wherein a feature decision or downselection at an internal node in the product tree will be propagated by a computer algorithm to the children of the internal node, and wherein a feature decision or downselection at an internal node in the product tree will stop propagating feature decisions from a parent of the internal node to the children of the internal node and will instead propagate the feature decisions of the internal node to the children of the internal node; and wherein creation and modification of the product family tree computer data structure is performed using at least one processor.
2. A method comprising: receiving a selection or downselection decision at a profile on a node of a product family tree, wherein each node of the product family tree is a profile and each node defines a subfamily; wherein if the profile is a partially bound profile, then some decisions have been made and other decisions have not been made; wherein if the profile is a fully bound profile, all decisions have been made; therein if the node is a child node, the child node inherits and does not override decisions made by the parent node of the child node; downselecting a partially bound profile, thereby constraining the space of available choices by excluding some decisions from further consideration; decreasing monotonically the sequence of available choices on any directly connected path from a root node in the product family tree to a leaf node in the product family tree; wherein a decision at an internal node in the product tree will stop propagating changes from the internal node's parent to the children of the internal node and will instead propagate the decision to the children of the internal node; and wherein the creation and modification of the product family tree computer data structure is performed with at least one processor.
