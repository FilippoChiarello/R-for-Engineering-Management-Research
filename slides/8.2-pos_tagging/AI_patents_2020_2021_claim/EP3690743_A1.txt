TRAINING APPARATUS, TRAINING METHOD, AND TRAINING PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
An anomaly detection apparatus (10) performs training for the generator and the discriminator such that the generator maximizes a discrimination error of the discriminator and the discriminator minimizes the discrimination error The anomaly detection apparatus (10) stores, while the training is being performed, a state of the generator that is half-trained and satisfies a pre-set condition, and retrains the discriminator by using an image generated by the half-trained generator that has the stored state.

<claims>
1. A training apparatus (10) comprising: a generator (31) configured to generate image data; a discriminator (32) configured to discriminate whether the image data is real or fake;
a training unit (31,32) configured to perform training for the generator and the discriminator such that the generator maximizes a discrimination error of the discriminator and the discriminator minimizes the discrimination error; a storage unit (33) configured to, while the training is being performed, store a state of the generator that is half-trained and satisfies a pre-set condition; and a retraining unit (40) configured to retrain the discriminator by using an image generated by the half-trained generator that has the stored state.
2. The training apparatus (10) according to claim 1, wherein the storage unit (33) stores therein a state of the generator when a loss of the discriminator reaches a threshold or higher and thereafter reaches below the threshold again.
3. The training apparatus (10) according to claim 1, wherein
the discriminator (31) includes a first discriminator; and a second discriminator for which a faster training speed than a training speed of the first discriminator is set, the training unit (31,32) trains the generator so as to maximize a discrimination error of the first discriminator, trains the first discriminator so as to minimize the discrimination error of the first discriminator, and trains the second discriminator so as to minimize a discrimination error of the second discriminator, and
the storage unit (33) stores therein a state of the generator when a loss of the second discriminator increases and thereafter starts to decrease and when a loss of the first discriminator is equal to or larger than the threshold.
4. The training apparatus (10) according to claim 1, wherein the retraining unit (40) retrains, by using the state of the half-trained generator, a trained discriminator for which the training has been completed by the training unit.
5. The training apparatus (10) according to claim 1, wherein the retraining unit (40) performs retraining using the state of the half-trained generator, in parallel to the training performed by the training unit.
6. The training apparatus (10) according to claim 1, further comprising:
a detecting unit (50) configured to, when discrimination target image data is divided into a plurality of regions and input to the retrained discriminator, and if the retrained discriminator detects an anomaly, present a region that is indicated as anomalous by the retrained discriminator.
7. A training method comprising: performing training such that a generator configured to generate image data maximizes a discrimination error of a discriminator configured to discriminate whether the image data is real or fake; performing training such that the discriminator minimizes the discrimination error; storing, while the training is being performed, a state of the generator that is half-trained and satisfies a pre-set condition; and retraining the discriminator by using an image generated by the half-trained generator that has the stored state.
8. A training program causing a computer to execute: performing training such that a generator configured to generate image data maximizes a discrimination error of a discriminator configured to discriminate whether the image data is real or fake; performing training such that the discriminator minimizes the discrimination error; storing, while the training is being performed, a state of the generator that is half-trained and satisfies a pre-set condition; and retraining the discriminator by using an image generated by the half-trained generator that has the stored state.
