FLIGHT CONTROL FOR AN UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
A lightweight, pocket-sized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that can be held in an outstretched hand by a user for take-off and landing of the UAV. The UAV comprises a semi-toroidal or a substantially toroidal hollow body that defines a duct. The UAV further comprises a motor for rotating a fan that directs air into and out of the duct enabling UAV to take flight. The UAV comprises a flight-control system that comprises at least two flight control surfaces that can alter the directed air as it flows through the duct for controlling the roll and pitch and optionally the yaw of the UAV during flight. The flight control system may be controlled by a microprocessor controller. The UAV further comprises a payload, with at least a wireless transmitter and receiver unit.

<claims>
1. 1.-19. (canceled)
20. An unmanned aerial vehicle, comprising: a body that defines a duct with an upper end and a lower end that is opposite to the upper end, a vertical axis extending through a center of the body and from the upper end to the lower end; at least one electric motor; at least one fan within the duct that is operatively coupled to the at least one electric motor for rotating the at least one fan and creating an airflow into the upper end of the duct and out the lower end of the duct for creating thrust; at least two flaps; and a flight control system to drive, to change at least one of a direction, a pressure or a rate of the airflow at the lower end of the duct responsive to one or more instructions to control at least one of a pitch or a roll, one or more of the at least two flaps between a retracted position in the body and a protruded position out from the body and into an area of the duct adjacent the lower end.
21. The unmanned aerial vehicle of claim 20, wherein the flight control system is further configured to: drive the one or more of the at least two flaps between the retracted position in the body and the protruded position out from the body while maintaining one or more predetermined angles of incidence between the at least two flaps and the vertical axis extending through the center of the body.
22. The unmanned aerial vehicle of claim 20, wherein at least one of the at least two flaps are flat.
23. The unmanned aerial vehicle of claim 20, wherein at least one of the at least two flaps are concave.
24. The unmanned aerial vehicle of claim 20, wherein at least one of the at least two flaps are convex.
25. The unmanned aerial vehicle of claim 20, wherein at least one of the at least two flaps are configured to retract into a curvature.
26. The unmanned aerial vehicle of claim 20, wherein at least one of the at least two flaps are configured to retract or protrude along a fixed path.
27. The unmanned aerial vehicle of claim 20, wherein at least one of the at least two flaps comprises a curved region.
28. The unmanned aerial vehicle of claim 20, wherein the flight control system comprises at least one of a microprocessor, a wireless transmitter receiver unit, an electronic speed controller, an inertial measurement unit, a sensor, or an actuator.
29. The unmanned aerial vehicle of claim 20, wherein the flight control system comprises a microprocessor and a servomotor.
30. The unmanned aerial vehicle of claim 20, wherein at least a portion of the at least one of the at least two flaps comprises a curved region.
31. The unmanned aerial vehicle of claim 20, further comprising an actuator for each of the at least two flaps, the actuator for each of the at least two flaps operable to drive each of the at least two flaps from the retracted position to the protruded position.
32. The unmanned aerial vehicle of claim 20, wherein in the retracted position, the at least two flaps are flush with the body.
33. The unmanned aerial vehicle of claim 20, wherein a shape of the at least two flaps facilitates redirecting the airflow.
34. A method, comprising: providing an unmanned aerial vehicle comprising: a body that defines a duct with an upper end and a lower end that is opposite to the upper end, a vertical axis extending through a center of the body and from the upper end to the lower end; at least one electric motor; at least one fan within the duct that is operatively coupled to the at least one electric motor for rotating the at least one fan and creating an airflow into the upper end of the duct and out the lower end of the duct for creating thrust; and at least two flaps; and driving, by a flight control system, to change at least one of a direction, a pressure or a rate of the airflow at the lower end of the duct responsive to one or more instructions to control at least one of a pitch or a roll, one or more of the at least two flaps between a retracted position in the body and a protruded position out from the body and into an area of the duct adjacent the lower end.
35. The method of claim 34, comprising: driving, by the flight control system, the one or more of the at least two flaps between the retracted position in the body and the protruded position out from the body while maintaining one or more predetermined angles of incidence between the at least two flaps and the vertical axis extending through the center of the body.
36. The method of claim 34, wherein at least one of the at least two flaps have a shape that is flat, concave, or convex.
37. The method of claim 34, comprising: retracting at least one of the at least two flaps along a curvature.
38. The method of claim 34, wherein at least one of the at least two flaps comprises a curved region.
39. The method of claim 34, comprising: moving at least one of the at least two flaps between the retracted position and the protruded position along a fixed path.
