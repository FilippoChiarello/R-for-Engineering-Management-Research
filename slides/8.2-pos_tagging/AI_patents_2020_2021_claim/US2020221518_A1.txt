METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR ROUTINE BASED FOG NETWORKING
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and apparatus for organizing a distributed network based on routine usage data. In one exemplary embodiment, devices analyze routine usage data via e.g., machine learning and/or other heuristics to determine a set of routine rules and/or routine trigger conditions. Multiple devices may be assigned routine rules and/or routine trigger conditions that establish a fog network. Various described embodiments may incorporate time-shifted control plane operation and/or ledger-based control plane operation; these variants do not require central network management. Other optimizations may include dynamic selection of network topologies and/or routing technologies.

<claims>
1. A method for identifying fog networking opportunities, comprising: collecting user routine data; generating a routine rule and a routine trigger based on the user routine data; propagating the routine rule and the routine trigger to a first device and a second device; wherein responsive to an event that corresponds to the routine trigger: the first device and the second device establish a connection; and the first device and the second device execute the routine rule.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the generating the routine rule and the routine trigger based on the user routine data comprises: identifying an observable event trigger having a correlation to a future event that exceeds a minimum predictive value; assigning the routine trigger to the first device and the second device based on the observable event trigger; and assigning the routine rule to the first device and the second device based on the future event.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: determining the minimum predictive value based on a difference in demand for at least one of a time resource or a frequency resource from at least one of the first or the second device.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the routine rule and the routine trigger are associated with a termination clause; and wherein the first device and the second device deactivate the routine rule and the routine trigger when the termination clause.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the collecting the user routine data comprises: collecting a first set of user routine data at the first device; and receiving a second set of user routine data collected at the second device.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the collecting the user routine data is performed at salient points or conditional events identified by a user of the first device.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the collecting the user routine data comprises collecting a first set of user corresponding to the second device, at the first device.
8. A method for creating a fog network, comprising: responsive to an observable event that corresponds to a routine trigger, receiving control plane data at a first device from a second device; verifying the control plane data at the first device; when the control plane data is verified, establishing a connection between the first device and a second device based on the control plane data; and executing a routine rule at the first device via the connection.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the control plane data is time-shifted control plane data.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the time-shifted control plane data comprises a challenge or a response; and wherein the challenge or the response is received from a network entity via an out-of-band communication.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein the control plane data comprises a credit or debit to a ledger-based data structure.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the connection is based on medium access control (MAC) addresses.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the connection enables a device-to-device (D2D) network comprising a plurality of nodes.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the plurality of nodes of the D2D network are arranged in a ring network.
15. A user device, comprising: a processor apparatus; one or more wireless network interfaces coupled with the processor apparatus and configured to perform data communication in a fog network; a non-transitory computer-readable apparatus comprising a storage medium having at least one computer program thereon, the at least one computer program comprising a plurality of instructions configured to, when executed by the processor apparatus, cause the user device to: identify a routine trigger and a routine rule based on user routine data; propagate at least one of the routine trigger and the routine rule to at least one other device; and in response to an observable event that corresponds to the routine trigger, cause execution of the routine rule at the at least one other device.
16. The user device of claim 15, wherein the non-transitory computer-readable apparatus further comprises a data structure to store nonce data associated with the at least one other device; and wherein the nonce data associated with the at least one other device enables the data communication in the fog network.
17. The user device of claim 15, wherein the non-transitory computer-readable apparatus further comprises a data structure to store a distributed ledger of credits and/or debits.
18. The user device of claim 15, wherein the one or more wireless network interfaces are further configured to use medium access control (MAC) addresses in the fog network.
19. The user device of claim 15, wherein the one or more wireless network interfaces are further configured to use logical network addresses in the fog network.
20. The user device of claim 15, wherein the one or more wireless network interfaces are further configured to use medium access control (MAC) addresses in the fog network and use logical network addresses in a local area network (LAN).
