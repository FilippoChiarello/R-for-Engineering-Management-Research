<title>
MULTIMODE RESERVOIR
</title>

<abstract>
A passive photonics reservoir computing system comprises an optical waveguide based structure comprising a plurality of discrete nodes and a plurality of passive waveguide interconnections between the nodes for propagating the at least one photonic signal between the nodes, in which each discrete node is adapted for passively relaying the at least one photonic wave over the passive waveguide interconnections connected thereto, wherein the optical waveguide based structure comprises at least one multimode Y-junction configured for connecting three waveguides using a taper section wherein the taper section is not perfectly adiabatic. A training scheme uses a passive photonics computing system.
