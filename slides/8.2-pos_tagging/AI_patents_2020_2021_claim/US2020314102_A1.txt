<title>
Multi-blockchain network data processing
</title>

<abstract>
A data processing request is obtained containing blockchain data and an identifier used to identify a blockchain network to which the data processing request belongs. The identifier is extracted from the data processing request. Based on the identifier, corresponding processing logic associated with the data processing request is executed. The blockchain data is stored to a blockchain storage area corresponding to the identifier.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method, comprising: obtaining a data processing request at a blockchain node that is operating as a blockchain node in both a public blockchain network and an alliance-specific blockchain network, the data processing request containing an identifier used to identify the public blockchain network or the alliance-specific blockchain network as a blockchain network to which the data processing request belongs, wherein the blockchain node comprises a ledger for the public blockchain network and a ledger for the alliance-specific blockchain network; extracting the identifier from the data processing request; and executing, based on the identifier, corresponding processing logic associated with the data processing request.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising generating the identifier based on a network identifier of the blockchain network to which the data processing request belongs.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the data processing request comprises a data storage request message.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the data processing request comprises a data read request message.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, wherein executing corresponding processing logic associated with the data processing request comprises reading blockchain data from a blockchain storage area corresponding to the identifier.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the data processing request comprises a node communication message.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 6, further comprising, based on the identifier, exchanging the node communication message in the blockchain network to which the data processing request belongs.
8. A non-transitory, computer-readable medium storing one or more instructions executable by a computer system to perform operations comprising: obtaining a data processing request at a blockchain node that is operating as a blockchain node in both a public blockchain network and an alliance-specific blockchain network, the data processing request containing an identifier used to identify the public blockchain network or the alliance-specific blockchain network as a blockchain network to which the data processing request belongs, wherein the blockchain node comprises a ledger for the public blockchain network and a ledger for the alliance-specific blockchain network; extracting the identifier from the data processing request; and executing, based on the identifier, corresponding processing logic associated with the data processing request.
9. The non-transitory, computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein the operations comprise generating the identifier based on a network identifier of the blockchain network to which the data processing request belongs.
10. The non-transitory, computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein the data processing request comprises a data storage request message.
11. The non-transitory, computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein the data processing request comprises a data read request message.
12. The non-transitory, computer-readable medium of claim 11, wherein executing corresponding processing logic associated with the data processing request comprises reading blockchain data from a blockchain storage area corresponding to the identifier.
13. The non-transitory, computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein the data processing request comprises a node communication message.
14. The non-transitory, computer-readable medium of claim 13, wherein the operations comprise, based on the identifier, exchanging the node communication message in the blockchain network to which the data processing request belongs.
15. A computer-implemented system, comprising: one or more computers; and one or more computer memory devices interoperably coupled with the one or more computers and having tangible, non-transitory, machine-readable media storing one or more instructions that, when executed by the one or more computers, perform one or more operations comprising: obtaining a data processing request at a blockchain node that is operating as a blockchain node in both a public blockchain network and an alliance-specific blockchain network, the data processing request containing an identifier used to identify the public blockchain network or the alliance-specific blockchain network as a blockchain network to which the data processing request belongs, wherein the blockchain node comprises a ledger for the public blockchain network and a ledger for the alliance-specific blockchain network; extracting the identifier from the data processing request; and executing, based on the identifier, corresponding processing logic associated with the data processing request.
16. The computer-implemented system of claim 15, wherein the operations comprise generating the identifier based on a network identifier of the blockchain network to which the data processing request belongs.
17. The computer-implemented system of claim 15, wherein the data processing request comprises a data storage request message.
18. The computer-implemented system of claim 15, wherein the data processing request comprises a data read request message.
19. The computer-implemented system of claim 18, wherein executing corresponding processing logic associated with the data processing request comprises reading blockchain data from a blockchain storage area corresponding to the identifier.
20. The computer-implemented system of claim 15, wherein the data processing request comprises a node communication message.
21. The computer-implemented system of claim 20, wherein the operations comprise, based on the identifier, exchanging the node communication message in the blockchain network to which the data processing request belongs.
