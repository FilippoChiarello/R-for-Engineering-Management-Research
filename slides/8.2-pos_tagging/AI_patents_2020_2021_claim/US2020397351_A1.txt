LIGHT SOURCE DEVICE AND IMAGE-CAPTURING DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A light source device includes: a laser light source configured to emit laser light having a peak wavelength included in a wavelength range of light absorbed or reflected by a first region or a second region of an object under study, the laser light source being configured to form a speckle pattern having speckle contrasts that differ between the first region and the second region; and a speckle variable device configured to control a coherence of the laser light in response to an external control signal.

<claims>
1. A light source device comprising: a laser light source configured to emit laser light having a peak wavelength included in a wavelength range of light absorbed or reflected by a first region or a second region of an object under study, the laser light source being configured to form a speckle pattern having speckle contrasts that differ between the first region and the second region; and a speckle variable device configured to control a coherence of the laser light in response to an external control signal.
2. The light source device of claim 1, further comprising: a white light source configured to emit white light.
3. The light source device of claim 1, wherein: the laser light has a peak wavelength included in the visible light range.
4. The light source device of claim 1, wherein: the speckle variable device comprises: a diffuser disposed in an optical path of the laser light, and an actuator configured to move the diffuser to change an incident position of the laser light on the diffuser, wherein the actuator is configured to change an observed speckle contrast by changing the coherence of the laser light transmitted through or reflected by the diffuser, in response to the external control signal.
5. The light source device of claim 4, wherein: the diffuser has light scattering capability varying from position to position or from region to region.
6. The light source device of claim 5, wherein: the diffuser comprises a transparent portion.
7. The light source device of claim 4, wherein: the actuator is a motor configured to cause the diffuser to rotate, wobble, and/or vibrate.
8. The light source device of claim 7, wherein: the actuator is configured to change a position and/or movement velocity of the diffuser in response to the external control signal.
9. The light source device of claim 1, wherein: the peak wavelength of the laser light is closer to 555 nm than to an absorption peak wavelength in the wavelength range of light absorbed by the first region of the object.
10. The light source device of claim 1, wherein: the object is biological tissue, and the laser light source is a blue-violet laser diode.
11. The light source device of claim 1, further comprising: an optical system configured to optically couple an optical waveguide of an endoscope to the laser light in which coherence is controlled by the speckle variable device.
12. An image-capturing device comprising: the light source device according to claim 1; an imaging device; and a controller configured to control an operation of the light source device and an operation of the imaging device, wherein the controller is configured to send the external control signal to the speckle variable device of the light source device to change a speckle contrast in an image obtained by the imaging device.
