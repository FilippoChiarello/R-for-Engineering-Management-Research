<abstract>
A multiple-state health monitoring apparatus for critical components in a hoisting system includes a frame. The frame is a square structure formed by welding a plurality of rectangular steels. A steel wire rope is arranged around a periphery of the square structure. A power system, a friction-and-wear apparatus, a brake-and-wear apparatus, and a tensioning apparatus are sequentially mounted from left to right on a bottom layer of the square structure. A bearing signal collection system, a tension sensor, an excitation apparatus, and a steel-wire-rope image collection system are sequentially mounted from left to right on a top layer of the square structure. The steel wire rope sequentially passes through all the apparatuses or systems and is driven by the power system to perform circling. All the apparatuses or systems are used to monitor an operation status of the steel wire rope.
