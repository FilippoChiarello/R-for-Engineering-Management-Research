REDUCING INPUT REQUESTS IN RESPONSE TO LEARNED USER PREFERENCES
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments provide for reduced user input requests by identifying predefined diagnosis paradigms; creating a synthetic diagnosis paradigm via a machine learning process based on prior selections of action plans recommended by the predefined diagnosis paradigms and values entered therefor, wherein the synthetic diagnosis paradigm identifies the action plans to treat the plurality of conditions based on a subset of the attribute inputs used by the predefined diagnosis paradigms; generating a graphical user interface (GUI) to prompt input for values for the subset of attribute inputs; in response to receiving the values for the subset of attribute inputs, identifying at least one condition according to the predefined and synthetic diagnosis paradigms; and displaying the action plans in the GUI in association with the synthetic and predefined diagnosis paradigms according to evaluations of the action plans based on the respective logical structures.
</abstract>

<claims>
The claims are as follows:
1. A method comprising: identifying a plurality of predefined diagnosis paradigms that identify candidate action plans to treat a plurality of conditions, wherein each predefined diagnosis paradigm includes a logical structure that evaluates which conditions of the plurality of conditions to treat by which of the candidate action plans based on attribute inputs; creating a synthetic diagnosis paradigm via a machine learning process based on prior selections of the candidate action plans from the plurality of diagnosis paradigms and values entered for the attribute inputs on the prior selections of the candidate action plans, wherein the synthetic diagnosis paradigm identifies the candidate action plans to treat the plurality of conditions based on a subset of the attribute inputs used by the plurality of predefined diagnosis paradigms and includes a synthetic logical structure that evaluates which conditions of the plurality of conditions to treat; generating a graphical user interface (GUI) to prompt input for values for the subset of attribute inputs; in response to receiving the values for the subset of attribute inputs, identifying at least one condition of the plurality of conditions according to the plurality of predefined diagnosis paradigms and the synthetic diagnosis paradigm; and displaying the candidate action plans in the GUI in association with the synthetic diagnosis paradigm and the plurality of predefined diagnosis paradigms according to evaluations of the candidate action plans based on respective logical structures for the plurality of predefined diagnosis paradigms and the synthetic diagnosis paradigm, wherein the GUI highlights a preferred candidate action plan for each respective diagnosis paradigm of the plurality of predefined diagnosis paradigms and the synthetic diagnosis paradigm; and in response to receiving a selection in the GUI of a given candidate action plan other than one of the preferred candidate action plans, prompting, in the GUI, for input for additional values for the attribute inputs not included in the subset.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein displaying the candidate action plans in the GUI further comprises: generating a ranking of the plurality of predefined diagnosis paradigms and the synthetic diagnosis paradigm based on frequencies of prior selections of candidate action plans from each respective diagnosis paradigm; and ordering display of the respective diagnosis paradigms in the GUI based on the ranking.
3. (canceled)
4. (canceled)
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: in response to receiving the additional values, updating the GUI based on the additional values.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving a selection of a given candidate action plan from a given diagnosis paradigm that uses additional attribute inputs from those included in the subset of attribute inputs; and refraining from prompting for entry of any of the additional attribute inputs.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein particular attribute inputs comprising the subset of attribute inputs are selected from the plurality of predefined diagnosis paradigms based on an impact ranking of the particular attribute inputs to differentiate between conditions of the plurality of conditions.
8. A system comprising: a processor; and a memory storage device including instructions that when performed by the processor cause the system to: identify a plurality of predefined diagnosis paradigms that identify candidate action plans to treat a plurality of conditions, wherein each predefined diagnosis paradigm includes a logical structure that evaluates which conditions of the plurality of conditions to treat by which of the candidate action plans based on attribute inputs; create a synthetic diagnosis paradigm via a machine learning process based on prior selections of the candidate action plans from the plurality of diagnosis paradigms and values entered for the attribute inputs on the prior selections of the candidate action plans, wherein the synthetic diagnosis paradigm identifies the candidate action plans to treat the plurality of conditions based on a subset of the attribute inputs used by the plurality of predefined diagnosis paradigms and includes a synthetic logical structure that evaluates which conditions of the plurality of conditions to treat; generate a graphical user interface (GUI) to prompt input for values for the subset of attribute inputs; in response to receiving the values for the subset of attribute inputs, identify at least one condition of the plurality of conditions according to the plurality of predefined diagnosis paradigms and the synthetic diagnosis paradigm; and display the candidate action plans in the GUI in association with the synthetic diagnosis paradigm and the plurality of predefined diagnosis paradigms according to evaluations of the candidate action plans based on respective logical structures for the plurality of predefined diagnosis paradigms and the synthetic diagnosis paradigm, wherein the GUI highlights a preferred candidate action plan for each respective diagnosis paradigm of the plurality of predefined diagnosis paradigms and the synthetic diagnosis paradigm; and in response to receiving a selection in the GUI of a given candidate action plan other than one of the preferred candidate action plans, prompt, in the GUI, for input for additional values for the attribute inputs not included in the subset.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein to display the candidate action plans in the GUI, the instructions further cause the system to: generate a ranking of the plurality of predefined diagnosis paradigms and the synthetic diagnosis paradigm based on frequencies of prior selections of candidate action plans from each respective diagnosis paradigm; and order display of the respective diagnosis paradigms in the GUI based on the ranking.
10. (canceled)
