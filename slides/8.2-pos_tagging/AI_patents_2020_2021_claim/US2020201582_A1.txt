WAKING AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE, SUCH AS A PRINTER, FROM A SLEEP MODE BASED ON A USER POLICY AND PROXIMITY
</title>

<abstract>
Apparatus and method relating generally to controlling operation of one or more managed devices, such as printers, are disclosed. In such method, a radio frequency identification tag of a plurality of radio frequency identification tags within a first range is detected by a radio frequency identification reader of a printer. Tag information for the radio frequency identification tag is sent to a server. The tag information for a user is mapped to a user list on the server. A check for a policy for the user is made. The printer is waked from a sleep mode for operation by the user responsive to a determination the user is likely to use the printer responsive to the policy.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: detecting an identification tag of a plurality of identification tags within a first wireless range by a reader of an electronic device; sending tag information for the identification tag to a server; mapping the tag information for a user in a user list on the server; checking a policy for the user; waking the electronic device from a sleep mode for operation by the user responsive to a determination the user is likely to use the electronic device responsive to the policy; and sending the policy for the user from the server to an adaptive machine learning application.
2. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: updating the policy by the adaptive machine learning application; and sending the policy with an update from the adaptive machine learning application to the server as the policy.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein the checking of the policy comprises: determining by the server whether the user is likely to use the electronic device responsive to the policy; and initiating by the server the waking of the electronic device from the sleep mode for operation by the user responsive to a determination the user is likely to use the electronic device.
4. The method according to claim 3, wherein the checking further comprises determining presence of a credit for the user to use the electronic device.
5. The method according to claim 4, wherein the electronic device is a printer.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the printer is coupled to a network including other ones of managed printers.
7. The method according to claim 6, wherein the credit is for at least one of printing or scanning.
8. The method according to claim 4, wherein the checking is from an accounting application executed on the server.
9. The method according to claim 2, wherein the adaptive machine learning application is a backend application of a cloud-based system.
10. The method according to claim 9, further comprising updating a database of the cloud-based system with user information regarding the policy to store the update.
11. The method according to claim 10, wherein the updating includes adding information regarding day, time, and location of the user.
12. The method according to claim 2, further comprising: obtaining usage information associated with use of the electronic device after the waking thereof; and sending the usage information and the policy to the adaptive machine learning application.
13. The method according to claim 12, wherein: the adaptive machine learning application is a backend application of a cloud-based system; and the sending of the usage information is to the server and then on to the cloud-based system for the adaptive machine learning application.
14. The method according to claim 13, further comprising updating a database of the cloud-based system with the usage information in association with the policy for the user.
15. The method according to claim 14, wherein the usage information includes day, time, location, and operation of the electronic device by the user.
16. A system, comprising: a server having a memory and a processor; the memory configured to store program code; the processor, in response to executing the program code, configured to initiate operations to implement a change in a policy associated with a user responsive to detection of an identification tag associated with the user; an electronic device with a reader in communication with the server; wherein: the reader is configured to read a plurality of identification tags within a wireless range; the reader is configured to detect an identification tag of the identification tags associated with the user; the electronic device is configured to send tag information for the identification tag to the server; and the server is configured to execute the operations in order to: map the tag information to the user in a user list on the server; check the policy for the user; put the electronic device in an operational mode from a sleep mode for operation by the user responsive to a determination the user is likely to use the electronic device responsive to the policy; and send the policy for the user to an adaptive machine learning application for updating the policy for the user.
17. The system according to claim 16, wherein the server is configured to receive the policy with an update from the adaptive machine learning application as the policy.
18. The system according to claim 17, wherein the server is configured to determine whether the user is likely to use the electronic device responsive to the policy and initiate the operational mode of the electronic device from the sleep mode for operation by the user responsive to a determination the user is likely to use the electronic device.
19. The system according to claim 18, wherein the server is configured to obtain usage information from the electronic device associated with use of the electronic device in the operational mode by the user and send the usage information and the policy to the adaptive machine learning application.
20. The system according to claim 19, wherein the adaptive machine learning application is a backend application of a cloud-based system having a database with user information regarding the policy.
