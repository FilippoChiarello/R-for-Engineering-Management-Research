CYBER SECURITY THREAT MANAGEMENT
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the present invention provides a system to create a decentralized, scalable, blockchain powered cyber security management solution to monitor, protect themselves against and eliminate cyber threats, thereby managing cyber security. The cyber security management solution places an emphasis upon the strength of the wider community to contribute to finding vulnerabilities through a blockchain based mechanism. The cyber security management platform (such as Uncloak platform) may harness knowledge and expertise, aggregate it into the platform, and transform it into a service for end users. If the end user clients can understand their security risk position in real-time, they can place themselves in a strong position to eliminate cyber threats before they occur.

<claims>
1. A cyber security threat management system, comprising: an Uncloak platform, a threat detection engine, a threat detection database, a computing infrastructure associated with a customer, and a community of hunters, wherein: the threat detection engine is configured to crawl data sources including at least a public internet, a private internet, a dark web, and a social media platform to search for latest cyber security threat data that are formatted and stored in the threat detection database; the Uncloak platform is configured to scan the computing infrastructure of the customer to search for one or more vulnerabilities that are reported to the customer; the Uncloak platform is further configured to perform a check to determine whether the one or more vulnerabilities already exist as one or more cyber security threats in the threat detection database; the Uncloak platform is further configured to assign a task to a first set of hunters from the community of hunters to check for the one or more vulnerabilities, wherein the one or more vulnerabilities found by the set of hunters are validated by a second set of hunters from the community of hunters to determine if the one or more found vulnerabilities are valid or invalid; and the Uncloak platform is further configured to add the one or more found vulnerabilities as one or more new cyber vulnerabilities in the threat detection database, when the one or more found vulnerabilities are determined as valid.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the threat detection engine is further configured to translate and normalize unstructured raw data including the cyber security threat data, organize the normalized data into categories, remove irrelevant data from each category of the organized data to determine cyber security threats, and collate the similar cyber security threats and store the collated cyber security threats in the threat detection database.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the threat detection engine is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based threat detection engine that is communicatively connected to at least the public internet, the private internet, the dark web, and the social media platform.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the threat detection engine is further configured to create a decentralized, scalable, blockchain powered cyber security management solution to monitor, protect themselves against and eliminate cyber threats, thereby managing cyber security.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the Uncloak platform is further configured to manage cyber security threat or vulnerabilities based on a blockchain and/or AI powered technologies.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the Uncloak platform is further configured to facilitate a user dashboard to check progress of scans and reports, request external IT consultancy, and set up schedule scanning jobs, wherein the user dashboard is further utilized by users to scan their internal network for threats and vulnerabilities and report back to the Uncloak platform.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the Uncloak platform is further configured to reward a first quantity of tokens to the set of hunters for finding the one or more vulnerabilities and a second quantity of tokens to the second set of hunters for successfully validating the one or more vulnerabilities.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the first quantity of tokens is greater than the second quantity of tokens.
9. The system of claim 1, where each hunter of the community of hunters is an ethical hacker or a non-ethical hacker, who is a security expert or a software developer and who is registered on the Uncloak platform.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein one or more hunters of the community of hunters are allowed to perform cyber security threat hunting onto the Uncloak platform after successful registration, wherein the successful registration is performed by the Uncloak platform by successfully executing and validating at least an application of each hunter.
