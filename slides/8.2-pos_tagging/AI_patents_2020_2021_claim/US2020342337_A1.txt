MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIER FOR IDENTIFYING INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM WEBSITE TRACKING
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for identifying and classifying Visitor Information tracked on websites to identify Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and non-Internet Service Providers (non-ISPs). The technology employs machine intelligence to train a classifier on firmographically-enriched Visitor Intelligence from website tracking technology. The ISP classifier can distinguish ISPs from non-ISPs to identify website traffic for a given website that is attributable to ISPs.

<claims>
1. A method being performed by a computer system that comprises one or more processors and a computer-readable storage medium encoded with instructions executable by at least one of the processors and operatively coupled to at least one of the processors, the method comprising: obtaining website data traffic content including IP address data for a website; mapping the IP address data to a business entity identifier to identify a business entity associated with the website data traffic data; obtaining attribute data for each business entity associated with the business entity identifier to identify business attributes associated with the business entities mapped to the IP address data; generating a training data set from the website data traffic content and the attribute data for training an Internet Service Provider (ISP) classifier to identify ISPs associated with the mapped web traffic data; applying the ISP classifier to a database of website tracking data; and identifying website traffic for the website attributable to ISPs.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: obtaining a match acceptance rate of IP addresses from the website traffic data mapped to business entities identifiers; generating the training data set from the IP addresses from the website traffic data matched to the business entities identifiers.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: replacing the IP addresses from the website traffic data mapped to the business entities identifiers with previously identified IP addresses from the website traffic data that were previously mapped or matched to other business entities.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: generating a model for training the ISP classifier; training the model on the training data set; determining if the trained model accurately identifies ISPs; and if the model is accurate, applying the trained model as the ISP classifier.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein obtaining website data traffic content including IP address data for a website further comprises: placing a tracking code object on a website to be tracked; generating a log file identifying all IPs and cookies associated with the IPs tracked by the tracking code.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the web traffic data comprises, per IP address, a count of visits, unique visitors, and index customer count that accessed the website within a time window.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the time window comprises: a time window selected from the group consisting of: a weekly time interval, a bi-weekly interval, a monthly interval, a bi-monthly interval, and a quarterly interval.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the time window comprises: the monthly interval.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the attribute data for each business entity associated with the business entity identifier comprises firmographic data.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the firmographic data for attribute data comprises firmographic data selected from the group consisting of annual sales, an industry code, and employee count.
11. The method of claim 10 wherein the industry code comprises an SIC code, an NAICS code, or both.
12. The method of claim 4, wherein a feature set for the model for training the ISP classifier comprises features from the firmographic data for the attribute data and the web traffic data comprising: NAICS, SIC, unique visitors, visit count, employee count, annual sales, and an index customer count.
13. The method of claim 4, wherein the model comprises a model selected from the group consisting of a decision tree or a gradient boosting classifier.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the model comprises a gradient boosting classifier.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the gradient boosting classifier model {F} predicts values of the form y=F(x) by minimizing g, the mean squared error.
16. The method of claim 14, wherein the gradient boosting classifier comprises: at each stage m of gradient boosting (1<=m<=M) for model Fm predicting mean y in the training set, the gradient boosting algorithm adds an estimator b[Fm+1(x)=Fm(x)+b(x)], where Fm+1 (x)=Fm(x)+b(x)=y, wherein the gradient boosting fits b to the residual yâˆ’Fm(x).
17. The method of claim 14, wherein the gradient boosting classifier training comprises: iterating the gradient booster classifier for about 1000 iterations.
18. A computer program stored on a computer readable medium and loadable into the internal memory of a digital computer, comprising software code portions, when said program is run on a computer, for performing the method of claim 1.
19. A computer program product storing the computer program of claim 18.
20. A computer system comprising: a network computer, including: a transceiver for communicating over the network; a memory for storing at least instructions and a word database; and a processor device that is operative to execute instructions that enable actions, comprising: obtaining website data traffic content including IP address data for a website; mapping the IP address data to a business entity identifier to identify a business entity associated with the website data traffic data; obtaining attribute data for each business entity associated with the business entity identifier to identify business attributes associated with the business entities mapped to the IP address data; generating a training data set from the website data traffic content and the attribute data for training an Internet Service Provider (ISP) classifier to identify ISPs associated with the mapped web traffic data; applying the ISP classifier to a database of website tracking data; and identifying website traffic for the website attributable to ISPs.
