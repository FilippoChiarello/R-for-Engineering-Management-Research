<title>
Differentiation of messages for receivers thereof
</title>

<abstract>
A solution for sending messages on a data-processing system is proposed. A corresponding method comprises upon a message to be sent from a sender to at least one receiver being submitted, parsing the message to identify an original expression therein matching an indication of one of a set of pre-defined concepts, determining, for the receiver, a preferred expression of the matched concept, among the corresponding original expression and a set of candidate expressions pre-defined to express the matched concept, according to a rating thereof representing an expected understanding by the receiver, processing the message for the receiver by replacing the original expression according, to the corresponding preferred expression for the receiver, and sending the processed message to the corresponding receiver.
</abstract>

<claims>
We claim:
1. An apparatus for sending a message on a data-processing system, the apparatus comprising: a plurality of processors; a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium coupled to the plurality of processors; and logic, stored on the computer-readable storage medium and executed on the plurality of processors, for: parsing an electronic mail (email) message, sent from a sender for delivery to at least one receiver of a plurality of receivers, to identify at least one original expression therein matching an indication of a pre-defined concept, wherein the receiver is an email user and original expression is a complete sentence; determining, for the receiver, a preferred expression of the matched concept, among the corresponding original expression and a set of candidate expressions pre-defined to express the matched concept, according to a rating representing an expected understanding by the receiver, wherein the preferred expression does not include the original expression, wherein the preferred expression is set to an expression having the highest rating representing an expected understanding by the receiver when exceeding the rating of the original expression by a predefined threshold compared to the set of candidate expressions and the preferred expression is not a translation between languages; processing the message for the receiver by replacing the original expression with the corresponding preferred expression for the receiver; sending the processed message to the corresponding receiver; and displaying the processed message to the user.
2. The apparatus according to claim 1, the logic further comprising logic for: receiving an indication of an understanding feedback for at least part of preceding processed messages from at least part of the plurality of receivers, and using at least part of the corresponding understanding feedbacks for calculating the rating of an original expression and candidate expression.
3. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the logic for determining, for the receiver, a preferred expression of the matched concept comprises logic for: calculating the rating of the corresponding original expression and candidate expression according to a set of expression coefficients representing an expected understanding of an expression attribute thereof depending on the receiver.
4. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the logic for determining, for the receiver, a preferred expression of the matched concept comprises logic for: creating a further new candidate expression for the matched concept in response to no rating of the corresponding original expression and candidate expressions for the receiver reaching an understanding threshold, the rating of the further new candidate expression reaching the understanding threshold; and setting the further new candidate expression as the preferred expression.
5. A computer programming product for sending a message on a data-processing system, the computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having program code embodied therewith, the program code executable by a plurality of processors to perform a method comprising: parsing an electronic mail (email) message, sent from a sender for delivery to at least one receiver of a plurality of receivers, to identify at least one original expression therein matching an indication of a pre-defined concept, wherein the receiver is an email user and original expression is a complete sentence; determining, for the receiver, a preferred expression of the matched concept, among the corresponding original expression and a set of candidate expressions pre-defined to express the matched concept, according to a rating representing an expected understanding by the receiver, wherein the preferred expression does not include the original expression, wherein the preferred expression is set to an expression having the highest rating representing an expected understanding by the receiver when exceeding the rating of the original expression by a predefined threshold compared to the set of candidate expressions and the preferred expression is not a translation between languages; processing the message for the receiver by replacing the original expression with the corresponding preferred expression for the receiver; sending the processed message to the corresponding receiver; and displaying the processed message to the user.
6. The computer programming product according to claim 5, the method further comprising: receiving an indication of an understanding feedback for at least part of preceding processed messages from at least part of the plurality of receivers, and using at least part of the corresponding understanding feedbacks for calculating the rating of an original expression and candidate expression.
7. The computer programming product according to claim 5, wherein the determining, for the receiver, a preferred expression of the matched concept comprises: calculating the rating of the corresponding original expression and candidate expression according to a set of expression coefficients representing an expected understanding of an expression attribute thereof depending on the receiver.
8. The computer programming product according to claim 5, wherein the determining, for the receiver, a preferred expression of the matched concept comprises: creating a further new candidate expression for the matched concept in response to no rating of the corresponding original expression and candidate expressions for the receiver reaching an understanding threshold, the rating of the further new candidate expression reaching the understanding threshold; and setting the further new candidate expression as the preferred expression.
