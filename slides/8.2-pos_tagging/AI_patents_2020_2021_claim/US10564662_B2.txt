<title>
Systems and methods for determining pedal actuator states
</title>

<abstract>
A method of determining the state of a pedal actuator system within a vehicle includes receiving a position sensor signal indicative of a position of an actuator pedal within the pedal actuator system, receiving a force sensor signal indicative of a compressive force applied to the actuator pedal, and determining, with a processor, a state of the actuator pedal based on the position sensor signal and the force sensor signal. The state of the actuator pedal is one of a normal operating state and a fault state.

<claims>
1. A method of determining a state of a pedal actuator system within a vehicle, the method comprising: receiving a position sensor signal indicative of a position of an actuator pedal within the pedal actuator system; receiving a force sensor signal indicative of a compressive force applied to the actuator pedal; and determining, with a processor, a state of the actuator pedal based on a decision tree that evaluates the position sensor signal and the force sensor signal, wherein the state of the actuator pedal is one of a normal operating state and a fault state, wherein the decision tree: determines the state of the actuator pedal to be the fault state when the force sensor signal indicates a non-zero force, and the position sensor signal indicates that actuator pedal has not moved beyond a rest state; determines the state of the actuator pedal to be the fault state when the force sensor signal indicates zero force, and the position sensor signal indicates that the actuator pedal has moved beyond a rest state; and determines the state of the actuator pedal to be the normal operating state when the force sensor signal indicates a non-zero force, and the position sensor signal indicates that the actuator pedal has moved beyond a rest state.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the actuator pedal is a brake pedal.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the actuator pedal is an acceleration pedal.
4. The method of claim 1, further including performing a remedial action if the state of the actuator pedal is a fault state.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the remedial action includes at least one of providing a notification of the fault state, modifying the braking of the vehicle, and modifying an acceleration of the vehicle.
6. The method of claim 1, further performing a diagnostic test of the position sensor assembly and the force sensor assembly prior to determining the state of the actuator pedal.
7. A pedal state determination system for a vehicle, the system comprising: a pedal actuator system comprising an actuator pedal, a force sensor assembly configured to produce a force sensor signal indicative of a force applied to the actuator pedal, and a position sensor assembly configured to produce a position sensor signal indicative of the position of the actuator pedal; and a pedal state determination module, including a processor, configured to determine a state of the actuator pedal based on a decision tree that evaluates the position sensor signal and the force sensor signal, wherein the state of the actuator pedal is one of a normal operating state and a fault state, wherein the decision tree: determines the state of the actuator pedal to be the fault state when the force sensor signal indicates a non-zero force, and the position sensor signal indicates that actuator pedal has not moved beyond a rest state; determines the state of the actuator pedal to be the fault state when the force sensor signal indicates zero force, and the position sensor signal indicates that the actuator pedal has moved beyond a rest state; and determines the state of the actuator pedal to be the normal operating state when the force sensor signal indicates a non-zero force, and the position sensor signal indicates that the actuator pedal has moved beyond a rest state.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the actuator pedal is a brake pedal.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein the actuator pedal is an acceleration pedal.
10. The system of claim 7, further including performing a remedial action if the state of the actuator pedal is a fault state.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the remedial action includes at least one of providing a notification of the fault state, modifying the braking of the vehicle, and modifying an acceleration of the vehicle.
12. The system of claim 7, wherein the pedal state determination module performs a diagnostic test of the position sensor assembly and the force sensor assembly prior to determining the state of the actuator pedal.
13. A vehicle comprising: a pedal actuator system comprising an actuator pedal, a force sensor assembly configured to produce a force sensor signal indicative of a force applied to the actuator pedal, and a position sensor assembly configured to produce a position sensor signal indicative of the position of the actuator pedal; and a pedal state determination module, including a processor, configured to determine a state of the actuator pedal based on a decision tree that evaluates the position sensor signal and the force sensor signal, wherein the state of the actuator pedal is one of a normal operating state and a fault state, wherein the decision tree: determines the state of the actuator pedal to be the fault state when the force sensor signal indicates a non-zero force, and the position sensor signal indicates that actuator pedal has not moved beyond a rest state; determines the state of the actuator pedal to be the fault state when the force sensor signal indicates zero force, and the position sensor signal indicates that the actuator pedal has moved beyond a rest state; and determines the state of the actuator pedal to be the normal operating state when the force sensor signal indicates a non-zero force, and the position sensor signal indicates that the actuator pedal has moved beyond a rest state.
