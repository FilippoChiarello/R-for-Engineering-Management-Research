IMAGE PROCESSING APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
In an example, an apparatus comprising an image processor is configured to perform edge detection on the image to detect a plurality of edges, automatically identify a path across the image based on the detected plurality of edges, divide the image into two adjacent sub-images based on the determined path, and generate first and second print data to cause the printing device to print the two adjacent sub-images.

<claims>
1. A method of generating print data for a printing device, the method comprising: receiving image data of an image, the image being unprintable on a single print of the printing device; performing edge detection on the image to detect a plurality of edges; automatically identifying a path across the image based on the detected plurality of edges; dividing the image into two adjacent sub-images based on the determined path; and generating first and second print data to cause the printing device to print the two adjacent sub-images.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying a path across the image based on the detected plurality of edges further comprises: transforming each edge of the plurality of edges to a contour; generating a graph for the plurality of contours, wherein each contour is represented by a node in the graph, the graph having a plurality of arcs between the nodes, each arc representing the shortest distance between two nodes connected by that arc; determining a shortest path between a source node and a destination node in the graph.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein generating the graph further comprises for each node in the graph identifying a predetermined number of nearest other nodes and for each identified other node generating an arc representing the shortest distance between the node and the other node.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein determining the shortest path comprises determining the shortest path using the Dijkstra algorithm.
5. The method claim 1 further comprising: converting the received image data to grey-scale image data; and wherein performing edge detection on the image comprises performing edge detection on the grey-scale image data.
6. The method claim 1 further comprising: identifying a region of the image having a highest density of detected edges; and wherein the transforming, generating and determining are performed on image data corresponding with the identified region of the image.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the region of the image comprises a predetermined width.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein performing edge detection on the image comprises performing edge detection using the Canny edge detection algorithm.
9. The method claim 1, wherein dividing the image into two adjacent sub-images based on the determined path further comprises building first and second binary masks based on the determined path, wherein the first binary mask is an inverse of the second binary mask.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein dividing the image into two adjacent sub-images further comprises applying alpha blending to a border region of the first and second binary masks, the border region corresponding to the determined path.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein dividing the image into two adjacent sub-images further comprises multiplying the image by the first binary mask to generate a first sub-image and by the second binary mask to obtain the second sub-image.
12. The method of claim 1 further comprising printing the respective first and second sub-images on the printing device based on the first and second print data.
13. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to: receive image data of an image, the image being unprintable on a single print of a printing device; perform edge detection on the image to detect a plurality of edges; automatically identify a path across the image based on the detected plurality of edges; divide the image into two adjacent sub-images based on the determined path; and generate first and second print data to cause the printing device to print the two adjacent sub-images.
14. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 13, wherein the instructions, when executed by the one or more processors cause the one or more processors to: transform each edge of the plurality of edges to a contour; generate a graph for the plurality of contours, wherein each contour is represented by a node in the graph, the graph having a plurality of arcs between the nodes, each arc representing the shortest distance between two nodes connected by that arc; determine a shortest path between a source node and a destination node in the graph.
15. An apparatus comprising: a processor; and a memory storing instructions to: receive image data of an image, the image being unprintable on a single print of a printing device; perform edge detection on the image to detect a plurality of edges; transform each edge of the plurality of edges to a contour; generate a graph for the plurality of contours, wherein each contour is represented by a node in the graph, the graph having a plurality of arcs between the nodes, each arc representing the shortest distance between two nodes connected by that arc; determine a shortest path between a source node and a destination node in the graph; divide the image into two adjacent sub-images based on the determined shortest path; and generate first and second print data to cause the printing device to print the two adjacent sub-images;
