SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING TRAINING SETS FOR NEURAL NETWORKS
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for generating training sets for training neural networks. The method includes determining a segmentation based on a column from a columnar database table; generating a group-by query based on the segmentation; generating a plurality of reduced queries based on the group-by query; executing the group-by query on a table of a database to obtain a result table, wherein the result table includes a plurality of results, wherein each result corresponds to a respective reduced query of the plurality of reduced queries; and generating a plurality of training query pairs by pairing each reduced query with its corresponding reduced result.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for generating training sets for training neural networks, comprising: determining a segmentation based on a column from a columnar database table; generating a group-by query based on the segmentation; generating a plurality of reduced queries based on the group-by query; executing the group-by query on a table of a database to obtain a result table, wherein the result table includes a plurality of results, wherein each result corresponds to a respective reduced query of the plurality of reduced queries; and generating a plurality of training query pairs by pairing each reduced query with its corresponding reduced result.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the segmentation is based on dimensions.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the segmentation is based on measures.
4. The method of claim 4, further comprising: determining a distribution of values pertaining to the measures, wherein the segmentation is determined based on the distribution of values.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the group-by query further comprises: generating at least one nested query within the group-by query.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: generating a plurality of training queries based on a set of queries generated by at least one user.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein generating each training query further comprises: determining a variable element of a query of the set of queries; and determining a variance of the variable element, wherein the training query is generated based on the determined variable element and the determined variance.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: training a neural network at least partially using the plurality of training query pairs.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the neural network is further trained when a predicted result generated by the neural network differs from a real result generated based on a dataset above a threshold, further comprising: generating an updated predicted result based on the predicted result and the real result, wherein the updated predicted result is utilized as a training input to the neural network.
10. A non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon instructions for causing a processing circuitry to execute a process, the process comprising: determining a segmentation based on a column from a columnar database table; generating a group-by query based on the segmentation; generating a plurality of reduced queries based on the group-by query; executing the group-by query on a table of a database to obtain a result table, wherein the result table includes a plurality of results, wherein each result corresponds to a respective reduced query of the plurality of reduced queries; and generating a plurality of training query pairs by pairing each reduced query with its corresponding reduced result.
11. A system for generating training sets for training neural networks, comprising: a processing circuitry; and a memory, the memory containing instructions that, when executed by the processing circuitry, configure the system to: determine a segmentation based on a column from a columnar database table; generate a group-by query based on the segmentation; generate a plurality of reduced queries based on the group-by query; execute the group-by query on a table of a database to obtain a result table, wherein the result table includes a plurality of results, wherein each result corresponds to a respective reduced query of the plurality of reduced queries; and generate a plurality of training query pairs by pairing each reduced query with its corresponding reduced result.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the segmentation is based on dimensions.
