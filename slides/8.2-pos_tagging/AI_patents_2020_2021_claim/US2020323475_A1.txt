2. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the one or more possible user requirements comprises a level of reliability of detecting malingering and/or a number of physical and/or mental function tests in a set.
3. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the indication that the first subject may be malingering in the physical and/or mental function test is received from the user of the apparatus, or received from the testing device.
4. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processing unit is configured to receive the indication that the first subject may be malingering by: receiving a signal from the testing device relating to the completion of a physical and/or mental function test by the first subject; and processing the received signal to detect whether the first subject may be malingering.
5. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processing unit is further configured to: receive results for the first subject in completing the first set of physical and/or mental function tests; analyse the results to determine values for one or more parameters relating to the completion of each physical and/or mental function test in the first set by the first subject; and process the determined values to determine an indication of whether the first subject is malingering in one or more of the physical and/or mental function tests in the first set.
6. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processing unit is further configured to: receive population information relating to a plurality of subjects, the population information comprising results for the plurality of subjects in completing the plurality of different physical and/or mental function tests and an indication of whether the subject was malingering; and process the received population information to determine the plurality of models.
7. An apparatus as claimed in claim 6, wherein the processing unit is further configured to: receive user requirement information indicating a range of possible user requirements; and process the received population information and the received user requirement information to determine the plurality of models.
8. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processing unit is further configured to: in response to an indication indicating that the identified first set of physical and/or mental function tests did not detect whether the first subject is malingering, prompt the user of the apparatus to indicate a different user requirement for detecting malingering by the first subject; in response to receiving an indication of a different user requirement from the user, retrieve, from the memory unit, the identity of a second set of physical and/or mental function tests for a model that meets the indicated different user requirement; and output a control signal to the testing device indicating the retrieved identity of the second set of physical and/or mental function tests such that the function testing device provides the identified second set of physical and/or mental function tests to the first subject for completion.
9. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processing unit is further configured to: in response to an indication indicating that the identified first set of physical and/or mental function tests did not detect whether the first subject is malingering, determine that a difficulty level of one or more of the physical and/or mental function tests in the first set of physical and/or mental function tests is to be increased; and output a control signal to the testing device indicating the identity of the first set of physical and/or mental function tests and the increased difficulty level such that the testing device provides the identified first set of physical and/or mental function tests to the first subject for completion.
10. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the apparatus further comprises the testing device.
11. A computer-implemented method for use in detecting malingering by a first subject in a test of physical and/or mental function of the first subject, the method in a processing unit comprising: storing a plurality of models in a memory unit, each model identifies a respective set of physical and/or mental function tests from a plurality of different physical and/or mental function tests that can be used to detect malingering by a subject and that meets one or more possible user requirements for detecting malingering; receiving a user input from a user, the received user input indicating a user requirement for detecting malingering by the first subject; following receipt of an indication that the first subject may be malingering in one or more physical and/or mental tests, retrieving, from the memory unit, the identity of a first set of physical and/or mental function tests for a model that meets the indicated user requirement; and outputting a control signal to a testing device indicating the retrieved identity of the first set of physical and/or mental function tests such that the testing device provides the identified first set of physical and/or mental function tests to the first subject for completion.
