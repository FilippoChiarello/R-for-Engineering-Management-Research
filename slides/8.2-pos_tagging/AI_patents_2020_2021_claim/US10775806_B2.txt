<title>
Autonomous-vehicle dispatch based on fleet-level target objectives
</title>

<abstract>
In one embodiment, a method includes a computing system receiving information from an autonomous vehicle (AV). Based on the received information, the system may identify a target objective, with an associated target destination, for the AV and determine that the AV is able to transport passengers while furthering the target objective. The system may receive multiple ride requests from ride requestors, respectively. Each of the ride requests is associated with an origination location and a destination location. The system may match the AV with one of the ride requests based on a location of the AV, the target destination of the target objective, and the origination location and destination location associated with the ride request. The system may instruct the AV to perform a transportation task from the origination location to the destination location associated with the ride request, and drive to the target destination after completing the transportation task.

7. The method of claim 1, wherein the autonomous vehicle fulfills the ride request by travelling to the pick-up location and then the drop-off location.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining, based on the fleet-level objective, an alternative pick-up location or an alternative drop-off location for the ride request based on the determined location of the autonomous vehicle, the target destination, and the pick-up location or drop-off location associated with the ride request; sending an offer to the ride requestor, the offer being contingent upon the ride requestor agreeing to change the pick-up location to the alternative pick-up location or change the drop-off location to the alternative drop-off location; receiving an acceptance of the offer; and updating, in response to receiving the acceptance of the offer, (1) the pick-up location associated with the ride request to be the alternative pick-up location or (2) the drop-off location associated with the ride request to be the alternative drop-off location.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining a first route from the determined location of the autonomous vehicle to the target destination, wherein the first route is associated with a first estimated travel time; and determining a second route from the determined location of the autonomous vehicle to the pick-up location, from the pick-up location to the drop-off location, and from the drop-off location to the target destination, wherein the second route is associated with a second estimated travel time; wherein the ride request is matched with the autonomous vehicle further based on a determination that a difference between the first estimated travel time and the second estimated travel time satisfies a predetermined criterion.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining a first route from the determined location of the autonomous vehicle to the target destination, wherein the first route is associated with a first estimated proximity; and determining a second route from the drop-off location to the target destination, wherein the second route is associated with a second estimated proximity; wherein the ride request is matched with the autonomous vehicle further based on a determination that a difference between the first estimated proximity and the second estimated proximity satisfies a predetermined criterion.
11. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining a second location of the autonomous vehicle after the autonomous vehicle has fulfilled the ride request; wherein the instructing of the autonomous vehicle to travel to the target destination is based on a determination that the second location of the autonomous vehicle is within a threshold proximity from the target destination.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining a second location of the autonomous vehicle after the autonomous vehicle has fulfilled the ride request; determining that a proximity from the second location to the target destination exceeds a predetermined threshold; receiving a second ride request from a second ride requestor, wherein the second ride request is associated with a second pick-up location; in accordance with the fleet-level objective, matching the autonomous vehicle with the second ride request based on the second location of the autonomous vehicle, the target destination, and the second pick-up location associated with the second ride request; and instructing the autonomous vehicle to fulfill the second ride request before travelling to the target destination.
