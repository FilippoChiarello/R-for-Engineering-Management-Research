<title>
Flow indicator for an infusion pump
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided for signaling a condition of an infusion assembly. A system may comprise an elastomeric pump that includes a chamber for receipt of a volume of fluid, an outer layer configured to expand and contract as the chamber receives and dispenses fluid, and a passive indicator provided on the outer layer for signaling a change in the volume of fluid in the chamber. The system further may comprise an image capture device configured to capture an image of the pump, and a processing system configured to process the image to signal the condition of the infusion assembly to a user of the system. A method may comprise capturing an image of a pump; processing the image; and displaying information to a user of the pump to communicate the condition of the pump to the user. Elastomeric pumps for infusion assemblies also are provided.

<claims>
1. A system for signaling a condition of an infusion assembly, the system comprising: an elastomeric pump, the pump including an expandable bladder defining a chamber for receipt of a volume of fluid, the bladder configured to expand from a deflated position to an inflated position as the chamber receives fluid and contract as the chamber dispenses fluid, an expandable outer layer surrounding the bladder, the outer layer configured to expand as the chamber receives fluid and to contract as the chamber dispenses fluid, and a passive indicator provided on the outer layer for signaling a change in the volume of fluid in the chamber, wherein the passive indicator is configured to increase in size as the outer layer expands and decrease in size as the outer layer contracts; an image capture device; and a processing system, wherein the image capture device is configured to capture an image of the pump, and wherein the processing system is configured to process the image to signal the condition of the infusion assembly to a user of the system.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising a display for providing the condition of the infusion assembly to the user.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the processing system is configured to display a guide on the display to assist the user in utilizing the image capture device to capture the image.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein a single device comprises the image capture device and the processing system.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the single device is a smartphone.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the passive indicator comprises an ink printed on the outer layer.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the passive indicator is a symbol.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein a first indicator is provided on the bladder and the passive indicator provided on the outer layer is a second indicator, and wherein the first indicator and the second indicator are configured to align to signal a change in the volume of fluid in the chamber.
9. The pump system of claim 8, wherein the passive indicator is a symbol.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the bladder has a cylindrical shape in the deflated position and a spherical shape in the inflated position.
11. A method for communicating a condition on an elastomeric pump for an infusion assembly, the method comprising: providing the pump including: an expandable bladder defining a chamber for receipt of a volume of fluid, the bladder configured to expand from a deflated position to an inflated position as the chamber receives fluid and contract as the chamber dispenses fluid, an expandable outer layer surrounding the bladder, the outer layer configured to expand as the chamber receives fluid and to contract as the chamber dispenses fluid, and a passive indicator provided on the outer layer for signaling a change in the volume of fluid in the chamber, wherein the passive indicator is configured to increase in size as the outer layer expands and decrease in size as the outer layer contracts; capturing an image of the pump using an image capture device; processing the image using an image processing system to signal the condition of the pump to a user; and displaying information to the user of the pump to communicate the condition of the pump to the user.
12. The method of claim 11 wherein capturing the image comprises capturing an image of the indicator on the outer layer of the pump.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein processing the image comprises comparing the image to a stored image.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein the condition is a change in volume of the pump.
15. The method of claim 11, wherein a single device comprises the image capture device that captures the image, the image processing system that processes the image, and further wherein the single device displays the information to the user.
16. The method of claim 11, wherein capturing the image comprises aligning the pump guides displayed on a display of the image capture device.
