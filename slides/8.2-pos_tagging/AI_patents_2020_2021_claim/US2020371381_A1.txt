COLORED CONTACT LENS, MANUFACTURING METHOD OF COLORED CONTACT LENS, AND IRIS RECOGNITION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Provided is a colored contact lens having: a lens; and a colored region formed in the lens, at least a part of the colored region is arranged at a position overlapping an iris of a wearer when the colored contact lens is worn, and the colored region has infrared transparency.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A colored contact lens comprising: a lens; and a colored region formed in the lens, wherein at least a part of the colored region is arranged at a position overlapping an iris of a wearer when the colored contact lens is worn, and wherein the colored region has infrared transparency.
2. The colored contact lens according to claim 1, wherein at least a part of a pattern of the iris is unable to be determined by a visible light but is able to be determined by an infrared ray when the colored contact lens is worn.
3. The colored contact lens according to claim 1, wherein the colored region has transparency to a light whose wavelength is longer than 750 nm.
4. The colored contact lens according to claim 1, wherein the colored region has transparency to a light whose wavelength is longer than 750 nm and shorter than 1000 nm.
5. The colored contact lens according to claim 1, wherein the colored region has absorbability or reflectivity to a light whose wavelength is longer than or equal to 400 nm and shorter than or equal to 750 nm.
6. The colored contact lens according to claim 1, wherein a transmittance of the colored region to a light whose wavelength is longer than 750 nm and shorter than 1000 nm is larger than a transmittance of the colored region to a light whose wavelength is longer than or equal to 400 nm and shorter than or equal to 750 nm.
7. The colored contact lens according to claim 1, wherein the colored region is arranged at a position that covers an outer circumference of the iris when the colored contact lens is worn.
8. The colored contact lens according to claim 7, wherein the colored region is arranged at a position that does not cover a pupil of the wearer when the colored contact lens is worn.
9. The colored contact lens according to claim 1, wherein the colored region is formed of a coloring material having infrared transparency, and wherein the coloring material is not contained in a surface of the lens but contained inside the lens.
10. An iris recognition system comprising an infrared image acquisition unit that captures an iris of a recognition subject wearing the colored contact lens according to claim 1 by using infrared ray of a wavelength that transmits the colored region.
11. An iris recognition system comprising: an infrared image acquisition unit that captures an iris of a recognition subject wearing a colored contact lens having a colored region by using an infrared ray having a wavelength that transmits the colored region; a visible light image acquisition unit that captures the iris by using a visible light; a determination unit that determines whether or not the recognition subject is wearing the colored contact lens; and a comparison unit that performs comparison on the iris, wherein when the determination unit determines that the recognition subject is wearing the colored contact lens, the recognition unit performs comparison by using an image acquired by an infrared ray, and wherein when the determination unit determines that the recognition subject is not wearing the colored contact lens, the recognition unit performs comparison by using an image acquired by a visible light or an infrared ray.
12. A manufacturing method of a colored contact lens, the manufacturing method comprising: forming a lens; and forming a colored region in the lens, wherein at least a part of the colored region is arranged at a position overlapping an iris of a wearer when the colored contact lens is worn, and wherein the colored region has infrared transparency.
13. The manufacturing method of the colored contact lens according to claim 12, wherein the colored region is formed of a coloring material having infrared transparency, and wherein the coloring material is not contained in a surface of the lens but contained inside the lens.
14. The colored contact lens according to claim 1, wherein the colored region does not cover a pupil of the wearer when the colored contact lens is worn.
