USER INTERFACES TO CONFIGURE A THERMAL IMAGING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A thermal imaging system including at least one thermal imaging device, a server, and at least one mobile device. The thermal imaging device captures thermal images of an environment. The server applies computer vision techniques to the thermal images, detects events of a predetermined type, and generates notifications of the events of predetermined types detected from the thermal images. The mobile device runs a mobile application that is configured to receive the notifications, present user interfaces, receive user annotations of the notifications in the user interfaces, and transmit the annotations to the server. According to the annotations, the server adjusts parameters used in the application of the computer vision techniques and in the generation of the notifications.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: a server configured to: receive at least one thermal image of an environment, classify one or more objects in the thermal image using an image processor, transmit a notification based on the classifying, and adjust a setting of the image processor in response to user feedback associated with the notification; a thermal imaging device mounted in the environment configured to capture the thermal image; and a mobile device configured to: receive the notification, receive the user feedback regarding the notification via a user interface, and transmit the user feedback to the server.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the mobile device is configured to present a notification of a detected event in the environment and to receive user feedback on the notification.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the server is configured provide services based on the thermal image.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the thermal imaging device is configured to transmit the thermal image to the server.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the mobile device is configured to transmit the thermal image to the server.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the mobile device is configured to pre-process the thermal image prior to transmitting the thermal images to the server.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein classifying the one or more objects in the thermal image comprises identifying a human in the thermal image.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the server further classifies a pose of the human.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the server further infers an activity in the image based on the pose and a floor plan of the environment.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the server generates the floor plan based on one or more reference photographs captured by the mobile device.
11. The system of claim 1, the image processor comprising an artificial neural network.
12. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium for tangibly storing computer program instructions capable of being executed by a computer processor, the computer program instructions defining the steps of: receiving at least one thermal image of an environment; classifying one or more objects in the thermal image using an image processor; transmitting a notification to a mobile device based on the classifying; receiving user feedback on the thermal image from the mobile device; and adjusting a setting of the image processor in response to the user feedback associated with the notification;
13. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein classifying the one or more objects in the thermal image comprises identifying a human in the thermal image.
14. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein the classifying further comprises classifying a pose of the human.
15. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 14, wherein the steps further comprise inferring an activity in the image based on the pose and a floor plan of the environment.
16. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the steps further comprise generating the floor plan based on one or more reference photographs captured by the mobile device.
17. A method comprising: receiving, at a server, at least one thermal image of an environment; classifying, by the server, one or more objects in the thermal image using an image processor; transmitting, by the server, a notification to a mobile device based on the classifying; receiving, at the server, user feedback on the thermal image from the mobile device; and adjusting, by the server, a setting of the image processor in response to the user feedback associated with the notification;
18. The method of claim 17, wherein classifying the one or more objects in the thermal image comprises identifying a human in the thermal image.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the classifying further comprises classifying a pose of the human.
20. The method of claim 19, further comprising inferring an activity in the image based on the pose and a floor plan of the environment.
