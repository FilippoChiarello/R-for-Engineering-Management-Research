<title>
Graphical user interface for object discovery and mapping in open systems
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided for object discovery and object mapping through an application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Objects are discovered through an object recommendation channel and through user input of key words and/or key phrases. Each object includes an Intensity of Interest (IoI), which is a relative preference for an object reflected by relative size in the object map. Additionally, the object map provides a visual display which indicates relationships among objects.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for object discovery and mapping comprising: an application on a device with a processor and a display receiving a key word or key phrase through a graphical user interface (GUI) of the application; the application creating an object for addition to an object map of the GUI based on the key word or key phrase; the application positioning the object within the object map based on an Intensity of Interest (101) of the object, positions of other objects within the object map, and relationships between the object and the other objects within the object map; the application resizing and/or repositioning the object in the object map based on a frequency of use of the object and/or a recency of use of the object; the device constructing at least one signal based on raw data associated with the object and/or the object map, wherein the raw data includes the position of the object in the object map and/or the lol; the device sending the at least one signal to at least one object recommendation computer connected to the device over a network; the at least one object recommendation computer sending a recommended object to the device for display in an object recommendation channel of the application; the application adding the recommended object in the object recommendation channel; the application adding the recommended object to the object in the object map, wherein the object in the object map functions as a bin operable to include the recommended object; the application receiving a request to share the object with a second application on a second device, wherein the object is a bin which contains a secondary object; the application sharing the bin with the second application on the second device; the second application on the second device receiving a key word or a key phrase related to a tertiary object; the second application on the second device adding the tertiary object to the bin; and syncing the bin between the first application and the second application such that the bin in the first application and the bin in the second application include the secondary object and the tertiary object.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the recommended object includes a Uniform Resource Locator or a Universal Resource Locator (URL) which links to a web page related to the recommended object.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising creating a bin map for the bin, wherein the bin map displays the secondary object and the tertiary object based on lots of the secondary object and the tertiary object from the first application and the second application.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising completing a purchase through the application to create a purchased object, wherein upon purchase, a dialog box in the application recommends related objects to the purchased object for addition to the object map.
5. A method for object discovery and mapping comprising: an application on a device with a processor and a display receiving a key word or key phrase through a graphical user interface (GUI) of the application; the application creating an object for addition to an object map of the GUI based on the key word or key phrase; the application positioning the object within the object map based on an Intensity of Interest (lot) of the object, positions of other objects within the object map, and relationships between the object and the other objects within the object map; the application resizing and/or repositioning the object in the object map based on a frequency of use of the object and/or a recency of use of the object; the application displaying at least one recommended object in the object recommendation channel based on the lol of the object, the positions of other objects within the object map, and/or the relationships between the object and the other objects within the object map; the application adding the recommended object to the object in the object map, wherein the object in the object map functions as a bin operable to include the recommended object; the application receiving a request to share the object with a second application on a second device, wherein the object is a bin which contains at least one other object; the application sharing the object with the second application on the second device; the second application on the second device receiving a key word or a key phrase related to a second object; the second application on the second device adding the second object to the bin; and the second application on the second device syncing the bin with the first application such that the bin in the first application includes the at least one other object and the second object.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising constructing a signal based on the lol of the object, the positions of other objects within the object map, the relationships between the object and the other objects within the object map, and/or other raw data from the device, wherein the at least one recommended object is displayed in the object recommendation channel based on the signal.
7. The method of claim 5, further comprising activating a link to a web page associated with a Uniform Resource Locator or a Universal Resource Locator (URL) included in the recommended object, purchasing a good, product, or service associated with the recommended object through the web page, and automatically adding the recommended object to the object map based on the purchase of the recommended object through the web page.
8. A system for object discovery and mapping comprising: a device with a processor and a display in network communication with at least one object recommendation computer; wherein the device is operable to run an application with a graphical user interface (GUI) including an object map and an object recommendation channel; wherein the GUI is operable to add an object to an object map based on a key word or a key phrase; wherein the object includes an Intensity of Interest (IoI); wherein a position of the object in the object map is based on the lol and/or a relationship to another object in the object map; wherein the lol is based on a frequency of use of the object, a recency of use of the object, and/or a recency of addition of the object to the object map; wherein the object in the object map is resized and/or repositioned based on a frequency of use of the object and/or a recency of use of the object; wherein the device is operable to construct a signal based on raw data from the application, wherein the raw data includes the position of the object in the object map and/or the IoI; wherein the device is further operable to send the signal to the at least one object recommendation computer; wherein, upon receipt of the signal, the at least one object recommendation computer is operable to send a recommended object to the device; wherein the device is operable to display the recommended object in the object recommendation channel of the GUI; and wherein the recommended object includes a Uniform Resource Locator or a Universal Resource Locator (URL) which directs to a web page related to the recommended object; wherein the application is operable to add the recommended object to the object in the object map, wherein the object in the object map functions as a bin operable to include the recommended object; wherein the application is operable to receive a request to share the object with a second application on a second device, wherein the object is a bin which contains a secondary object; wherein the application is operable to share the bin with the second application on the second device; wherein the second application on the second device is operable to receive a key word or a key phrase related to a tertiary object; wherein the second application on the second device is operable to add the tertiary object to the bin; and syncing the bin between the first application and the second application such that the bin in the first application and the bin in the second application include the secondary object and the tertiary object.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the object is a bin which includes a secondary object, wherein the secondary object includes a Uniform Resource Locator or a Universal Resource Locator (URL) which directs to a web page relating to the secondary object.
10. The system of claim 8, further comprising a payment account portal, wherein the payment account portal is operable to link a payment account to the app and populate the object map and/or populate the object recommendation channel based on recent purchases with the payment account.
11. The system of claim 8, further comprising a hash table including the object and other objects in the object map, distances between the object and the other objects in the object map, and lots of the object and the other objects.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the application is operable to automatically add the recommended object to the object, wherein the object functions as a bin operable to include other objects, based on a projected lol for the recommended object exceeding a threshold for automatic addition to the object map, wherein the projected lol for the recommended object is calculated based on IoIs of the objects in the object map.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the object map includes Areas of Interest (AoIs), wherein the AoIs include sections of the object map in which the object or a group of objects are positioned, and wherein sizes of the AoIs and distances between and among AoIs are raw data used in constructing the at least one signal.
14. The system of claim 8, wherein the object includes a log file with records of interactions in the application with the object, and wherein the lol is based at least in part on the log file.
