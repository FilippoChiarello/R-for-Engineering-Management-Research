Hearing aid system
</title>

<abstract>
A hearing aid system includes an image capturing device capturing an image, microphones, an audio processing device connected with the image capturing device and the microphones, and an audio output device connected with the audio processing device. The audio processing device, by using classification models, performs analysis on the image to determine one of the classification models, controls the microphones to receive sound according to a plan which corresponds to the classification model, and operates in a mode corresponding to the plan to perform audio signal processing on collected audio signal(s) generated by the microphones so as to generate a processed audio signal, based on which the audio output device outputs sound.

<claims>
1. A hearing aid system adapted to be used by a user and capable of switching between modes of sound receiving for different scenes, comprising: an image capturing device configured to capture a field of view (FOV) image which is an image of surroundings seen by the user; a microphone assembly including a plurality of microphones spaced apart from each other, each of said microphones being individually controllable to receive sound to generate a collected audio signal; an audio processing device communicably connected with said image capturing device and said microphones, and including a scene analysis module that stores a plurality of scene classification models each of which is related to a specific scene, and that is configured to, by using the scene classification models, perform analysis on the FOV image captured by said image capturing device so as to determine one of the scene classification models with the specific scene that matches the FOV image, a microphone controller that stores a plurality of sound-receiving plans which respectively correspond to the scene classification models, and that is configured to control a preset number of said microphones to receive sound according to a target one of the sound-receiving plans which corresponds to the one of the scene classification models determined by said scene analysis module, and an audio signal processor that is switchable between a plurality of audio processing modes which respectively correspond to the sound-receiving plans, and is configured to operate in one of the audio processing mode corresponding to the target one of the sound-receiving plans to perform audio signal processing on the collected audio signal(s) generated by the preset number of said microphones so as to generate a processed audio signal; and an audio output device communicably connected with said audio processing device, and configured to output sound for the user based on the processed audio signal.
2. The hearing aid system as claimed in claim 1, further comprising: a display device communicably connected with said audio processing device; wherein said scene analysis module is further configured to perform the analysis on the FOV image by using the scene classification models based on features of the FOV image so as to determine, for each of the scene classification models, a degree of matching between the FOV image and the specific scene, and to output to said display device a comparison result that indicates a subset of the scene classification models, in which the degree of matching between the specific scene of each of the scene classification models and the FOV image is greater than a predetermined threshold, so as to enable said display device to display options of the subset of the scene classification models for selection by the user of a target classification model among the subset of the scene classification models; and wherein said microphone controller is configured to control the preset number of said microphones to collect sound according to the target one of the sound-receiving plans which corresponds to the target classification model.
3. The hearing aid system as claimed in claim 2, wherein said scene analysis module is operable to switch between a manual mode where said scene analysis module controls said display device to display options of all the scene classification models for selection by the user of one of the scene classification models to serve as the target classification model, and an automatic mode where said scene analysis module determines the degree of matching for each of the scene classification models, and outputs the comparison result to control said display device to display the options of the subset of the scene classification models, in which the degree of matching between the specific scene of each of the scene classification models and the FOV image is greater than the predetermined threshold, for selection by the user.
4. The hearing aid system as claimed in claim 2, further comprising a carrier that is to be mounted on the user, wherein said image capturing device and said microphones of said microphone assembly are mounted on said carrier.
5. The hearing aid system as claimed in claim 4, wherein: said carrier is a pair of glasses that have a lens to be positioned in front of the eyes of the user; and said display device is mounted on said carrier, and is configured to project the options of the subset of the scene classification models on said lens of said carrier based on techniques of micro-projection for selection by the user.
6. The hearing aid system as claimed in claim 4, wherein: said carrier is a pair of glasses; and said display device is a see-through display mounted on said carrier, and is to be positioned in front of the eyes of the user.
7. The hearing aid system as claimed in claim 2, wherein: said display device includes a touch screen, and a display controller that is operable in a scene mode, and is configured to, when said display controller is in the scene mode, control said touch screen to display the options of the subset of the scene classification models, and to transmit to said audio processing device a scene designation signal which indicates the target classification model being selected; and said microphone controller is configured to utilize the target one of the sound-receiving plans based on the scene designation signal to control the preset number of said microphones.
8. The hearing aid system as claimed in claim 7, wherein: said audio processing device further includes a directional controller; said display controller is switchable between the scene mode and a directional mode, and is further configured to, when said display controller is in the directional mode, control said touch screen to display the FOV image captured by said image capturing device in real time, to generate a direction designation signal which indicates a position of a selected area in the FOV image based on the user input of selecting the selected area, and to output the direction designation signal to said audio processing device; said directional controller is configured to control, in response to receipt of the direction designation signal, a predefined number of said microphones at predefined position(s) to receive sound for generating the collected audio signal(s); and said audio signal processor is configured to perform a filtering process on the collected audio signal(s) by using beamforming techniques so as to generate a processed audio signal which corresponds to sound coming from a direction that is related to the position of the selected area in the FOV image.
9. The hearing aid system as claimed in claim 1, wherein: said audio processing device further includes an activation controller that activates one of said microphones to receive sound to generate the collected audio signal, and that activates said audio signal processor to analyze the collected audio signal so as to determine whether the collected audio signal contains speech information; and when it is determined that the collected audio signal contains speech information, said activation controller activates said image capturing device and said scene analysis module.
