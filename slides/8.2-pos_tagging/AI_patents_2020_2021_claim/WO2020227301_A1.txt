CLEANING APPARATUS INCLUDING A ROTATING SPRAY HEAD ASSEMBLY ROTATION SENSOR
</title>

<abstract>
A containment tank assembly is described that includes a tank including an inner surface and a cleaning apparatus mounted to the tank. The cleaning apparatus includes an elongate arm and a rotary spray head assembly rotationally coupled to an end of the elongate arm. A rotating nozzle assembly is rotationally coupled to the rotary spray head. A magnetic field source is coupled to the rotary spray head so as to generate a spatially changing magnetic field in accordance with a rotation of the rotary spray head assembly in relation to the end of the elongate arm. A magnet field sensor is carried in a fixed relation to the elongate arm. The magnetic field sensor, in operation, generates a sensor signal that varies in accordance with the spatially changing magnetic field in accordance with the rotation of the rotary spray head assembly.

<claims>
1. An apparatus comprising:
an elongate arm;
a rotary spray head assembly rotationally coupled to an end of the elongate arm, and wherein a rotating nozzle assembly is rotationally coupled to the rotary spray head;
a magnetic field source coupled to the rotary spray head so as to generate a spatially changing magnetic field in accordance with a rotation of the rotary spray head assembly in relation to the end of the elongate arm; and
a magnet field sensor carried in a fixed relation to the elongate arm, wherein the magnetic field sensor, in operation, generates a sensor signal that varies in accordance with the spatially changing magnetic field in accordance with the rotation of the rotary spray head assembly.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising an electronic processor communicatively coupled to a communication interface that facilitates the electronic processor receiving the sensor signal generated by the magnetic field sensor in accordance with the spatially changing magnetic field.
3. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the spatially changing magnetic field is a
periodically repeating magnetic field having a period corresponding to a rotation period of the rotary spray head assembly.
4. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the magnetic field sensor is a Hall Effect sensor.
5. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein rotation of the rotary spray head assembly is affected by fluid pressure.
6. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein rotation of the rotary spray head assembly is affected by a mechanical shaft output of a motor.
7. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the magnetic field source is mounted on an outside surface of a body of the rotary spray head assembly.
8. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the magnetic field source is embedded within an outside surface of a body of the rotary spray head assembly.
9. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the magnetic field source comprises at least a first magnetic field source carried by the rotary spray head assembly.
10. The apparatus of claim 9 wherein the magnetic field source comprises at least a second magnetic field source carried by the rotary spray head assembly.
11. A containment tank assembly comprising:
a tank including an inner surface; and
a cleaning apparatus mounted to the tank, wherein the cleaning apparatus comprises: an elongate arm;
a rotary spray head assembly rotationally coupled to an end of the elongate arm, and wherein a rotating nozzle assembly is rotationally coupled to the rotary spray head; a magnetic field source coupled to the rotary spray head so as to generate a spatially changing magnetic field in accordance with a rotation of the rotary spray head assembly in relation to the end of the elongate arm; and
a magnet field sensor carried in a fixed relation to the elongate arm, wherein the magnetic field sensor, in operation, generates a sensor signal that varies in accordance with the spatially changing magnetic field in accordance with the rotation of the rotary spray head assembly.
12. The containment tank of claim 11 further comprising an electronic processor communicatively coupled to a communication interface that facilitates the electronic processor receiving the sensor signal generated by the magnetic field sensor in accordance with the spatially changing magnetic field.
13. The containment tank of claim 11 wherein the spatially changing magnetic field is a periodically repeating magnetic field having a period corresponding to a rotation period of the rotary spray head assembly.
14. The containment tank of claim 11 wherein the magnetic field sensor is a Hall Effect sensor.
15. The containment tank of claim 11 wherein rotation of the rotary spray head assembly is affected by fluid pressure.
16. The containment tank of claim 11 wherein rotation of the rotary spray head assembly is affected by a mechanical shaft output of a motor.
17. The containment tank of claim 11 wherein the magnetic field source is mounted on an outside surface of a body of the rotary spray head assembly.
18. The containment tank of claim 11 wherein the magnetic field source is embedded within an outside surface of a body of the rotary spray head assembly.
19. The containment tank of claim 11 wherein the magnetic field source comprises at least a first magnetic field source carried by the rotary spray head assembly.
20. The containment tank of claim 19 wherein the magnetic field source comprises at least a second magnetic field source carried by the rotary spray head assembly.
