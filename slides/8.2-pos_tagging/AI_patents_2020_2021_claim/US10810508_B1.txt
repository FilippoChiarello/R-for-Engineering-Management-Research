</title>

<abstract>
Methods and apparatus are provided for classifying and discovering historical and future operational states. An exemplary method comprises obtaining historical Boolean sensor data from sensors for a given time; generating a plurality of signatures over time comprised of the historical Boolean sensor data from the sensors for a corresponding given time; determining a plurality of time intervals having a corresponding interval signature, wherein each time interval is comprised of consecutive time units having a substantially same signature; assigning a predefined state to each time interval based on the interval signatures using a clustering method; obtaining, for each time interval, historical numerical sensor data from the sensors corresponding to measurements of the sensors during the associated time interval; and training a model using the historical numerical sensor data as an input, and the predefined state assigned to each time interval as a target output, to obtain coefficients of the machine learning model.
