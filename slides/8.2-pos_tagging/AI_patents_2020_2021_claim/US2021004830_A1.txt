<title>
SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AGENT ASSIST ERROR CORRECTION AND DETECTION WITHIN A CLOUD-BASED CONTACT CENTER
</title>

<abstract>
Methods to reduce agent effort and improve customer experience quality through artificial intelligence. The Agent Assist tool provides contact centers with an innovative tool designed to reduce agent effort, improve quality and reduce costs by minimizing search and data entry tasks The Agent Assist tool is natively built and fully unified within the agent interface while keeping all data internally protected from third-party sharing.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: receiving a communication from a customer; routing the communication to an agent; creating a transcript of the communication; analyzing to detect predetermined groupings of words or variations of the groupings of words; and alerting a supervisor upon detecting the predetermined groupings of the words or the variations of the groupings of the words.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising performing the analyzing to determine agent compliance.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining an emotional state of the agent.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining if the agent is talking too fast, too slow or if there is a delay between words.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving the communication as speech; converting the speech to text; and determining intent from the text.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the communication is a multi-channel communication and received as one of an SMS text, voice call, e-mail, chat, interactive voice response (IVR)/intelligent virtual agent (IVA) systems, and social media.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the analyzing is performed in real time during the communication.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: populating a notes interface with a transcript of the communication; and providing the transcript of the indication to the supervisor.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising highlighting the predetermined groupings of the words or the variations of the groupings of the words.
10. The method of claim 1, comprising performing analytics on the transcript.
11. A cloud-based software platform comprising: one or more computer processors; and one or more computer-readable mediums storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more computer processors, cause the cloud-based software platform to perform operations comprising: receiving a communication from a customer; routing the communication to an agent; creating a transcript of the communication; analyzing to detect predetermined groupings of words or variations of the groupings of words; and alerting a supervisor upon detecting the predetermined groupings of the words or the variations of the groupings of the words.
12. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising performing the analyzing to determine agent compliance.
13. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising determining an emotional state of the agent.
14. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising determining if the agent is talking too fast, too slow or if there is a delay between words.
15. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising: receiving the communication as speech; converting the speech to text; and determining intent from the text.
16. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, wherein the communication is a multi-channel communication and received as one of an SMS text, voice call, e-mail, chat, interactive voice response (IVR)/intelligent virtual agent (IVA) systems, and social media.
17. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, wherein the analyzing is performed in real time during the communication.
18. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising: populating a notes interface with a transcript of the communication; and providing the transcript of the indication to the supervisor.
19. The cloud-based software platform of claim 18, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising highlighting the predetermined groupings of the words or the variations of the groupings of the words.
20. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising analytics on the transcript.
