<title>
Speech production and the management/prediction of hearing loss
</title>

<abstract>
A method, including obtaining hearing data and speech data for a statistically significant number of individuals, and analyzing the obtained hearing data and speech data using a neural network to develop a predictive algorithm for hearing loss based on the results of the analysis, wherein the predictive algorithm predicts hearing loss based on input indicative of speech of a hearing impaired person who is not one of the individuals.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: obtaining hearing data and speech data for a statistically significant number of individuals; and analyzing with a processor the obtained hearing data and speech data using machine learning to develop a predictive algorithm for hearing loss, wherein the predictive algorithm predicts hearing loss based on input indicative of speech of a hearing impaired person who is not an individual of the statistically significant number of individuals.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein: the predictive algorithm is not focused on a specific speech feature.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein: analyzing with the processor the obtained hearing data and speech data using machine learning to develop a predictive algorithm for hearing loss results in a developed predictive algorithm for hearing loss; and wherein analyzing the obtained hearing data machine-trains a system that results in the developed predictive algorithm for hearing loss.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein: the obtaining hearing data and speech data results in obtained hearing data and speech data; and of the obtained hearing data and speech data, a first portion thereof is used, in a neural network, for training and a second portion thereof is used, in the neural network, for verification.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein: the machine learning develops the predictive algorithm by internally identifying features from the obtained hearing data and speech data.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein: the predictive algorithm utilizes a complex arrangement number of features present in the obtained speech data to predict hearing loss.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein: the method further comprises: obtaining biographical data for individuals of the statistically significant number of individuals, wherein obtaining biographical data for the individuals of the statistically significant number of individuals results in obtained biographical data; and analyzing with the processor the obtained hearing data and speech data and the obtained biographical data using a neural network to develop the predictive algorithm for hearing loss, wherein the predictive algorithm predicts hearing loss based on input indicative of speech and biographical data of a hearing impaired person who is not an individual of the statistically significant number of individuals.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein: the predictive algorithm is a trained system trained based on the statistically significant number of individuals.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein: the predictive algorithm utilizes non-heuristic processing to predict the hearing loss.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising: developing a prescription and/or a fitting regime for a hearing prosthesis to be used by a user using the predictive algorithm.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising: utilizing a code written in language of a neural network to develop the prescription and/or fitting regime.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein: the prescription is developed based on relationships as opposed to correlations between speech and hearing loss.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein: the predictive algorithm is agnostic to speech features.
14. The method of claim 10, further comprising obtaining the input indicative of speech of a hearing impaired person who is not one of the individuals of the statistically significant number of individuals, wherein developing the prescription and/or the fitting regime is executed directly from the input indicative of speech of a hearing impaired person who is not one of the individuals of the statistically significant number of individuals.
15. The method of claim 10, further comprising: obtaining non-speech and non-hearing related data and developing the prescription and/or fitting regime based on the non-speech and non-hearing related data.
16. The method of claim 1, further comprising: obtaining the input indicative of speech of the hearing impaired person who is not one of the individuals of the statistically significant number of individuals, wherein the input indicative of speech of a hearing impaired person who is not one of the individuals of the statistically significant number of individuals was developed without identified speech feature correlation to the hearing loss of the hearing impaired person who is not one of the individuals of the statistically significant number of individuals.
17. The method of claim 1, wherein: the predictive algorithm is a trained neural network.
18. The method of claim 1, further comprising: obtaining biographical data of the hearing impaired person who is not one of the individuals of the statistically significant number of individuals, wherein a result is that there is obtained biographical data; obtaining speech data of the hearing impaired person; and analyzing with the processor the speech data of the hearing impaired person and the obtained biographical data using the predictive algorithm to develop data regarding hearing loss of the hearing impaired person.
