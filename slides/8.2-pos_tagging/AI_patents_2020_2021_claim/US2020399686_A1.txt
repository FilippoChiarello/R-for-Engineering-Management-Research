METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SIMULTANEOUS TARGETED SEQUENCING OF DNA, RNA AND PROTEIN
</title>

<abstract>
Provided herein are methods and systems for the simultaneous targeted detection and sequencing of DNA, RNA, and Protein. In typical embodiments, the DNA, RNA, and Proteins are detected, characterized, and sequenced using just a single mammalian cell. One embodiment of detecting and characterizing DNA, RNA, or protein from a mammalian cell includes encapsulating a single cell in a drop and performing a protease digest on the encapsulated cell drop, performing a reverse transcriptase reaction; performing a droplet merger with barcoding PCR reagents and barcoding beads; performing a PCR reaction to attach the cell barcodes to the DNA targeted amplicons, RNA targeted amplicons, and protein tag amplicons, where all amplicons from the same emulsion contain the same cell barcode; and detecting and characterizing a DNA, RNA, or protein amplicon by sequencing the cell barcode incorporated into each amplicon.

<claims>
1. A multiomic detection and characterization method for detecting DNA, RNA, or protein from a cell, comprising encapsulating a cell in a drop comprising a reaction mixture comprising a protease; performing a protease digest on the encapsulated cell drop with the protease to produce a cell lysate; providing a reverse transcriptase and performing a reverse transcription reaction; performing a droplet merger with barcoding PCR reagents and barcoding beads; performing a PCR reaction to attach the cell barcodes to the DNA targeted amplicons, RNA targeted amplicons, and protein tag amplicons, wherein all amplicons from the same emulsion contain the same cell barcode; and detecting and characterizing a DNA, RNA, or protein amplicon by sequencing the cell barcode incorporated into each amplicon.
2. A method according to claim 1, wherein DNA, RNA, and proteins are detected and characterized
3. A method according to claim 1, wherein DNA, RNA, and proteins are detected and characterized from a single cell.
4. A method according to claim 1, wherein the reverse transcription reaction is performed in the same drop as the protease digest.
5. A method according to claim 1, further comprising performing a capture of DNA and RNA amplicons to a solid phase, wherein protein tag amplicons are separated from DNA and RNA amplicons.
6. A method according to claim 1, wherein a droplet merger with the cell lysate and reverse transcription is performed before the PCR reaction is performed.
7. A method according to claim 1, wherein the protease and reverse transcriptase reactions are performed on a PCR thermocycler and later transferred to another instrument for processing and analysis.
8. A method according to claim 4, wherein the instrument for processing and analysis comprises a Mission Bio, Tapestriâ„¢ system and the droplet merger with barcoding PCR reagents and barcoding beads is performed on this instrument.
9. A method according to claim 1, further comprising performing a nucleic acid concentration step.
10. A method according to claim 1, further comprising making a protein library.
11. A method according to claim 1, further comprising making a DNA library.
12. A method according to claim 1, further comprising making a RNA library.
13. A method according to claim 1, further comprising making a DNA, protein, and RNA library.
14. A method according to claim 1, wherein a reverse transcription reaction to produce a reverse transcription product is performed before a nucleic acid amplification step.
15. A method according to claim 1, wherein in the step, of performing a capture of DNA and RNA amplicons to a solid phase, the solid phase is a bead.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein one or more DNA, RNA, and protein listed in FIG. 9 is detected and characterized.
17. The method of claim 1, wherein two or more DNA, RNA, and protein listed in FIG. 9 are detected and characterized.
18. The method of claim 1, wherein three or more DNA, RNA, and protein listed in FIG. 9 are detected and characterized.
19. The method of claim 1, wherein four or more DNA, RNA, and protein listed in FIG. 9 are detected and characterized.
20. The method of claim 1, wherein five or more DNA, RNA, and protein listed in FIG. 9 are detected and characterized.
