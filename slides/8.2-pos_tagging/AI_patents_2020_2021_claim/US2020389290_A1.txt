<title>
BLU-RAY COPY SERVICE
</title>

<abstract>
An example operation may include one or more of receiving, by a validation node, a copy request from a user node over a blockchain network, the request contains a copy token, invoking, by the validation node, a smart contract associated with the copy token to verify the copy token, in response to a verification, generating, by the validation node, media copy keys for generation of a Blu-ray copy, and recording, by the validation node, the copy token on a ledger of the blockchain network to indicate that the copy token is spent.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system, comprising: a processor of a validation node; a memory on which are stored machine readable instructions that when executed by the processor, cause the processor to: receive a copy request from a user node over a blockchain network, the request contains a copy token; invoke a smart contract associated with the copy token to verify the copy token; in response to a verification, generate media copy keys for generation of a Blu-ray copy; and record the copy token on a ledger of the blockchain network to indicate that the copy token is spent.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to output format metadata to generate a format-specific Blu-ray copy.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to encrypt the media copy keys with a public key of a format-specific copy machine associated with the user node.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to verify that the copy token belongs to the user node.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to invoke the smart contract upon a detection of an attempt to spend the copy token by the user node.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to issue a challenge to the user node to be signed by a private key of the user node to verify the copy token.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to record a transaction on the ledger of the blockchain network to indicate that a Blu-ray copy associated with the copy request is made.
8. A method, comprising: receiving, by a validation node, a copy request from a user node over a blockchain network, the request contains a copy token; invoking, by the validation node, a smart contract associated with the copy token to verify the copy token; in response to a verification, generating, by the validation node, media copy keys for generation of a Blu-ray copy; and recording, by the validation node, the copy token on a ledger of the blockchain network to indicate that the copy token is spent.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising outputting format metadata to generate a format-specific Blu-ray copy.
10. The method of claim 8, further comprising encrypting the media copy keys with a public key of a format-specific copy machine associated with the user node.
11. The method of claim 8, further comprising verifying that the copy token belongs to the user node.
12. The method of claim 8, further comprising invoking the smart contract upon a detection of an attempt to spend the copy token by the user node.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising issuing a challenge to the user node to be signed by a private key of the user node to verify the copy token.
14. The method of claim 8, further comprising record a transaction on the ledger of the blockchain network to indicate that a Blu-ray copy associated with the copy request is made.
15. A non-transitory computer readable medium comprising instructions, that when read by a processor, cause the processor to perform: receiving a copy request from a user node over a blockchain network, the request contains a copy token; invoking a smart contract associated with the copy token to verify the copy token; in response to a verification, generating media copy keys for generation of a Blu-ray copy; and recording the copy token on a ledger of the blockchain network to indicate that the copy token is spent.
16. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, further comprising instructions, that when read by the processor, cause the processor to output format metadata to generate a format-specific Blu-ray copy.
17. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, further comprising instructions, that when read by the processor, cause the processor to encrypt the media copy keys with a public key of a format-specific copy machine associated with the user node.
18. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, further comprising instructions, that when read by the processor, cause the processor to verify that the copy token belongs to the user node.
19. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, further comprising instructions, that when read by the processor, cause the processor to invoke the smart contract upon a detection of an attempt to spend the copy token by the user node.
20. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, further comprising instructions, that when read by the processor, cause the processor to issue a challenge to the user node to be signed by a private key of the user node to verify the copy token.
