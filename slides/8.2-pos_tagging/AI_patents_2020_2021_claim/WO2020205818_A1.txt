REAL TIME PRODUCTIVITY EVALUATION OF LATERAL WELLS FOR CONSTRUCTION DECISIONS
</title>

<abstract>
In an aspect, a method incudes receiving data characterizing measurements recorded while drilling a wellbore can be received. The method can also include determining, using the measurements and a reservoir map, a storage capacity of the wellbore and a flow capacity of the wellbore. The method can further include determining a well construction plan using the storage capacity and the flow capacity. The method can also include providing the well construction plan. Related systems, techniques, and non-transitory computer readable mediums are also described.
