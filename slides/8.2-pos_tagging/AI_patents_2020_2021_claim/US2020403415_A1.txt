<claims>
1. A monitoring device configured to monitor an energy storage device, the monitoring device comprising: an acquisition unit configured to acquire information regarding whether a learning model is in a first mode or in a second mode, the learning model configured to detect a state of the energy storage device; and a change unit configured to change an operation of a balancer circuit from a predetermined state in a case where the learning model is in the first mode, the balancer circuit configured to balance a voltage of the energy storage device.
2. The monitoring device according to claim 1, wherein in the case where the learning model is in the first mode, the change unit changes a threshold voltage to a larger value, the threshold voltage configured to cause the balancer circuit to balance the voltage.
3. The monitoring device according to claim 1, wherein in the case where the learning model is in the first mode, the change unit changes the operation of the balancer circuit to a stopped state.
4. The monitoring device according to claim 1, wherein in the case where the learning model is in the first mode, the change unit causes one of a plurality of energy storage cells to discharge in order to increase a voltage difference between the plurality of energy storage cells.
5. The monitoring device according to claim 1, wherein in a case where the learning model is in the second mode, the change unit causes the balancer circuit to operate in the predetermined state.
6. The monitoring device according to claim 1, wherein in the case where the learning model is in the second mode, the change unit changes the operation of the balancer circuit from the predetermined state.
7. The monitoring device according to claim 1, wherein the acquisition unit acquires from a server the information regarding whether the learning model is in the first mode or in the second mode.
8. A monitoring method configured to monitor an energy storage device, the monitoring method comprising: acquiring information regarding whether a learning model is in a first mode or in a second mode, the learning model configured to detect a state of the energy storage device; and changing an operation of a balancer circuit from a predetermined state in a case where the learning model is in the first mode, the balancer circuit configured to balance a voltage of the energy storage device.
9. A computer program configured to cause a computer to cause a learning model regarding an energy storage device to learn, wherein the computer executes the steps of: acquiring information regarding whether the learning model is in a first mode or in a second mode; changing an operation of a balancer circuit from a predetermined state in a case where the learning model is in the first mode, the balancer circuit configured to balance a voltage of the energy storage device; and acquiring input data, including at least one of a voltage, a current, a temperature, and a state of charge (SOC) of the energy storage device, to provide the input data to the learning model.
