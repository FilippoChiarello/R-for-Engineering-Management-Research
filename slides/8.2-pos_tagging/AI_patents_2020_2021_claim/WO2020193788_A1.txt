DETERMINING HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY RISK FOLLOWING RADIOTHERAPY
</title>

<abstract>
Described is a computer-implemented method for determining a risk of hematologic toxicity in a subject to be treated with radiotherapy. The method involves processing treatment data including a prescribed dose of radiation for the subject and imaging data displaying radiation- sensitive tissues such as bone marrow and/or lymphoid organs in the subject to determine a received dose of radiation to be delivered to the radiation-sensitive tissues. The method further comprises processing patient data such as blood cell counts and the received dose of radiation to obtain a risk of hematologic toxicity in the subject in response to the radiotherapy. Also provided is a system and computer program product for performing the method.

<claims>
1. A computerimplemented method (200) for determining a risk of hematologic toxicity in a subject to be treated with radiotherapy, the method comprising:
receiving patient data (202) associated with the subject, wherein the patient data includes blood cell counts in the subject;
receiving treatment data (204), wherein the treatment data includes a prescribed dose of radiation to be administered to the subject;
receiving imaging data (206), wherein the imaging data comprises an image including one or more radiationsensitive tissues in the subject, the radiationsensitive tissues comprising regions of hematopoeisis and/or leukocyte maturation, activation, and/or proliferation in the subject; wherein the radiationsensitive tissue comprises bone marrow and/or lymphoid organs;
processing the treatment data and the imaging data (208) to determine a received dose of radiation to be delivered to the radiationsensitive tissues in the subject;
processing the patient data and the received dose of radiation (210) to obtain a risk of hematologic toxicity in the subject in response to the radiotherapy.
2. A method according to claim 1, wherein the hematologic toxicity comprises lymphopenia and the patient data includes lymphocyte numbers in the subject's blood.
3. A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the patient data further comprises age, gender and/or disease characteristics in the subject.
4. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the treatment data further comprises a distribution of radiation doses to be administered to treated areas within the subject.
5. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the imaging data is derived from computerized tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 6. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the imaging data is indicative of proliferative and/or metabolic activity in the radiationsensitive tissues of the subject.
7. A method according to claim 6, wherein the imaging data is derived from PET imaging using a 18F-fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) tracer.
8. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the radiationsensitive tissue comprises bone marrow.
9. A method according to claim 8, wherein the radiationsensitive tissue comprises bone marrow of the thoracic vertebrae.
10. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the radiationsensitive tissue includes lymphoid organs, such as thymus, lymph nodes, spleen and/or mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue.
11. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the radiotherapy comprises fractionated radiotherapy, the treatment data includes a plurality of fraction doses, and the imaging data comprises a plurality of images, wherein each image is obtained at administration of a different radiotherapy fraction.
12. A method according to claim 11, wherein if the imaging data does not comprise an image obtained at administration of a specific radiotherapy fraction n, the method further comprises predicting imaging data corresponding to radiotherapy fraction n from the plurality of images obtained at administration of different radiotherapy fractions.
13. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the received dose of radiation to be delivered to radiationsensitive tissues in the image is outputted to a display.
14. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein if the risk of hematologic toxicity is determined to be above a predetermined threshold, the method further comprises receiving updated patient data including blood cell counts from the subject obtaining after initiation of the radiotherapy treatment, and obtaining an updated risk of hematologic toxicity in the subject based on the updated patient data, treatment data and imaging data.
15. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the subject is to be treated with combined radiotherapy and immunotherapy for cancer.
16. A system (100) for determining a risk of hematologic toxicity in a subject to be treated with radiotherapy, the system comprising:
an interface (110) for receiving:
(i) patient data (112) associated with the subject, wherein the patient data includes blood cell counts in the subject;
(ii) treatment data (114), wherein the treatment data includes a prescribed dose of radiation to be administered to the subject;
(iii) imaging data (116), wherein the imaging data comprises a graphical representation including one or more radiationsensitive tissues in the subject, the radiationsensitive tissues comprising regions of hematopoeisis and/or leukocyte maturation, activation, and/or proliferation in the subject; wherein the radiationsensitive tissue comprises bone marrow and/or lymphoid organs;
a memory (106); and
a processor (104) configured to execute instructions stored on the memory to:
(a) process the treatment data and the imaging data to determine a received dose of radiation to be delivered to the radiationsensitive tissues in the subject; and
(b) process the patient data and the received dose of radiation to obtain a risk of hematologic toxicity in the subject in response to the radiotherapy.
17. A computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable medium, the computer readable medium having computer readable code embodied therein, the computer readable code being configured such that, on execution by a suitable computer or processor, the computer or processor is caused to perform the method of any of claims 1 to 15.
