FIXED-POINT QUANTIZATION IN NEURAL NETWORKS FOR VEHICLE PERCEPTION SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
Examples of techniques for using fixed-point quantization in deep neural networks are disclosed. In one example implementation according to aspects of the present disclosure, a computer-implemented method includes capturing a plurality of images at a camera associated with a vehicle and storing image data associated with the plurality of images to a memory. The method further includes dispatching vehicle perception tasks to a plurality of processing elements of an accelerator in communication with the memory. The method further includes performing, by at least one of the plurality of processing elements, the vehicle perception tasks for the vehicle perception using a neural network, wherein performing the vehicle perception tasks comprises quantizing a fixed-point value based on an activation input and a synapse weight. The method further includes controlling the vehicle based at least in part on a result of performing the vehicle perception tasks.
