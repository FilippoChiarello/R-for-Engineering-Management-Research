PRESENTING PRODUCTS TO USERS BASED ON PERSONALIZED PRODUCT PRICING DETERMINED FROM USER CHARACTERISTICS
</title>

<abstract>
A merchant system offers various products for sale to users, with prices for different products received from a pricing server. The merchant system provides information identifying a user to a pricing server, which determines user-specific prices for the products offered by the merchant system. Prior purchases of products by various users via the merchant system and user-specific information maintained by the pricing server for the user corresponding to the user identifying information are used to generate the user-specific prices. The pricing server selects the user-specific price for a product as a candidate price having a maximum expected profit to the merchant system. Subsequently, the pricing server transmits to the merchant system a listing of products offered by the merchant system and their user-specific prices ordered by their expected profit to the merchant system. The merchant system displays the products to the user in the order received from the pricing server.

<claims>
1. A method comprising:
receiving, at a pricing server, information from a merchant system identifying products offered for purchase by a merchant system;
determining, by the pricing server, a general price for each product for which the merchant system received information from the pricing server, the general price for a product determined by the pricing server applying a trained model to a cost of the merchant system to obtain the product;
receiving, at the pricing server, information from the merchant system describing prior purchases of products by users via the merchant system and describing prior accesses of the merchant system by users;
receiving a request for user-specific prices at the pricing server from the merchant system including information identifying a specific user that the merchant system received from a client device and identifying the merchant system; obtaining, by the pricing server, information describing prior purchases of
products by users via the merchant system;
retrieving, by the pricing server, characteristics of the specific user from the
information identifying the specific user;
generating, by the pricing server, user-specific prices for each of a set of the
products offered for purchase by the merchant system by applying one or more trained machine learning models to the characteristics of the specific user and information describing prior purchases of the products of the set by other users of the merchant system, a user-specific price for a product of the set based on a likelihood of the specific user purchasing the product of the set when offered at the user-specific price;
generating, by the pricing server, an order of the products of the set based on the user-specific prices for each product of the set; and
transmitting the determined order of the set of products and the user-specific prices for each product of the set to the merchant system for display to the specific user.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the user-specific price for a product of the set corresponds to a price of the product of the set having a maximum expected profit to the merchant system, the expected profit of the product of the set comprising a product of a likelihood of the specific user purchasing the product of the set and a difference between the price of the product of the set and a cost of the merchant system to obtain the product of the set.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein generating, by the pricing server, the order of the products of the set based on the user-specific prices for each product of the set comprises:
for each product of the set of products, determining a difference between an
expected profit to the merchant system for offering the product of the set at the user-specific price for the product of the set and a profit to the merchant system for offering the product of the set at a general price determined for the product of the set; and
ordering the products of the set so products of the set having a greater difference between the expected profit to the merchant system for offering the product of the set at the user-specific price for the product of the set and the profit to the merchant system for offering the product of the set at the general price determined for the product of the set have higher positions in the order.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the information describing prior purchases of products by users identifies products offered by the merchant system during different times and prices at which one or more products were previously purchased from the merchant system.

determining likelihoods of the product of the set being purchased by the specific user when offered at each of a plurality of prices from a ratio of a number of times the product of the set was purchased when offered at a price to a number of times users accessed the merchant system when the product was offered at the price, when the product was available for purchase via the merchant system, and when the specific user accessed a description of the product of the set via the merchant system.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein selecting the user-specific price for the product of the set from the distribution comprises:
determining an expected amount of profit to the merchant system for multiple prices of the product of the set for each of multiple prices of the plurality of prices, the expected amount of profit to the merchant system for a price comprising a product of a likelihood of the specific user purchasing the product of the set when offered at the price and a difference between the price and a cost of the merchant system to obtain the product of the set; and
selecting the user-specific price for the product as the price having a maximum expected amount of profit to the merchant system.
