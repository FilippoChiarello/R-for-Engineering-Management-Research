<title>
Virtual Reality for Situational Handling
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods, and computer programmable products are described herein for situational handling using a virtual reality application. A procurement system receives an order including one or more goods and a situation. A cloud platform receives sensor data of a package containing the one or more goods. A scanner scans the package and a storage location of the package. The procurement system provides the storage location to an virtual reality (VR) application for display and a notification of the situation once it occurs.

<claims>
1. A method implemented by one or more data processors forming part of at least one computing device, the method comprising: receiving, by a procurement system, an order comprising one or more goods and a situation; receiving, by a cloud platform, sensor data of a package containing the one or more goods; scanning, by a scanner, the package and a storage location of the package; and providing, by the procurement system, the storage location to an virtual reality (VR) application for display and a notification of the situation once it occurs.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: displaying, on a display of an electronic device, a virtual view of the package in its storage location based on an image captured by a camera of the electronic device; and displaying, on top of the virtual view, a visualization of directional features to identify how to locate the package.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising providing, via the VR application, one or more remedies for the situation based on the notification, the one or more remedies comprising generating a communication to a supplier of the one or more goods or generating a re-order of the one or more goods.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the VR application displays at least one of a user's view of the storage location or a top down perspective view of the storage location.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the sensor data comprises at least one of temperature data, global positioning system (GPS) data, or accelerometer data.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the situation occurs when a temperature of the package exceeds a temperature threshold or when the package experiences an acceleration that exceeds an acceleration threshold.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising correlating the sensor data with the situation identification.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the correlating is performed by either the cloud platform or the procurement system.
9. A system comprising: at least one data processor; and memory storing instructions, which when executed by at least one data processor, result in operations comprising: receiving, by a procurement system, an order comprising one or more goods and a situation; receiving, by a cloud platform, sensor data of a package containing the one or more goods; scanning, by a scanner, the package and a storage location of the package; and providing, by the procurement system, the storage location to an virtual reality (VR) application for display and a notification of the situation once it occurs.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the operations further comprise: displaying, on a display of an electronic device, a virtual view of the package in its storage location based on an image captured by a camera of the electronic device; and displaying, on top of the virtual view, a visualization of directional features to identify how to locate the package.
11. The system of claim 9, wherein the operations further comprise providing, via the VR application, one or more remedies for the situation based on the notification, the one or more remedies comprising generating a communication to a supplier of the one or more goods or generating a re-order of the one or more goods.
12. The system of claim 9, wherein the VR application displays at least one of a user's view of the storage location or a top down perspective view of the storage location.
13. The system of claim 9, wherein the sensor data comprises at least one of temperature data, global positioning system (GPS) data, or accelerometer data.
14. The system of claim 9, wherein the situation occurs when a temperature of the package exceeds a temperature threshold or when the package experiences an acceleration that exceeds an acceleration threshold.
15. The system of claim 9, wherein the operations further comprise correlating the sensor data with the situation identification.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the correlating is performed by either the cloud platform or the procurement system.
17. A non-transitory computer program product storing instructions which, when executed by at least one data processor forming part of at least one computing device, implement operations comprising: receiving, by a procurement system, an order comprising one or more goods and a situation; receiving, by a cloud platform, sensor data of a package containing the one or more goods; scanning, by a scanner, the package and a storage location of the package; and providing, by the procurement system, the storage location to an virtual reality (VR) application for display and a notification of the situation once it occurs.
18. The non-transitory computer program product of claim 17, wherein the operations further comprise: displaying, on a display of an electronic device, a virtual view of the package in its storage location based on an image captured by a camera of the electronic device; and displaying, on top of the virtual view, a visualization of directional features to identify how to locate the package.
19. The non-transitory computer program product of claim 17, wherein the operations further comprise providing, via the VR application, one or more remedies for the situation based on the notification, the one or more remedies comprising generating a communication to a supplier of the one or more goods or generating a re-order of the one or more goods.
20. The non-transitory computer program product of claim 17, wherein the operations further comprise correlating the sensor data with the situation identification.
