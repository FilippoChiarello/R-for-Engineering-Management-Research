<title>
High sensitivity fiber optic based detection
</title>

<abstract>
A detection system for measuring the presence of one or more conditions in a predetermined area includes a fiber harness having at least one fiber optic cable for transmitting light. The at least one fiber optic cable defines a node arranged to measure the one or more conditions. The node is arranged such that light scattered by an atmosphere adjacent the node is received by at least one core of the fiber optic cable. A control system operably connected to the fiber harness includes a light source for transmitting light to the node and a light sensitive device configured to receive scattered light associated with the node. The control system analyzes more than one signal corresponding to more than one wavelength of the scattered light associated with the node to determine at least one of a presence and magnitude of the one or more conditions at the node.
