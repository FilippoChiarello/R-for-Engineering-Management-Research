INFORMATION PROCESSING DEVICE, INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD, AND COMPUTER-READABLE RECORDING MEDIUM RECORDING INFORMATION PROCESSING PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
A falling asleep prediction device includes a biological data acquisition unit that acquires biological information on a subject, a falling asleep prediction unit that predicts that the subject falls asleep after predetermined time by using the biological information, and a notification processing unit that notifies that the subject falls asleep after the predetermined time.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An information processing device comprising: an acquisition unit configured to acquire biological information on a subject; a prediction unit configured to predict that the subject falls asleep after predetermined time by using the biological information; and a notification unit configured to notify that the subject falls asleep after the predetermined time.
2. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the acquisition unit acquires the biological information from a sensor that measures the biological information from the subject in a non-contact manner.
3. The information processing device according to claim 2, wherein the sensor is a radio Doppler sensor.
4. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the biological information includes body movement data indicating body movement of the subject, breathing data indicating breathing of the subject, and heartbeat data indicating heartbeat of the subject.
5. The information processing device according to claim 1, further comprising a storage unit configured to store a falling asleep prediction model constructed by machine learning using the biological information as an input value and a predicted value indicating probability that the subject falls asleep after the predetermined time as an output value, wherein the prediction unit determines whether the predicted value obtained by inputting the biological information into the falling asleep prediction model is larger than a threshold, and when it is determined that the predicted value is larger than the threshold, the prediction unit determines that the subject falls asleep after the predetermined time.
6. The information processing device according to claim 5, further comprising a threshold adjustment unit configured to adjust the threshold based on past falling asleep time tendency distribution of the subject.
7. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the notification unit determines whether variation magnitude of past falling asleep time of the subject is equal to or less than a predetermined value, and when it is determined that the variation magnitude is equal to or less than the predetermined value, the notification unit notifies that the subject falls asleep after the predetermined time.
8. The information processing device according to claim 7, wherein the subject is a person to be assisted who receives predetermined assistance immediately before falling asleep, and when it is determined that the variation magnitude is larger than the predetermined value, the notification unit transmits confirmation information for confirming with the subject whether to receive the predetermined assistance.
9. An information processing method comprising, by a computer: acquiring biological information on a subject; predicting that the subject falls asleep after predetermined time by using the biological information; and notifying that the subject falls asleep after the predetermined time.
10. A computer-readable recording medium recording an information processing program that causes a computer to function as: an acquisition unit configured to acquire biological information on a subject; a prediction unit configured to predict that the subject falls asleep after predetermined time by using the biological information; and a notification unit configured to notify that the subject falls asleep after the predetermined time.
