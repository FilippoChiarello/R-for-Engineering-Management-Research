METHODS FOR DETECTING SYSTEM-LEVEL TROJANS AND AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DEVICE WITH SYSTEM-LEVEL TROJAN DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of a method, an IC device, and a circuit board are disclosed. In an embodiment, the method involves at an IC device of the system, monitoring activity on a bus interface of the IC device, wherein the bus interface is connected to a bus on the system that communicatively couples the IC device to at least one other IC device on the system, applying machine learning to data corresponding to the monitored activity to generate an activity profile, monitoring subsequent activity on the bus interface of the IC device, comparing data corresponding to the subsequently monitored activity to the machine learning generated activity profile to determine if a system-level Trojan is detected, and generating a notification when it is determined from the comparison that a system-level Trojan has been detected.

<claims>
1. A method for detecting a system-level Trojan on a system that includes multiple integrated circuit (IC) devices, the method comprising: - at an IC device of the system, monitoring activity on a bus interface of the IC device, wherein the bus interface is connected to a bus on the system that communicatively couples the IC device to at least one other IC device on the system; - at the IC device of the system, applying machine learning to data corresponding to the monitored activity to generate an activity profile; - at the IC device of the system, monitoring subsequent activity on the bus interface of the IC device; - at the IC device of the system, comparing data corresponding to the subsequently monitored activity to the machine learning generated activity profile to determine if a system-level Trojan is detected; and - at the IC device of the system, generating a notification when it is determined from the comparison that a system-level Trojan has been detected.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein monitoring activity and monitoring subsequent activity on the bus interface of the IC device involves monitoring activity on a JTAG interface of the IC device.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein monitoring activity and monitoring subsequent activity on the bus interface of the IC device involves monitoring timing behavior of signals at the bus interface.
4. The method of any preceding claim, wherein monitoring activity and monitoring subsequent activity on the bus interface of the IC device involves measuring propagation delay of signals from the IC device to another IC device through a bus on a printed circuit board, wherein the propagation delay measurement is based on a boundary scan.
5. The method of any preceding claim, wherein monitoring activity and monitoring subsequent activity on the bus interface of the IC device involves port scanning on a logical port.
6. The method of any preceding claim, wherein monitoring activity and monitoring subsequent activity on the bus interface of the IC device involves port scanning on a physical port.
7. The method of any preceding claim, further comprising applying statistical analysis to the data corresponding to the monitored activity and to the data corresponding to the subsequently monitored activity.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the statistical analysis involves statistical analysis related to at least one of latency, size, and workload of data packets.
9. The method of claim 7 or 8, wherein the statistical analysis involves generating histograms related to at least one of a time interval between two memory accesses, a difference in addresses of memories that are accessed, and a difference in data that is read or written.
10. The method of any preceding claim, wherein applying machine learning involves implementing a netlist-based simulation.
11. The method of any preceding claim, wherein applying machine learning involves implementing feature extraction on the data corresponding to the monitored activity and on the data corresponding to the subsequently monitored activity.
12. The method of any preceding claim, wherein monitoring activity on the bus interface of the IC device involves monitoring activity on the bus interface of the IC device before the IC device has been deployed for its intended use and after the IC device has been deployed for its intended use, and applying machine learning to data corresponding to the monitored activity to generate an activity profile involves applying machine learning to data generated from the pre-deployment activity monitoring and applying machine learning to data generated from the post-deployment activity monitoring.
13. The method of any preceding claim, wherein determining if a system-level Trojan has been detected involves applying a detection threshold to an output of the comparison.
14. An integrated circuit (IC) device comprising: - a bus interface; - a processor and memory that stores computer readable instructions, which when executed by the processor and memory circuit, implements; monitoring activity on the bus interface of the IC device, wherein the bus interface is connectable to a bus on a system that communicatively couples the IC device to at least one other IC device on the system; applying machine learning to data corresponding to the monitored activity to generate an activity profile; monitoring subsequent activity on the bus interface of the IC device; comparing data corresponding to the subsequently monitored activity to the machine learning generated activity profile to determine if a system-level Trojan is detected; and generating a notification when it is determined from the comparison that a system-level Trojan has been detected.
15. A circuit board comprising the IC device of claim 14.
