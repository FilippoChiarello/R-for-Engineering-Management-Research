EXTRACTING ENTITY RELATIONS FROM SEMI-STRUCTURED INFORMATION
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems for processing records include extracting feature vectors from words in an unstructured portion of a record. The feature vectors are weighted based similarity to a topic vector from a structured portion of the record associated with the unstructured portion. The weighted feature vectors are classified using a machine learning model to determine respective probability vectors that assign a probability to each of a set of possible relations for each feature vector. Relations between entities are determined within the record based on the probability vectors. An action is performed responsive to the determined relations.
