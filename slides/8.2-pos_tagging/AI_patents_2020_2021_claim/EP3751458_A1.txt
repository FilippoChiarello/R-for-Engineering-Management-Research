METHOD FOR THERMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS USING A HYBRID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
A thermographic analysis method is proposed, comprising the following steps: acquiring thermal infrared (TIR) image data of a structure; acquiring visible light image data of the structure; processing the TIR image data through a first part of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to obtain a first intermediate result; processing the visible light image data through a second part of the CNN to obtain a second intermediate result, the second part comprising a plurality of convolutional layers; concatenating the first intermediate result and the second intermediate result to obtain a concatenated intermediate result and processing it to obtain thermographic analysis data including coordinates of identified segments of the input images associated with possible thermal leaks as well as an associated probability score for each identified segment; and providing the thermographic analysis data to a user. A method of training a convolutional neural network for thermographic analysis is also proposed.
