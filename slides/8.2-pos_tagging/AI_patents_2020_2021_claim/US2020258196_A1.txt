IMAGE PROCESSING APPARATUS, IMAGE PROCESSING METHOD, AND STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
An image processing apparatus 106 obtains a captured image captured by an image capturing device 102 in an input image obtaining unit 501. A foreground background separating unit 503 obtains a foreground input image 302 by separating a foreground area including a specific object from the obtained captured image. By inputting the foreground input image 302 to a resolution enhancing unit 506, a foreground output image 306 having a higher resolution as compared to the foreground input image 302 is outputted from the resolution enhancing unit 506. The foreground output image 306 is used to generate a virtual viewpoint image.

<claims>
1. An image processing apparatus comprising: an obtaining unit configured to obtain a first input image including a first area representing a specific object in a captured image obtained by capturing by an image capturing device; and an outputting unit configured to output a first output image having a higher resolution as compared to the first input image by inputting the first input image obtained by the obtaining unit, the first output image being used to generate a virtual viewpoint image.
2. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the obtaining unit further obtains a second input image including a second area different from the first area in the captured image, and wherein the outputting unit outputs a second output image having a higher resolution as compared to the second input image by inputting the second input image obtained by the obtaining unit, the second output image being used to generate a virtual viewpoint image.
3. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the outputting unit outputs the first output image and the captured image to a generating unit configured to generate a virtual viewpoint image.
4. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the outputting unit outputs, from the first input image, the first output image based on a learning result using a first teacher image including an area including a specific object and a first image having a lower resolution as compared to the first teacher image, the first image being an image corresponding to the first teacher image.
5. The image processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the outputting unit outputs, from the second input image, the second output image based on a learning result using a second teacher image including an area different from an area including a specific object and a second image having a lower resolution as compared to the second teacher image, the second image being an image corresponding to the second teacher image.
6. The image processing apparatus according to claim 2, further comprising an integrating unit configured to integrate the first output image and the second output image outputted by the outputting unit.
7. The image processing apparatus according to claim 6, further comprising a correcting unit configured to correct a value of a pixel in a boundary part between the first area and the second area in an integrated image integrated by the integrating unit.
8. The image processing apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the correcting unit corrects, among values of pixels in the boundary part, a pixel value having a difference equal to or greater than a threshold from a value of a surrounding pixel.
9. The image processing apparatus according to claim 8, wherein the correcting unit corrects the pixel value having a difference equal to or greater than a threshold by using a value of a pixel adjacent the boundary part.
10. The image processing apparatus according to claim 8, wherein the correcting unit performs the correction by replacing the pixel value having a difference equal to or greater than a threshold with any one of a median, an average, and a most frequent value of a pixel adjacent the boundary part.
11. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the outputting unit includes a neural network.
12. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising a generating unit configured to generate three-dimensional shape data on an object based on the first output image.
13. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the first output image is used to determine a pixel value of a specific object in a virtual viewpoint image.
14. The image processing apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the generating unit determines a pixel value of a specific object in a virtual viewpoint image by using the first output image.
15. An image processing method comprising the steps of: obtaining a first input image including a first area representing a specific object in a captured image obtained by capturing by an image capturing device; and outputting a first output image having a higher resolution as compared to the first input image by inputting the first input image obtained in the obtaining step, the first output image being used to generate a virtual viewpoint image.
16. A non-transitory computer readable storage medium storing a program which causes a computer to perform an image processing method, the method comprising the steps of: obtaining a first input image including a first area representing a specific object in a captured image obtained by capturing by an image capturing device; and outputting a first output image having a higher resolution as compared to the first input image by inputting the first input image obtained in the obtaining step, the first output image being used to generate a virtual viewpoint image.
