Engine governor
</title>

<abstract>
An electronic governor system includes a motor, a transmission coupled to the motor, a throttle plate coupled to the transmission, the throttle plate movable to multiple positions between closed and wide-open, wherein power is supplied to the motor to move the throttle pate to a desired position and wherein power is not supplied to the motor to maintain the throttle plate in the desired position.

<claims>
1. An electronic governor system, comprising: a motor; a transmission coupled to the motor; a throttle plate coupled to the transmission, the throttle plate movable to a plurality of positions between closed and wide-open; an engine speed sensor; and a controller including a feedback control module and an adaptive control module; wherein the feedback control module is configured to: determine an engine speed error based on a comparison of a current engine speed input signal from the engine speed sensor and a desired engine speed; and provide an engine speed output signal to the motor to control the position of the throttle plate to correct the engine speed error, wherein the engine speed output signal is determined by a control algorithm using the engine speed error as an input; wherein the adaptive control module is configured to: determine an expected engine speed error correction based on the engine speed output signal provided by the feedback control module; determine an actual engine speed error correction based on a current engine speed input signal from the engine speed sensor and a previous engine speed input signal from the engine speed sensor; determine a correction error based on the expected engine speed error correction and the actual engine speed correction; and adjust a parameter of the control algorithm of the feedback control module when the correction error is within a predetermined range or outside of a predetermined range.
2. The electronic governor system of claim 1, wherein the feedback control module utilizes a proportional-integral-derivative control algorithm to provide the engine speed output signal and the parameter adjusted by the adaptive control module is at least one of a proportional parameter, an integral parameter, and a derivative parameter.
3. The electronic governor system of claim 2, wherein the proportional-integral-derivative control algorithm utilizes a plurality of parameter sets, each parameter set including a proportional parameter, an integral parameter, and a derivative parameter, and wherein the feedback control module is configured to utilize a specific parameter set based on the position of the throttle plate.
4. The electronic governor system of claim 3, wherein a first parameter set is utilized by the proportional-integral-derivative control algorithm when the throttle plate is near the closed position and a second parameter set is utilized by the proportional-integral-derivative control algorithm when the throttle plate is near the wide-open position.
5. The electronic governor system of claim 3, further comprising a temperature sensor configured to detect a temperature, wherein a first parameter set is utilized by the proportional-integral-derivative control algorithm when the detected temperature is below a threshold and a second parameter set is utilized by the proportional-integral-derivative control algorithm when the detected temperature is above the threshold.
6. The electronic governor system of claim 2, further comprising a temperature sensor configured to detect a temperature, wherein the detected temperature is an input to the fuzzy logic control algorithm.
7. The electronic governor system of claim 1, wherein the feedback control module utilizes a fuzzy logic control algorithm to provide the engine speed output signal and wherein the parameter adjusted by the adaptive control module is at least one parameter of at least one rule of the fuzzy logic control algorithm.
8. The electronic governor system of claim 1, further comprising an ignition system, wherein excess energy from the ignition system is used to power the motor.
9. The electronic governor system of claim 1, wherein power is not supplied to the motor when the throttle plate position is not changing.
10. The electronic governor system of claim 1, wherein the adaptive control module is configured to adjust a parameter of the feedback control module such that a subsequent engine speed output signal is more aggressive when the expected engine speed error correction is less than the actual engine speed correction.
11. The electronic governor system of claim 1, wherein the adaptive control module is configured to adjust a parameter of the feedback control module such that a subsequent engine speed output signal is less aggressive when the expected engine speed error correction is greater than the actual engine speed correction.
