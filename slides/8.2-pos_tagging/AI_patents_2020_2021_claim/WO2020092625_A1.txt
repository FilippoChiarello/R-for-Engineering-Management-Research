DATA LINK BETWEEN VOLATILE MEMORY AND NON-VOLATILE MEMORY
</title>

<abstract>
A computing system has a first processing device and memory regions used by the processing device during normal operation. In one approach, the computing system is configured to: collect data associated with operation of an autonomous vehicle; monitor, by a first processing device, the collected data; and based on the monitoring, determine that an event on the autonomous vehicle has occurred. The computing system is further configured to, in response to determining that the event has occurred, initiate a transfer of data controlled by a second processing device, the transfer including copying data stored in volatile memory of the autonomous vehicle to non-volatile memory of the autonomous vehicle, wherein the second processing device controls copying of the data independently of the first processing device.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method comprising:
collecting data associated with operation of an autonomous vehicle;
monitoring, by a first processing device, the collected data;
based on the monitoring, determining that an event on the autonomous
vehicle has occurred; and
in response to determining that the event has occurred:
initiating a transfer of data controlled by a second processing device, the transfer including copying data stored in volatile memory of the autonomous vehicle to non-volatile memory of the autonomous vehicle, wherein the second processing device controls copying of the data independently of the first processing device; and
reducing power to the first processing device.
2. The method of claim 1 , wherein the event is a loss of power or an impending loss of power from a power source of the autonomous vehicle.
3. The method of claim 1 , wherein the transfer of data is part of a hibernation process.
4. The method of claim 1 , wherein the collected data includes data from at least one accelerometer of the autonomous vehicle, and the event is a deceleration of the vehicle that exceeds a predetermined threshold.
5. The method of claim 1 , wherein the first processing device and the second processing device are powered by at least one first power source of the autonomous vehicle, and wherein reducing power to the first processing device comprises shutting down power provided from the at least one first power source to the first processing device.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising, in response to determining that the event has occurred, switching power to the second processing device so that the power is provided to the second processing device by a second power source instead of by the at least one first power source.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the event is a collision of the vehicle with another object.
8. The method of claim 1 , further comprising sending, by the second processing device, a signal to the first processing device, the signal indicating that copying of the data has been completed.
9. A system comprising:
volatile memory;
non-volatile memory;
at least one processing device; and
memory storing instructions configured to instruct the at least one processing device to:
collect data from at least one computing system;
monitor, by a first processing device, the collected data, wherein the first processing device is powered by a first power source; based on the monitoring, determine that an event associated with the at least one computing system has occurred; and
in response to determining that the event has occurred:
initiate a transfer of data controlled by a second processing device, the transfer including copying data stored in the volatile memory to the non-volatile memory, wherein the second processing device controls copying of the data independently of the first processing device;
after initiating the transfer of data, reduce or terminate power to the first processing device; and
switch a source of power for the second processing device to a second power source.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the collected data includes data indicating failure or impending failure of a power source that provides power to the volatile memory.
1 1. The system of claim 9, wherein the volatile memory comprises a plurality of memory regions, and wherein the instructions are further configured to instruct the at least one processing device to determine an ordering of the memory regions, wherein copying the data stored in the volatile memory comprises copying the memory regions to the non-volatile memory in the determined ordering.
12. The system of claim 1 1 , wherein the determined ordering is based on
monitoring the collected data.
13. The system of claim 9, wherein monitoring the collected data includes
providing the collected data as an input to a machine learning model.
14. The system of claim 9, wherein monitoring the collected data includes
determining a status of at least one power source that provides power to the first processing device or the volatile memory.
15. The system of claim 9, wherein monitoring the collected data includes
determining failure or impending failure of the first power source, and wherein the second power source is a backup power source.
16. The system of claim 9, wherein the transfer of data is part of a hibernation process.
17. The system of claim 9, wherein the second processing device is configured to send a signal to the first processing device, the signal indicating that copying the data is completed.
18. The system of claim 9, wherein the collected data includes data from at least one accelerometer.
19. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that, when executed by at least one processing device, cause the at least one processing device to perform a method, the method comprising:
collecting data from at least one computing system;
monitoring, by a first processing device, the collected data;
based on the monitoring, determining that an event has occurred; and in response to determining that the event has occurred, initiating a transfer of data controlled by a second processing device, the transfer including copying data stored in volatile memory to non-volatile memory.
20. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 19, wherein the first processing device and the second processing device are powered by at least one first power source, and wherein the method further comprises, in response to determining that the event has occurred, switching power to the second processing device so that the power is provided to the second processing device by a second power source instead of by the at least one first power source.
