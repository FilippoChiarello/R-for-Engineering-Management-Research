<title>
Biomarkers and methods of diagnosing and prognosing mild traumatic brain injuries
</title>

<abstract>
The invention provides biomarkers and methods for determining the risk of a subject for developing mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI). In some aspects, the methods of the invention also determine the fitness of a subject for participating in an activity with increased chances of receiving a head impact. Some embodiments of the invention are directed to kits for determining the risk of a subject for developing mTBI or the fitness of a subject for participating in an activity with increased chances of receiving a head impact.

<claims>
1. A method for determining the risk of a subject for developing mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) or the fitness of a subject for participating in an activity with increased chances of receiving a head impact, comprising: obtaining a biological sample from the subject after a head injury; obtaining a control biological sample, wherein the control biological sample is selected from the group consisting of: the baseline sample of the subject, a matched sample from a different subject that plays non-contact sports, and a predicted control sample calculated from the general population; measuring the biological sample with RNASeq for an amount of at least one extracellular RNA (exRNA) biomarker transcribed from a gene selected from the group consisting of ENSG00000163346, ENSG00000112941, ENSG00000087589, and ENSG00000160917; measuring the control biological sample with RNASeq for an amount of the at least one exRNA biomarker; and comparing the amount of the at least one exRNA biomarker in the biological sample with the amount of the at least one exRNA biomarker in the control biological sample, wherein a change in the amount of the at least one exRNA biomarker from the subject compared with the control biological sample is indicative of the subject having an increased risk for mTBI or being unfit for participating in the activity with increased chances of receiving a head impact; wherein decreased amounts of exRNA transcribed from the gene of ENSG00000112941 in a urine sample and/or ENSG00000087589 in a plasma sample and increased amounts of exRNA transcribed from the gene of ENSG00000160917 in a urine sample and/or ENSG00000163346 in a urine sample are indicative of the subject being at increased risk for mTBI or unfit for participating in the activity with increased chances of receiving a head impact.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the control biological sample is a matched sample from a different subject that plays non-contact sports.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the control biological sample is from the subject's baseline sample.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the biological sample from the subject is obtained within 48 hours after the subject received a head impact or is suspected of having a head impact.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein at least two exRNA biomarkers are measured and compared, wherein a change in the amount of the at least two exRNA biomarkers from the subject compared with the control is indicative of the subject having an increased risk for mTBI or being unfit for participating in the activity with increased chances of receiving a head impact.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one exRNA biomarker comprises exRNA transcribed from the gene of ENSG00000163346.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the biological sample from the subject is obtained within 24 hours after the subject received a head impact or is suspected of having a head impact.
