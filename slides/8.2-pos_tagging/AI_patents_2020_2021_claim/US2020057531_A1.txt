<title>
FLEXIBLE TOUCH SENSING SYSTEM AND METHOD WITH DEFORMABLE MATERIAL
</title>

<abstract>
A single volume soft sensor capable of sensing real-time continuous contact and stretching. An electrical impedance tomography (EIT) technique with support vector machine (SVM) learning is employed to estimate changes of resistance distribution on the sensor caused by fingertip contact even during sensor deformation events. A deformation switch is incorporated to maintain the localization during deformation events.

<claims>
1. A sensing system, comprising: a stretchable base material which changes its resistance distribution upon a mechanical deformation event; a plurality of electrodes attached to a perimeter of the base material; a capacitive sensing channel attached to the base material; and a control unit operatively connected to the plurality of electrodes and the capacitive sensing channel, the processing unit configured to utilize electrical impedance tomography with support vector machine learning to estimate changes of resistance distribution on the sensor caused by a human body contact to determine a reconstructed image of the location and shape of the human body contact, the processing unit further configured to evaluate when the mechanical deformation event is occurring and use a previously-stored reconstructed image of the location and shape of the human body contact during said mechanical deformation event.
2. The sensing system of claim 1, wherein the control unit is further configured to begin adaptively updating a baseline EIT measurement when the human body contact with the base material begins and stop updating the baseline EIT measurement when the human body contact with the base material ends.
3. The sensing system of claim 2, wherein said human body contact beginning and ending are sensed by the control unit via the capacitive sensing channel
4. The sensing system of claim 1, wherein the base material comprises a carbon filled elastomer.
5. The sensing system of claim 1, wherein the control unit utilizes a neighboring method to sense the location and shape of said human body contact, said neighboring method comprising: a) measuring a first voltage differential between a first adjacent pair of the electrodes; b) measuring a second voltage differential between a second adjacent pair of electrodes, the first and second pairs of electrodes having a common electrode; and c) continuing to measure voltage differentials between successive neighboring pairs of the electrodes until all adjacent pairs of the electrodes have been evaluated for their voltage differential.
6. The sensing system of claim 1, wherein the control unit is further configured to: a) measure a baseline measurement of said voltage differential values; and b) determine when the base material has been mechanically stretched based on differences in the voltage differential values.
7. The sensing system of claim 1, wherein the control unit is further configured to apply a color filter to the reconstructed image to localize a contact coordinate from the center of the image.
8. The sensing system of claim 1, wherein the base material is imprinted with graphics to indicate control buttons of a device user control interface.
9. The sensing system of claim 1, wherein the electrodes are evenly spaced along the perimeter of the base material.
10. The sensing system of claim 1, further comprising a current source connected between the control unit and the electrodes.
