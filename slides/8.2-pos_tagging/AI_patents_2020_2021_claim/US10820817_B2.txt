<title>
Monitoring the effects of sleep deprivation using neuronal avalanches
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention is directed to a method of continuously monitoring neuronal avalanches in a subject comprising (a) determining a deviation in avalanche exponent (α) or branching parameter (σ) from a predetermined value at rest, wherein the pre-determined value of α is a slope of a size distribution of the synchronized neuronal activity and the predetermined value is −3/2 and the pre-determined value of σ is a ratio of successively propagated synchronized neuronal activity and the predetermined value is 1; and (b) repeating step (a) one or more times to continuously monitor neuronal avalanches in a subject. The invention also features methods of determining or monitoring the degree of sleep deprivation in a subject, methods of identifying subjects that are susceptible to a sleep disorder and methods of diagnosing a sleep disorder in a subject.

<claims>
1. A method of determining the degree of sleep deprivation in a subject comprising: (a) performing an electrocephalogram (EEG) using sensors provided on the subject; (b) determining, by at least one processing device, an avalanche exponent α or a branching parameter σ from signals output by the sensors, wherein α is a slope of a size distribution of a synchronized neuronal activity and σ is a ratio of successively propagated synchronized neuronal activity; (c) determining, by the at least one processing device, a deviation in α or σ as determined from a pre-determined value of α or σ at rest, wherein: the pre-determined value of α is −3/2, and the pre-determined value of σ is 1; (d) repeating steps (a)-(c) one or more times; (e) determining, by the at least one processing devices, the degree of sleep deprivation in the subject, wherein a change in α or σ from the pre-determined value of alpha (α) or sigma (σ) indicates the degree of sleep deprivation in the subject; (f) providing, by the at least one processing devices, an alert when the degree of sleep deprivation determined the subject crosses a critical threshold that the subject is at risk of underperformance, and outputting a recommendation the subject undergo a period of recovery sleep; and (g) repeating steps (a) through (e) one or more times if the subject has undergone a period of recovery sleep to determine whether the period of recovery sleep has diminished the degree of sleep deprivation determined in the subject below the critical threshold.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject with the deviation in α or σ as determined from the pre-determined value of α or σ performs a psychomotor vigilance task.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining, by the at least one processing device, a magnitude and spatial distribution of theta power in the signals output by the sensors.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising gathering data from other physiological sensors.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the method is operational with hardware or software or a combination thereof.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein step (a) further comprises: (i) filtering the signals output from the sensors; (ii) the sensors include multiple EEG electrodes, and positive/negative threshold crossings at each EEG electrode are detected; (iii) clustering threshold crossings on the EEG electrodes on a pre-determined time scale; and (iv) calculating the cluster size distribution for determining α, or calculating a ratio of successive threshold crossings for determining σ.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the EEG is continuously recorded at more than one site.
8. The method of claim 6, wherein the EEG is filtered between 1-100 Hz.
9. The method of claim 6, wherein the time scale is 1-50 ms.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the deviation in α or σ as determined from the pre-determined value of α or σ indicates the presence of sleep deprivation in the subject when the change is outside of a tolerance range of 10% deviation from the pre-determined value of α or σ.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the sensors include multiple dry electrodes of a headset, wherein the dry electrodes are individually isolated and amplified, wherein the headset is wearable in a non-laboratory setting.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising: (h) identifying the time when α and σ are determined to deviate from their pre-determined values at rest.
