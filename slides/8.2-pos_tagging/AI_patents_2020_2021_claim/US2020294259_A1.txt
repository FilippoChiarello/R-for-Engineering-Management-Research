CONTOUR BASED IMAGE SEGMENTATION APPARATUS AND METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A Shape Based Modeling Segmentation fits generated Bézier curves on to edges parsed from an object in an image, identifies the Bézier curves in predefined proximity having at least one of a geometric relationship and a reporting relationship with other Bézier curves in the predefined proximity; generates MetaBézier curves from the identified Bézier curves; and connects the MetaBézier curves to identify the object in the image.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method comprising: fitting generated Bézier curves on to edges parsed from an object in an image, by a Shape Based Modeling Segmentation (SBMS) system; identifying, by the SBMS system, Bézier curves in a predefined proximity, the Bézier curves having at least one of a geometric relationship and a reporting relationship with other Bézier curves in the predefined proximity; generating, by the SBMS system, MetaBézier curves from identified Bézier curves; and connecting, by the SBMS system, the MetaBézier curves to identify the object in the image.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the generating comprises establishing a hierarchy between the Bézier curves in the predefined proximity and applying wraptangles to related Bézier curves.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising finding the Bézier curves within the wraptangles and establishing a hierarchical relationship based on a resolution threshold.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the generating comprises establishing a hierarchy between the Bézier curves at a threshold, wherein the threshold includes at least one of resolution threshold and a sensitivity threshold.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising obtaining the threshold by at least one of changing a trigger threshold for edge detection, down-sampling the image by pixel averaging applications, and down-sampling the image by more physical application.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the connecting comprises using directionality preference of the Bézier curves to link a set of boundaries Bézier curves into a closed path that would enclose the object.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the connecting comprises using Bézier curves appearing at any downsample and threshold level with at least one level of corroboration.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the connecting comprises executing a full-cycle boundary path goal-seeking process using search trees and the MetaBézier curves.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the fitting comprises converting pixels generated by an image sensor into Bézier curves.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising using to MetaBézier curves to identify a specific class of objects.
11. The method of claim 1, further comprising using MetaBézier curves to perform texture classification.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the connecting comprises filling in gaps of a partially occluded section of the object.
13. The method of claim 1, further comprising discovering congruency between Bézier curves that are generated at different points in time by moving the object.
14. The method of claim 1, further comprising creating BiBézier curves using pairs of related Bézier curves linked via wraptangles.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein the generating comprises representing a color space as at least one plane, applying a filter shape in the color space to the MetaBézier curves and relating MetaBézier curves to a color space.
16. The method of claim 15, further comprising representing one MetaBézier curve as a circle in the color space.
17. A Shape Based Modeling Segmentation (SBMS) system comprising: a Bézier curve system configured to fit generated Bézier curves on to edges parsed from an object in an image; and a MetaBézier platform configured to identify Bézier curves in a predefined proximity, the Bézier curves having at least one of a geometric relationship and a reporting relationship with other Bézier curves in the predefined proximity, generate MetaBézier curves from identified Bézier curves, and connect the MetaBézier curves to identify the object in the image.
18. The SBMS system of claim 17, further comprising: An automated labeling system configured to use the MetaBézier curves to identify specific classes of objects; and a texture classification system configured to perform robust texture classification.
19. A computing device, comprises: a memory configured to store non-transitory computer-executable instructions; a transceiver; a processor configured to perform a set of functions including: fit generated Bézier curves on to edges parsed from an object in an image; identify Bézier curves in a predefined proximity, the Bézier curves having at least one of a geometric relationship and a reporting relationship with other Bézier curves in the predefined proximity; generate MetaBézier curves from identified Bézier curves; and connect the MetaBézier curves to identify the object in the image.
