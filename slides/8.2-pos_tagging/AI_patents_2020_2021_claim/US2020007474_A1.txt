KNOWLEDGE-DRIVEN DIALOG SUPPORT CONVERSATION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and devices to perform knowledge-driven dynamic conversations and select content within automated agents such as chatbots and virtual assistants are disclosed. In an example, operations to facilitate a knowledge-based conversation session with a human user using an automated agent include: receiving a conversational input regarding a support issue; analyzing the conversational input to determine an intent and applicable entity properties associated with the intent; performing a multi-turn conversation to identify a solution using the intent and the applicable entity properties, by exchanging iterative questions and answers between the automated agent and the user to dynamically recalculate applicability of the solution to the support issue; and outputting information associated with the identified solution. In further examples, the operations include a dynamic application of a solution policy and a diagnosis policy in the multi-turn conversation, to determine whether to deliver a solution or ask diagnosis questions.

7. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the entity properties associated with the intent include characteristics of at least one product and at least one product feature, wherein the identified solution includes instructions specific to the at least one product and the at least one product feature.
8. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the multi-turn conversation is performed using information from a knowledge graph of a conversation model, wherein the knowledge graph specifies relationships among the intent, the entity properties, and the identified solution.
9. The computing device of claim 8, wherein the conversation model is adapted to conduct the conversation session to assist a technical support scenario with the human user, wherein the intent expressed in the conversation session relates to one or more support issues in the technical support scenario, and wherein the entity properties expressed in the conversation session specify characteristics of a product or service involved with the support issues.
10. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the conversation session is performed in a text chat bot session within a computing user interface.
11.
