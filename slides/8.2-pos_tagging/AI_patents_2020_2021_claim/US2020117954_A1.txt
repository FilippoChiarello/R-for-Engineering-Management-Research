<title>
Multi-Stage Image Recognition for a Non-Ideal Environment
</title>

<abstract>
Provided are an apparatus and a method of multi-stage image recognition. For the multi-stage image recognition, categorized object data is received from a first deep neural network. A second deep neural network is trained on subcategory customization data that relates to a non-ideal environment when the second deep neural network produces invalid subcategorized object data from the categorized object data, and generates an image recognition result using the second deep neural network as trained.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of multi-stage image recognition, the method comprising: receiving categorized object data from a first deep neural network; training a second deep neural network based on subcategory customization data that relates to a non-ideal environment when the second deep neural network produces invalid subcategorized object data from the categorized object data; and generating an image recognition result using the second deep neural network as trained.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein training the second deep neural network based on subcategory customization data comprises: receiving user subcategory input relating to categorized object data; receiving ambient environment data relating to non-ideal image data; and training a third deep neural network based on the user subcategory input and the ambient environment data to produce a plurality of subcategories.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the first deep neural network is trained on stock image data.
4. The method of claim 1 further comprising: subcategorizing, by the second deep neural network, the categorized object data with one of a plurality of subcategories to produce subcategorized object data; and providing the subcategorized object data to produce the image recognition result.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the categorized object data is based on non-ideal image data from at least one of: a digital camera; a handheld mobile device; a surveillance device; or an artificial intelligence device.
6. The method of claim 2, wherein the ambient environment data comprises at least one of: ambient lighting data; ambient humidity data; or time-of-day data.
7. A method of image recognition comprising: receiving non-ideal image data; detecting, by a first deep neural network, an object from the non-ideal image data to produce detected object data; categorizing, by a second deep neural network, the detected object data with one of a plurality of categories to produce categorized object data; and training a third deep neural network based on subcategory customization data relating to a personalized user environment when the third deep neural network produces invalid subcategorized object data from the categorized object data for generating an image recognition result.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein training the third deep neural network based on subcategory customization data comprises: receiving user subcategory input relating to the non-ideal image data; receiving ambient environment data relating to the non-ideal image data; and training the third deep neural network based on the user subcategory input and the ambient environment data to produce a plurality of subcategories.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the first and the second deep neural networks are trained on stock image data.
10. The method of claim 7 further comprising: subcategorizing, by the third deep neural network, the categorized object data with one of a plurality of subcategories to produce valid subcategorized object data; and providing the valid subcategorized object data to produce an image recognition result.
11. The method of claim 7, wherein the plurality of categories is a plurality of coarse-grained categories.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the plurality of subcategories is a plurality of fine-grained subcategories.
13. The method of claim 7, wherein the categorized object data is based on the non-ideal image data from at least one of: a digital camera; a handheld mobile device; a surveillance device; or an artificial intelligence device.
14. The method of claim 8, wherein the ambient environment data comprises at least one of: ambient lighting data; ambient humidity data; or time-of-day data.
15. Apparatus for multi-stage image recognition, the apparatus comprising: a processor; and memory coupled to the processor, the memory for storing instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to: receive categorized object data from a first deep neural network; and train a second deep neural network based on subcategory customization data relating to a personalized user environment when the second deep neural network produces invalid subcategorized object data from the categorized object data for generating an image recognition result.
16. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the memory stores further instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to train the second deep neural network based on subcategory customization data by: receiving user subcategory input relating to non-ideal image data; receiving ambient environment data relating to the non-ideal image data; and training a third deep neural network based on the user subcategory input and the ambient environment data to produce a plurality of subcategories.
17. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the first deep neural network is trained on stock image data.
18. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the memory stores further instructions that, when executed, cause the processor to: subcategorize, by the second deep neural network, the categorized object data with one of a plurality of subcategories to produce valid subcategorized object data; and provide the valid subcategorized object data to produce the image recognition result.
19. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the categorized object data is based on non-ideal image data from at least one of: a digital camera; a handheld mobile device; a surveillance device; or an artificial intelligence device.
20. The apparatus of claim 16, wherein the ambient environment data comprises at least one of: ambient lighting data; ambient humidity data; or time-of-day data.
