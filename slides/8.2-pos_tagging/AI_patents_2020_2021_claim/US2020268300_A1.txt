SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PREDICTING MOOD, EMOTION AND BEHAVIOR OF NON-RECUMBENT SUBJECTS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for predicting emotional state, behavioral state, or mood of a subject including a non-contacting physiologic sensing apparatus, as well as, possibly, an image capture sensor or a microphone, which may be incorporated into an article of furniture, for detecting parameters indicative of emotional state of a non-recumbent subject.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for predicting emotional state by monitoring a non-recumbent subject outside a medical institution, the method comprising: (a) placing a non-contacting physiologic sensor within operational distance of the subject; (b) gathering, using said non-contacting physiologic sensor, data pertaining to at least one parameter selected from the group consisting of heart rate, respiration and body-vibrations; (c) determining from the data at least one physiological parameter selected from the group: heart rate variability, respiration rate variability, Cardiac Output calculation, respiration volume and combinations thereof; and (d) inferring said emotional state of said subject.
2. The method according to claim 1, comprising: logging on a common timeline at least one of: data for each of said at least one parameter, and said non-physiologic data on said common timeline.
3. The method according to claim 1, further comprising using a data processor to calculate at least one of: a coefficient based on two or more of said parameters, and a rate of change for one or more of said parameters.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein said sensor is integrated into a seat.
5. The method according to claim 1, comprising placing one or more additional non-contacting physiologic sensors within operational distance of said healthy subject.
6. The method to claim 1, comprising activating said sensor only when said subject is within said operational distance.
7. An article of furniture for predicting emotional state of a subject, the article of furniture comprising comprising: (a) a seating platform; and (b) a non-contacting physiologic sensing apparatus operable to monitor a subject sitting in said seating platform and to gather data pertaining to at least one physiological parameter of said subject selected from a group consisting of: heart rate, respiration, body-vibrations, heart rate variability, respiration rate variability, cardiac output calculation, respiration volume and combinations thereof.
8. The article of furniture according to claim 7, wherein said at least one non-contacting physiologic sensing apparatus comprises at least one parameter sensor installed at a location selected from the group consisting of within said seating platform, below said seating platform, and on an edge of said seating platform.
9. The article of furniture according to claim 7, further comprising at least one additional feature selected from: a back support, an armrest, a seat belt, a head rest, a footrest and combinations thereof, and wherein said non-contacting physiologic sensing apparatus is incorporated into said additional feature.
10. The article of furniture according to claim 7, wherein said at least one non-contacting physiologic sensing apparatus comprises at least two parameter sensors installed at different locations on said furniture.
11. The article of furniture according to claim 7, wherein said at least one non-contacting physiologic sensing apparatus includes reversible attachment hardware.
12. The article of furniture according to claim 7, wherein said at least one non-contacting physiologic sensing apparatus further comprises an occupancy detector that activate a parameter sensor only when said seat is occupied.
13. The article of furniture of claim 7 for predicting emotional state of a subject, the article further comprising at least one of: an image capture sensor configured and operable to record visual indications of the subject; and a microphone configured and operable to record audio indications of the subject.
14. A system comprising: (a) the article of furniture of claim 7; (b) a first memory buffer receiving a time stamped output from a non-contacting physiologic sensor monitoring a subject exposed to time stamped content; (c) a second memory buffer containing said time stamped content; and (d) a temporal registration module registering said time stamped output on said time stamped content to produce a log file of physiologic responses to said content.
15. The system according to claim 14, wherein said a temporal registration module employs at least one clock selected from the group consisting of a clock embedded in said content, a clock associated with said sensor and a clock providing an output signal to both said sensor and a content presentation device.
16. The system according to claim 14, comprising a presentation module that presents said time stamped output from said non-contacting physiologic sensor concurrently with said content.
17. The system according to claim 14, wherein said presentation module presents said time stamped output from said non-contacting physiologic sensor graphically.
18. The system according to claim 14, wherein said presentation module presents said time stamped output from said non-contacting physiologic sensor numerically.
19. The system according to claim 14, comprising a data processor which calculates a coefficient based on two or more of said physiological parameters.
20. The system according to claim 14, comprising a data processor which calculates a rate of change for one or more of said physiological parameters.
