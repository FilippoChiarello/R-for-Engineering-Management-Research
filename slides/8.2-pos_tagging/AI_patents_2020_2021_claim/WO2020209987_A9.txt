HIGH-THROUGHPUT METHODS TO CHARACTERIZE PHAGE RECEPTORS AND RATIONAL FORMULATION OF PHAGE COCKTAILS
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention provides for a method for screening for gene function for a bacteriophage, the method comprising: (1) (a) providing one or more host organism, such as a species or strain, libraries, (b) providing randomly barcoded transposon sequencing (such as RB-TnSeq), and (c) screening for loss-of-function (LOF) mutant phenotypes; or (2) (a) providing one or more DNA barcoded overexpression strain libraries (such as Dub-seq) using DNA of the host organism and/or phage, and (b) screening for gain-of-function (GOF).
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for screening for gene function for a bacteriophage, the method comprising:
(1) (a) providing one or more host organism, such as a species or strain, libraries, (b) providing randomly barcoded transposon sequencing (such as RB-TnSeq), and (c) screening for loss-of-function (LOF) mutant phenotypes; or (2) (a) providing one or more DNA barcoded overexpression strain libraries (such as Dub-seq) using DNA of the host organism and/or phage, and (b) screening for gain-of-function (GOF).
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the method comprises: (a) providing one or more host organism, such as a species or strain, libraries, (b) providing randomly barcoded transposon sequencing (such as RB-TnSeq), and (c) screening for loss-of-function (LOF) mutant phenotypes.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the providing one or more host organism libraries comprises inserting a barcoded transposon into a host organism, such as using the method taught in Example 1, wherein the host organism(s) can be any host organism, such as any described in Table 1.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the method comprises: (a) providing one or more DNA barcoded overexpression strain libraries (such as Dub-seq) using DNA of the host organism and/or phage, and (b) screening for gain-of-function (GOF).
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the providing one or more DNA barcoded
overexpression strain libraries using DNA of the host organism and/or phage comprises cloning a partial or total host/phage genome DNA fragments into a library of barcoded vector, such as a vector that can stably reside in the host organism, wherein each resulting vector comprises a host/phage genone DNA fragment integrated into the vector, such as using the method taught in Example 1, wherein the host organism(s) can be any host organism, such as any described in Table 1.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the providing step comprises end repairing the
fragments, phosphoylating the repaired fragments, and ligating the phosphorylated repaired fragments to the vector.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the screening step comprises transforming a phage library into cloning bacterial strain, such as an E. coli strain, collecting the transformants, growing to saturation, and characterizing barcoded junctions derived from the phage library.
8. The method of claim 4, wherein the providing one or more DNA barcoded
overexpression strain libraries using DNA of the host organism and/or phage comprises shearing genomes of one or more bacteriophages inserting a barcoded transposon into a host organism, such as using the method taught in Example 1, wherein the bacteriophages(s) can be any bacteriophages(s) which correspond to a single host, such as any described in Table 1.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein there is one species of host organism and a plurality of bacteriophage species wherein each bacteriophage species is capable of infecting the host organism.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein there are a plurality of host organism species and one bacteriophage species wherein the bacteriophage species is capable of infecting each host organism species in the plurality of host organism species.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the providing and/or screening steps are automated and/or high throughout. In some embodiments, each individual host organism and/or phage sample is provided and/or screened in a format configured for automated and/or high throughout processing and/or handling, such as a 96-well format.
