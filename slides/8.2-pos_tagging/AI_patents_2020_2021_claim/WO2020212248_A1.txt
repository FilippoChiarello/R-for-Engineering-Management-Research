<title>
ORAL CARE SYSTEM FOR INTERDENTAL SPACE DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a controller for use with an oral care device; wherein the controller is configured to estimate the location of the oral care device relative to an interdental space in a mouth using predetermined data and current use data, the current use data relating to at least one of: actions of the user during use of the oral care device, operations of the oral care device; and generate a control signal based on the outcome of the estimation. There is also provided an oral care system and a kit of parts, and a computer implemented method for an oral care device.

<claims>
1. A controller for use with an oral care device; wherein
the controller is configured to
estimate the location of the oral care device relative to an interdental space in a mouth, using predetermined data and current use data, the current use data relating to at least one of: actions of a user during use of the oral care device, operations of the oral care device; and
generate a control signal based on the outcome of the estimation.
2. The controller as claimed in claim 1, wherein the control signal, during use, controls the oral care device to jet fluid when it is estimated that the oral care device is proximate to or at or inside an interdental space in the mouth.
3. The controller as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the current use data comprises at least one of:
a position of the oral care device relative to teeth; an orientation of the oral care device relative to teeth; a brushing force applied to the oral care device; a drivetrain current of the oral care device; a vibration frequency of the oral care device; a strain exerted on the oral care device; a deflection of a brush head of the oral care device; a light intensity generated by or of the oral care device; a sound intensity generated by or of the oral care device; a fluid backpressure of a fluid delivery system of the oral care device; a speed or velocity of the oral care device; a fluid delivery related sensor signal.
4. The controller as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the predetermined data comprises location data indicating locations of interdental spaces and training use data relating to at least one of: actions of the user during use of the oral care device, operations of the oral care device.
5. The controller as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the predetermined data is at least one of: produced using a learning algorithm, based on a statistical model, based on an interdental space detection algorithm.
6. The controller as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the estimation is based on a statistical model.
7. A system comprising a device which comprises the controller as claimed in any preceding claim.
8. The system as claimed in claim 7, wherein the device is at least one of: an oral care device, a remote device, a server, a handle for an oral cleaning device.
9. The system as claimed in claims 7 or 8, when read as appended to claim 4, further comprising at least one input device configured to obtain the location data.
10. The system as claimed in claim 9, wherein the at least one input device is comprised in at least one of: a training oral care device, a removable training head of the oral care device, a removable handle of the oral care device, a remote device, the oral care device.
11. The system as claimed in any of claims 7 to 10, when read as appended to claim 4, further comprising at least one sensor configured to obtain at least one of: current use data, training use data.
12. The system as claimed in claim 11, wherein at least one of the at least one sensor is comprised in at least one of: the oral care device, a remote device, a training oral care device, a removable training head of the oral care device, a removable handle of the oral care device.
13. A kit of parts for use in an oral care system, comprising an oral care device, further comprising at least one of:
(i) a first removable head for the oral care device comprising an input device configured to collect location data relating to the location of one or more interdental spaces in a mouth, and a second removable head for the oral care device that does not comprise the input device;
(ii) a first handle for receiving a head for the oral care device comprising an input device configured to collect the location data relating to the location of one or more interdental spaces in a mouth, and a second removable handle for the oral care device that does not comprise the input device;
(iii) a remote device comprising an input device configured to collect the location data relating to the location of one or more interdental spaces in a mouth. 14. A training head for an oral care device for use in the system of any of claims 9 to 12, wherein the training head comprises the input device.
15. A computer implemented method for a controller of an oral care device, the method comprising:
estimating the location of the oral care device relative to an interdental space in a mouth using predetermined data and current use data, the current use data relating to at least one of: actions of a user during use of the oral care device, operations of the oral care device; and
generating a control signal based on the outcome of the estimation.
