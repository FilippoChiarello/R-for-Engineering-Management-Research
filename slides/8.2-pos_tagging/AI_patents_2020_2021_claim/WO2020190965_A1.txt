SIGNALING DESIGN FOR A USER EQUIPMENT OPERATING IN AN UNLICENSED SPECTRUM
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are methods, systems, apparatus, computer programs, or combinations thereof, for selecting a mode of operation for a user equipment (UE) that operates within an unlicensed spectrum. A method includes identifying information from which to determine the mode of operation, where the UE is served by a radio access network (RAN) operating in an unlicensed radio frequency spectrum band; determining, based on the information, an indication of regional ?mode or global mode; and operating in the determined mode of operation.

<claims>
What is claimed is: 1. A method for determining a mode of operation of a user equipment (UE), the method comprising:
identifying information from which to determine the mode of operation, wherein the UE is served by a radio access network (RAN) operating in an unlicensed radio frequency spectrum band;
determining, based on the information, an indication of regional mode or global mode; and
operating in the determined mode of operation. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the information is the UE's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) or country code, and wherein determining, based on the information, an indication of regional mode or global mode comprises:
determining, based on the UE's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) or country code, geographic information indicative of a current region of the UE;
determining operational requirements of the current region; and
determining, based on the operational requirements of the current region, the mode of operation. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying information from which to determine the mode of operation comprises:
identifying the information as a field in a received System Information Block Type1 (SIB1). 4. The method of claim 3, wherein the field is plmn-IdentityList or trackingAreaCode, wherein plmn-IdentityList is indicative of a current UE location or a current UE location area code, wherein trackingAreaCode is indicative of operator tracking area codes, and wherein determining, based on the information, an indication of regional mode or global mode comprises: using a lookup table that indicates a respective mode of operation that corresponds to each value of plmn-IdentityList or trackingAreaCode to determine the mode of operation that corresponds to values of plmn-IdentityList or trackingAreaCode. 5. The method of claim 3, wherein the field is ModeOfOperation, wherein ModeOfOperation is a field that is added to legacy SIB1, wherein the ModeOfOperation field has two enumerated values {Global, Regional}, and wherein determining, based on the information, an indication of regional mode or global mode comprises:
determining, based on the ModeOfOperation field, the mode of operation. 6. The method of claim 3, wherein the field is an existing field of legacy SIB1 that is reinterpreted to indicate the mode of operation. 7. The method of claim 1, wherein the information is a physical central frequency of the unlicensed spectrum, wherein each mode of operation is associated with a respective physical central frequency, and wherein determining, based on the information, an indication of regional mode or global mode comprises:
determining the mode of operation that corresponds to the physical central frequency of the unlicensed spectrum. 8. The method of claim 1, wherein the information is a configuration of a physical random access channel (PRACH), and wherein determining, based on the information, an indication of regional mode or global mode comprises:
determining whether the configuration is a legacy configuration;
if the PRACH is configured with a legacy configuration, determining to operate in regional mode; and
if a new PRACH is used, determining to operate in global mode. 9. A non-transitory computer-readable storage device having stored thereon instructions, which, when executed by a data processing apparatus, cause the data processing apparatus to perform operations comprising: identifying information from which to determine the mode of operation, wherein the UE is served by a radio access network (RAN) operating in an unlicensed radio frequency spectrum band;
determining, based on the information, an indication of regional mode or global mode; and
operating in the determined mode of operation. 10. The non-transitory computer-readable storage device of claim 9, wherein the information is the UE's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) or country code, and wherein determining, based on the information, an indication of regional mode or global mode comprises:
determining, based on the UE's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) or country code, geographic information indicative of a current region of the UE;
determining operational requirements of the current region; and
determining, based on the operational requirements of the current region, the mode of operation. 11. The non-transitory computer-readable storage device of claim 9, wherein identifying information from which to determine the mode of operation comprises: identifying the information as a field in a received System Information Block Type1 (SIB1). 12. The non-transitory computer-readable storage device of claim 11, wherein the field is plmn-IdentityList or trackingAreaCode, wherein plmn-IdentityList is indicative of a current UE location or a current UE location area code, wherein trackingAreaCode is indicative of operator tracking area codes, and wherein determining, based on the information, an indication of regional mode or global mode comprises:
using a lookup table that indicates a respective mode of operation that corresponds to each value of plmn-IdentityList or trackingAreaCode to determine the mode of operation that corresponds to values of plmn-IdentityList or trackingAreaCode. 13. The non-transitory computer-readable storage device of claim 11, wherein the field is ModeOfOperation, wherein ModeOfOperation is a field that is added to legacy SIB1, wherein the ModeOfOperation field has two enumerated values {Global, Regional}, and wherein determining, based on the information, an indication of regional mode or global mode comprises:
determining, based on the ModeOfOperation field, the mode of operation. 14. The non-transitory computer-readable storage device of claim 11, wherein the field is an existing field of legacy SIB1 that is reinterpreted to indicate the mode of operation. 15. The non-transitory computer-readable storage device of claim 9, wherein the information is a physical central frequency of the unlicensed spectrum, wherein each mode of operation is associated with a respective physical central frequency, and wherein determining, based on the information, an indication of regional mode or global mode comprises:
determining the mode of operation that corresponds to the physical central frequency of the unlicensed spectrum. 16. The non-transitory computer-readable storage device of claim 9, wherein the information is a configuration of a physical random access channel (PRACH), and wherein determining, based on the information, an indication of regional mode or global mode comprises:
determining whether the configuration is a legacy configuration;
if the PRACH is configured with a legacy configuration, determining to operate in regional mode; and
if a new PRACH is used, determining to operate in global mode. 17. A system comprising:
one or more processors and one or more storage devices storing instructions that are operable, when executed by the one or more processors, to cause the one or more processors to perform operations comprising:
identifying information from which to determine the mode of operation, wherein the UE is served by a radio access network (RAN) operating in an unlicensed radio frequency spectrum band; determining, based on the information, an indication of regional mode or global mode; and
