<title>
NAVIGATING A VEHICLE BASED ON A DETECTED BARRIER
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided for navigating an autonomous vehicle. In one implementation, a system for navigating a vehicle includes at least one processing device programmed to receive, from an image capture device, a plurality of images associated with an environment of the vehicle, analyze at least one of the plurality of images to identify a navigable region in the environment of the vehicle, identify, based on the at least one of the plurality of images, at least one barrier associated with an edge of the navigable region, and determine a type of the at least one barrier. The at least one processing device is also programmed to determine a navigational path of the vehicle based on the determined type of the at least one barrier, and cause the vehicle to travel on at least a portion of the determined navigational path.

1. 1-20. (canceled)
21. A vehicle navigation system for a vehicle, the vehicle navigation system comprising: a memory including instructions; and one or more processors that, when in operation, are configured by the instructions to: analyze at least one of a plurality of images to identify a lane of the vehicle in which the vehicle travels, the plurality of images captured by a camera of the vehicle; identify, based on the at least one of the plurality of images, a lane marking separating a current lane of the vehicle and an adjacent lane; identify a candidate vehicle forward of the vehicle in the lane in which the vehicle travels; and cause the vehicle to traverse the lane marking to change to the adjacent lane in response to identifying the candidate vehicle as an obstacle forward of the vehicle.
22. The vehicle navigation system of claim 21, wherein, to identify the candidate vehicle, the instructions configure the one or more processors to use radar.
23. The vehicle navigation system of claim 21, wherein the candidate vehicle is moving slower than the vehicle.
24. The vehicle navigation system of claim 21, wherein the instructions configure the one or more processors to traverse the lane marking to change to the adjacent lane without input from a driver of the vehicle.
25. The vehicle navigation system of claim 21, wherein, to cause the vehicle to traverse the lane marking to change to the adjacent lane, the instructions configure the one or more processors to make a change in acceleration.
26. The vehicle navigation system of claim 25, wherein the change in acceleration increases the acceleration.
27. The vehicle navigation system of claim 21, wherein the instructions configure the one or more processors to estimate, by use of a machine learning system, a future path of the vehicle ahead of a current location of the vehicle.
28. A non-transitory machine-readable medium including instructions that, when executed by circuitry of a vehicle component, cause the circuitry to perform operations comprising: analyzing at least one of a plurality of images to identify a lane of the vehicle in which the vehicle travels, the plurality of images captured by a camera of the vehicle; identifying, based on the at least one of the plurality of images, a lane marking separating a current lane of the vehicle and an adjacent lane; identifying a candidate vehicle forward of the vehicle in the lane in which the vehicle travels; and causing the vehicle to traverse the lane marking to change to the adjacent lane in response to identifying the candidate vehicle as an obstacle forward of the vehicle.
29. The machine-readable medium of claim 28, wherein identifying the candidate vehicle includes using radar.
30. The machine-readable medium of claim 28, wherein the candidate vehicle is moving slower than the vehicle.
31. The machine-readable medium of claim 28, wherein causing the vehicle to traverse the lane marking to change to the adjacent lane is performed without input from a driver of the vehicle.
32. The machine-readable medium of claim 28, wherein causing the vehicle to traverse the lane marking to change to the adjacent lane includes making a change in acceleration.
33. The machine-readable medium of claim 32, wherein the change in acceleration increases the acceleration.
34. The machine-readable medium of claim 28, comprising estimating, by use of a machine learning system, a future path of the vehicle ahead of a current location of the vehicle.
35. A vehicle comprising: a camera; and a vehicle navigation system configured to: analyze at least one of a plurality of images to identify a lane of the vehicle in which the vehicle travels, the plurality of images captured by the camera; identify, based on the at least one of the plurality of images, a lane marking separating a current lane of the vehicle and an adjacent lane; identify a candidate vehicle forward of the vehicle in the lane in which the vehicle travels; and cause the vehicle to traverse the lane marking to change to the adjacent lane in response to identifying the candidate vehicle as an obstacle forward of the vehicle.
36. The vehicle of claim 35, wherein, to identify the candidate vehicle, the vehicle navigation system is configured to use radar.
37. The vehicle of claim 35, wherein the candidate vehicle is moving slower than the vehicle.
38. The vehicle of claim 35, wherein the vehicle navigation system is configured to traverse the lane marking to change to the adjacent lane without input from a driver of the vehicle.
39. The vehicle of claim 35, wherein, to cause the vehicle to traverse the lane marking to change to the adjacent lane, the vehicle navigation system is configured to make a change in acceleration.
40. The vehicle of claim 39, wherein the change in acceleration increases the acceleration.
41. The vehicle of claim 35, wherein the vehicle navigation system is configured to estimate, by use of a machine learning system, a future path of the vehicle ahead of a current location of the vehicle.
