MOBILITY CONDITION CHANGE BASED ON SERVING CELL QUALITY AND CONNECTION RELEASE
</title>

<abstract>
A method and apparatus for mobility condition change based on serving cell quality and connection release in a wireless communication system is provided. A wireless device receives information on a first condition related to a conditional mobility to a target cell, detects a serving cell problem, performs the conditional mobility to the target cell based on a second condition related to a cell selection, and performs a connection release with the target cell.
</abstract>

<claims>
[Claim 1] A method for a wireless device in a wireless communication system, the method comprising:
receiving information on a first condition related to a conditional mobility to a target cell;
detecting a serving cell problem;
performing the conditional mobility to the target cell based on a second condition related to a cell selection; and
performing a connection release with the target cell.
[Claim 2] The method of claim 1, wherein the second condition corresponds to a cell selection criterion.
[Claim 3] The method of claim 2, wherein the conditional mobility to the target cell is performed upon that the cell selection criterion is satisfied, and wherein the cell selection criterion is satisfied upon that a measurement result of the target cell is above a default threshold.
[Claim 4] The method of claim 3, wherein the conditional mobility to the target cell is performed upon that the measurement result of the target cell is above the default threshold, regardless of a quality of a serving cell.
[Claim 5] The method of claim 1, wherein the first condition is configured by comparison between a measurement result of the target cell and a mea surement result of a serving cell.
[Claim 6] The method of claim 5, wherein the first condition is that the mea surement result of the target cell is better than the measurement result of the serving cell by an offset.
[Claim 7] The method of claim 5, wherein the serving cell is a primary cell
(PCell).
[Claim 8] The method of claim 1, wherein the serving cell problem is detected upon 1) expiry of a timer, which starts to running upon receiving Nconsecutive out-of-sync indications for a serving cell from lower layers, 2) receiving a random access problem indication from a media access control (MAC) entity of a master cell group (MCG), or receiving an indication from a radio link control (RLC) entity of the MCG that a maximum number of retransmissions has been reached.
[Claim 9] The method of claim 1, wherein the information on the first condition is received via a configuration for the conditional mobility.
[Claim 10] The method of claim 9, wherein the configuration includes a list of candidate target cells including the target cell. [Claim 11] The method of claim 10, wherein the list of candidate target cells
includes an identifier (ID) of the candidate target cells.
[Claim 12] The method of claim 9, wherein the configuration includes an ID of the serving cell and/or type of the conditional mobility.
[Claim 13] The method of claim 1, wherein the conditional mobility includes a conditional serving cell change, a conditional serving cell addition and / or a conditional serving cell release.
[Claim 14] The method of claim 1, wherein the wireless device is in commu
nication with at least one of a mobile device, a network, and/or au tonomous vehicles other than the wireless device.
[Claim 15] A wireless device in a wireless communication system, the wireless device comprising:
at least one transceiver;
at least processor; and
at least one computer memory operably connectable to the at least one processor and storing instructions that, based on being executed by the at least one processor, perform operations comprising:
receiving information on a first condition related to a conditional mobility to a target cell;
detecting a serving cell problem;
performing the conditional mobility to the target cell based on a second condition related to a cell selection; and
performing a connection release with the target cell.
