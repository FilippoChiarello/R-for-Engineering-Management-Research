VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF DIRECTIONAL CORRELATION OF SERVICE HEALTH
</title>

<abstract>
A system for generating proportional diagrams. The system includes a user interface, a memory for storing executable program code, and one or more electronic processors. The electronic processors are functionally coupled to the memory and the user interface. The electronic processors are configured to receive a dataset from one or more servers, wherein the dataset comprises software service health data. The electronic processors are further configured to remove extraneous data from the dataset, extract relevant data points from the dataset, and determine one or more relational data strings within the extracted relevant data points. The electronic processors are also configured to determine a frequency of occurrence for each of the extracted relevant data points within the dataset, and generate the proportional relationship diagram by plotting the relevant data points, wherein the relevant data points are plotted based on the determined relational data string and the determine frequency of occurrence.
