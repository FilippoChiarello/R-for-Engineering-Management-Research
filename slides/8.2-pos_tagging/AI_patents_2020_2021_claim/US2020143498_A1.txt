<title>
INTELLIGENT CAREER PLANNING IN A COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments for intelligent career planning actions in a computing environment by a processor. A career planning model may be created for a user according to a career goal, a user profile, and one or more alternative user profiles and historical data of alternative users having achieved the career goal. A career plan may be generated for the user according to the career planning model.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method, by a processor, for intelligent career planning actions in a computing environment, comprising: creating a career planning model for a user according to a career goal, a user profile, and one or more alternative user profiles and historical data of alternative users having achieved the career goal; generating a career plan for the user according to the career planning model.
2. The method of claim 1, further including identifying a series of actions steps for achieving the career goal.
3. The method of claim 1, further including identifying a subset of actions for having a negative impact on achieving the career goal.
4. The method of claim 1, further including inferring one or more actions steps for completing a series of actions for achieving the career goal.
5. The method of claim 1, further including synthesizing the career planning model from a series of actions steps for achieving the career goal.
6. The method of claim 1, further including identifying positive or negative impacts for achieving the career goal according to alternative results generated from selecting alternative choices at each actions step performed by the alternative users to achieve the career goal.
7. The method of claim 1, further including: identifying a plurality of valid career path trajectories having a series of actions steps for achieving the career goal; and selecting one or more of the plurality of valid career path trajectories having greater positive impact upon the user for achieving the career goal as compared to alternative ones of the plurality of valid career path trajectories.
8. A system for intelligent career planning actions in a computing environment, comprising: one or more computers with executable instructions that when executed cause the system to: create a career planning model for a user according to a career goal, a user profile, and one or more alternative user profiles and historical data of alternative users having achieved the career goal; and generate a career plan for the user according to the career planning model.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions further identify a series of actions steps for achieving the career goal.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions further identify a subset of actions for having a negative impact on achieving the career goal.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions further infer one or more actions steps for completing a series of actions for achieving the career goal.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions further synthesize the career planning model from a series of actions steps for achieving the career goal.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions further identify positive or negative impacts for achieving the career goal according to alternative results generated from selecting alternative choices at each actions step performed by the alternative users to achieve the career goal.
14. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions further: identify a plurality of valid career path trajectories having a series of actions steps for achieving the career goal; and select one or more of the plurality of valid career path trajectories having greater positive impact upon the user for achieving the career goal as compared to alternative ones of the plurality of valid career path trajectories.
15. A computer program product for intelligent career planning actions by a processor, the computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable program code portions stored therein, the computer-readable program code portions comprising: an executable portion that creates a career planning model for a user according to a career goal, a user profile, and one or more alternative user profiles and historical data of alternative users having achieved the career goal; and an executable portion that generates a career plan for the user according to the career planning model.
16. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that: identifies a series of actions steps for achieving the career goal; and identify a subset of actions for having a negative impact on achieving the career goal.
17. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that infers one or more actions steps for completing a series of actions for achieving the career goal.
18. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that synthesizes the career planning model from a series of actions steps for achieving the career goal.
19. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that identifies positive or negative impacts for achieving the career goal according to alternative results generated from selecting alternative choices at each actions step performed by the alternative users to achieve the career goal.
20. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that: identifies a plurality of valid career path trajectories having a series of actions steps for achieving the career goal; and selects one or more of the plurality of valid career path trajectories having greater positive impact upon the user for achieving the career goal as compared to alternative ones of the plurality of valid career path trajectories.
