METHOD AND BRAKE CONTROL FOR ACTUATING A FRICTION BRAKE
</title>

<abstract>
For rapid and precise actuation of a friction brake, the thermal expansion of the friction brake is determined using a thermal model of the friction brake and therefrom the temperature-dependent shift in the contact point is determined for the braking operation and the temperature-dependent shift in the contact point is taken into account when determining the actuation measure of the friction brake to be adjusted.

4. The method according to claim 3, wherein the kinetic energy of the pressing device and/or of the actuating device, or parts thereof, required to overcome the air gap is taken into account when determining the effect measure.
5. The method according to claim 4, wherein the temperature-dependent shift of the contact point is taken into account when determining the kinetic energy required to overcome the air gap.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein, during the braking operation, a spring acts at least temporarily on the pressing device and/or the actuating device and the effect of the spring is taken into account when determining the effect measure.
