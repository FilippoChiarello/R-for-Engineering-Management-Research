<abstract>
Examples of the disclosure enable an information processing system to automatically implement a user interaction diagnostic engine. In some examples, the information processing system analyzes documents to identify parameters associated with profile features and performance metrics. Based on the parameters, correlation values between the profile features and one or more performance metrics are determined. Based on the correlation values, at least one profile feature is identified to improve a parameter associated with the performance metrics. A predictive model associated with the profile features and the performance metrics is generated. One or more actionable items configured to modify the at least one profile feature are determined such that, based on the predictive model, a parameter associated with the performance metrics are predicted to improve upon execution of the one or more actionable items.
