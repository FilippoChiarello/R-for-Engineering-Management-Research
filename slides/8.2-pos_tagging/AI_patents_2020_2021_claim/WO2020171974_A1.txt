PROVIDING OUTCOME EXPLANATION FOR ALGORITHMIC DECISIONS
</title>

<abstract>
Computer systems and methods are provided for training a machine learning system to determine an authentication decision and explanation information corresponding to the authentication decision. First authentication information for a first authentication request including a first image is received. First validation information corresponding to the first image and including a first authentication decision and first explanation information is received. Data storage of a machine learning system stores the first image and the first validation information. The machine learning system updates an authentication model based on the stored first image and first validation information. Second authentication information for a second authentication request is received. The machine learning system determines second validation information, including second explanation information, based on the updated authentication model. The second explanation information is provided for display to a user device.
