METHOD OF OPERATING TRANSMITTING UE IN RELATION TO RLF REPORTING IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A method of operating a transmitting user equipment (UE) in a wireless communication system includes establishing a link with a Rx UE by the Tx UE, and transmitting an RRC message based on sidelink radio link failure (RLF) to a base station (BS) by the Tx UE. The RRC message is related to reporting of the sidelink RLF to the BS, and includes a destination identifier (ID) related to the sidelink RLF.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of operating a Tx user equipment (UE) in a wireless communication system, the method comprising: establishing, by the Tx UE, a link with a Rx UE; and transmitting, by the Tx UE, a radio resource control (RRC) message based on sidelink radio link failure (RLF) to a base station (BS), wherein the RRC message is related to reporting of the sidelink RLF to the BS, and wherein the RRC message includes a destination identifier (ID) related to the sidelink RLF.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the destination ID is related to transmission resource allocation of the BS.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the sidelink RLF is based on retransmission occurrences of a maximum retransmission number.
4. The method according to claim 2, wherein the transmission resource allocation of the BS, related to the destination ID is not performed.
5. The method according to claim 2, wherein the Tx UE does not transmit a transmission resource request related to the destination ID any longer after transmitting the RRC message.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the transmission resource request is one of a scheduling request (SR) and a sidelink buffer status report (BSR).
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein the sidelink RLF is based on reception of an OUT OF SYNC indication a predetermined number of or more times.
8. The method according to claim 1, wherein the destination ID is generated by a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) layer of the Tx UE.
9. The method according to claim 1, wherein the RRC message is transmitted, when a latency budget of data transmission in service is larger than a delay until transmission resources are allocated by the BS.
10. The method according to claim 1, wherein the Tx UE communicates with at least one of another UE, a UE related to autonomous driving vehicle, a BS, or a network.
11. A Tx user equipment (UE) in a wireless communication system, the Tx UE comprising: at least one processor; and at least one computer memory operatively coupled to the at least one processor and storing instructions which, when executed, cause the at least one processor to perform operations, wherein the operations include establishing a link with a Rx UE, and transmitting a radio resource control (RRC) message based on sidelink radio link failure (RLF) to a base station (BS), wherein the RRC message is related to reporting of the sidelink RLF to the BS, and wherein the RRC message includes a destination identifier (ID) related to the sidelink RLF.
12. A computer-readable storage medium storing at least one computer program including instructions which, when executed by at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to perform operations for a user equipment (UE), wherein the operations include establishing a link with a Rx UE, and transmitting a radio resource control (RRC) message based on sidelink radio link failure (RLF) to a base station (BS), wherein the RRC message is related to reporting of the sidelink RLF to the BS, and wherein the RRC message includes a destination identifier (ID) related to the sidelink RLF.
13. A base station (BS) in a wireless communication system, the BS comprising: at least one processor; and at least one computer memory operatively coupled to the at least one processor and storing instructions which, when executed, cause the at least one processor to perform operations, wherein the operations include receiving a radio resource control (RRC) message based on sidelink radio link failure (RLF) from a transmitting user equipment (UE), wherein the RRC message is related to reporting of the sidelink RLF to the BS, and wherein the RRC message includes a destination identifier (ID) related to the sidelink RLF.
