TIRE IMAGE RECOGNITION METHOD AND TIRE IMAGE RECOGNITION DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A method which includes obtaining a plurality of images of tires that differ from one another in either one of or both of a tire type and a tire condition, the obtained images being regarded as teacher images; converting the teacher images into a size of a predetermined number of pixels; learning by a convolutional neural network using data of the plurality of converted teacher images as learning images, and setting parameters of the convolutional neural network; obtaining a tire image of a recognition-target tire and converting the obtained tire image into a size identical to that of the teacher images; and inputting the converted tire image of the recognition-target tire to the convolutional neural network and determining either one of or both of the type and the condition of the recognition-target tire.

<claims>
1. A tire image recognition method, comprising: a step of obtaining a plurality of images of tires that differ from one another in either one of or both of a tire type and a tire condition, the obtained images being regarded as teacher images; a step of converting the respective teacher images into a size of a predetermined number of pixels; a step of learning by a convolution neural network using data of the plurality of converted teacher images as learning images, and setting parameters for the convolution neural network; a step of obtaining a tire image of a recognition-target tire and converting the obtained tire image into a size identical to that of the teacher images; and a step of inputting the converted tire image of the recognition-target tire to the convolution neural network and determining either one of or both of the tire type and the tire condition of the recognition-target tire.
2. The tire image recognition method according to claim 1, wherein, the tire type or the tire condition is either one of a tread pattern, a tread wear amount and a clack in a side tread.
3. The tire image recognition method according to claim 1, wherein at least one pattern periodic structure is captured in the teacher images and the tire image of the recognition-target tire.
4. The tire image recognition method according to claim 1, wherein, the teacher images and the tire image of the recognition-target tire are converted into gray scale, and gradations of the gray scale are normalized in a range of 0 to 1.
5. A tire image recognition device, comprising: a tire image capturing means that captures a plurality of teacher images and a recognition-target image, the teacher images being images of tires that differ from one another in either one of or both of a tire type and a tire condition; an image data converting means that converts the teacher images and the recognition-target image into a size of a predetermined number of pixels; a feature amount extracting means that extracts feature amounts of the images converted by the image data converting means; and a determining means that compares feature amounts of the recognition-target image with feature amounts of the teacher images to determine either one of or the both of the tire type and the tire condition of the target tire, wherein the feature amount extracting means includes a convolution layer and a pooling layer of a convolutional neural network in which the teacher images are configured as learning images, and wherein the determining means includes a fully connected layer of the convolutional neural network.
