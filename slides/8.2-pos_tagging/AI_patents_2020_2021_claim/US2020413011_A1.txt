CONTROLLING IMAGE ACQUISITION ROBOTS IN CONSTRUCTION SITES
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods and non-transitory computer readable media for controlling image acquisition robots in construction sites are provided. For example, a first image corresponding to a first point in time and a second image corresponding to a second point in time may be obtained. The first image and the second image may be analyzed to determine whether a change occurred in a particular area of a construction site between the first point in time and the second point in time. It may be determined whether a higher quality image of the particular area of the construction site is needed. An image acquisition robot may be controlled based on the determination of whether a change occurred in the particular area of the construction site and the determination of whether a higher quality image is needed.

12. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises: analyzing at least part of the plurality of images to determine a type of the change that occurred in the particular area of the construction site between the first point in time and the second point in time; in response to a first determined type of the change, causing the image acquisition robot to acquire the at least one image of the particular area of the construction site; and in response to a second determined type of the change, withholding causing the image acquisition robot to acquire the at least one image of the particular area of the construction site.
13. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises: analyzing at least part of the plurality of images to select at least one image capturing parameter; and in response to the determination that a change occurred in the particular area of the construction site and the determination that a higher quality image is needed, causing the image acquisition robot to acquire at least one image of the particular area of the construction site using the selected at least one image capturing parameter.
14. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises: analyzing at least part of the plurality of images to determine a type of the change that occurred in the particular area of the construction site between the first point in time and the second point in time; in response to a first determined type of the change, causing the image acquisition robot to acquire the at least one image of the particular area of the construction site using a first image capturing parameter; and in response to a second determined type of the change, causing the image acquisition robot to acquire the at least one image of the particular area of the construction site using a second image capturing parameter, the second image capturing parameter differs from the first image capturing parameter.
