<abstract>
An electromechanical device for rehabilitation includes pedals coupled to radially-adjustable couplings, an electric motor coupled to the pedals via the radially-adjustable couplings, and a control system including a processing device operatively coupled to the electric motor. The processing device configured to, responsive to a first trigger condition occurring, control the electric motor to operate in a passive mode by independently driving the radially-adjustable couplings rotationally coupled to the pedals. The processing device also configured to, responsive to a second trigger condition occurring, control the electric motor to operate in an active-assisted mode by measuring revolutions per minute of the radially-adjustable couplings, and cause the electric motor to drive the radially-adjustable couplings when the measured revolutions per minute satisfy a threshold condition, and responsive to a third trigger condition occurring, control the electric motor to operate in a resistive mode by providing resistance to rotation of the radially-adjustable couplings.
