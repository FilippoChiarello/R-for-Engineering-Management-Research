<title>
Artificial neural network for reservoir computing using stochastic logic
</title>

<abstract>
An artificial neuron includes a signal mixer that combines input signals to provide a first stochastic bit-stream as output and a stochastic activation function circuit configured to receive the first stochastic bit-stream from the signal mixer and to generate therefrom a second stochastic bit-stream. The first stochastic bit-stream is representative of a first output value. In the stochastic activation function circuit, n independent stochastic bit-streams, each representative of the first output value, are summed to provide a selection signal that is provided to a multiplexer to select between n+1 coefficient bit-streams and provide the second stochastic bit-stream. The activation function has a characteristic determined by the proportion of ones in each of the n+1 coefficients bit-streams. One or more artificial neurons may be used in an Artificial Neural Network, such as a Time Delay Reservoir network.
