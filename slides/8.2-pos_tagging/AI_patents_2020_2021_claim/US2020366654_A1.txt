Secure Messaging Systems and Methods
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for secure messaging and automation are disclosed herein. An example method includes providing, by an application server layer, a user-facing application that accesses a data retention system and a predictive analytics system through a web services layer, the user-facing application being secured through use of a security token cached on a web browser that provides the user-facing application, establishing a security protocol or security token utilized between the application server layer and the web services layer that is different from the security token cached on the web browser; and performing asynchronous processing based on user interaction with a goal-based planning application that processes data from a plurality of user accounts.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A secure messaging system configured by at least one processor to execute instructions stored in memory, the system comprising: a data retention system and a predictive analytics system; a web services layer providing access to the data retention and predictive analytics systems; an application server layer that: provides a user-facing application that accesses the data retention and predictive analytics systems through the web services layer; and performs processing based on user interaction with a goal-based planning application, the goal-based planning application configured to execute instructions including: determining a pillar score for each of a plurality of pillars, the pillar score being a weighted percentage of a financial wellness score, each of the plurality of pillars including a component data attribute, the component data attribute being a weighted percentage of the pillar score for each of the plurality of pillars; and calculating the financial wellness score using the pillar score for each of the plurality of pillars.
2. The secure messaging system of claim 1, further comprising the data retention system and the predictive analytics system are both in secure isolation from a remainder of the secure messaging system.
3. The secure messaging system of claim 1, further comprising the user-facing application being secured through use of a security token cached on a web browser that provides the user-facing application.
4. The secure messaging system of claim 1, further comprising the application server layer performing asynchronous processing.
5. The secure messaging system of claim 1, further comprising the goal-based planning application processing data from a plurality of user accounts.
6. The secure messaging system of claim 1, further comprising a batching service, wherein the application server layer transmits a request to the web services layer for data, the request processed by the batching service transparently to a user.
7. The secure messaging system of claim 1, further comprising the request processed by the batching service transparently to a user such that the user can continue to use the user-facing application without disruption.
8. The secure messaging system of claim 1, the plurality of pillars including a monthly cash flow pillar, a financial freedom pillar, a security pillar, a personal organization pillar, and a decay element pillar.
9. The secure messaging system of claim 8, the monthly cash flow pillar having the component data attribute of savings as a percentage of gross income or a credit score.
10. The secure messaging system of claim 8, the financial freedom pillar having the component data attribute of a retirement goal status, 401k savings, 403B savings, IRA savings, an investment strategy, or automated savings.
11. The secure messaging system of claim 8, the security pillar having the component data attribute of an emergency goal, a funding emergency goal, a saving plan on track, adequate insurance coverage, or an estate plan.
12. The secure messaging system of claim 8, the personal organization pillar having the component data attribute of a financial account linked to a net worth dashboard, or record keeping.
13. The secure messaging system of claim 8, the decay element pillar having the component data attribute of an amount of educational content consumed online, an amount of interaction with a financial advisor or a login frequency to view the financial wellness score.
14. The secure messaging system of claim 1, further comprising each pillar and each component data attribute having a corresponding piece of advice to advance a user within the pillar.
15. The secure messaging system of claim 14, further comprising the corresponding piece of advice having an advice score.
16. The secure messaging system of claim 14, further comprising the corresponding piece of advice being based on machine learning and predictive analytics, the machine learning and the predictive analytics using user cohort behaviors.
17. The secure messaging system of claim 14, further comprising determining if the corresponding piece of advice was followed.
18. The secure messaging system of claim 14, further comprising determining if another piece of advice was followed before the corresponding piece of advice.
19. The secure messaging system of claim 15, further comprising the advice score being inversely related to the financial wellness score for a pillar.
20. The secure messaging system of claim 15, further comprising the corresponding piece of advice being prioritized based upon the advice score.
