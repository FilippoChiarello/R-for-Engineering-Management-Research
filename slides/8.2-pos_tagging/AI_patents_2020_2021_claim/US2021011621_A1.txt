<title>
Virtual Keyboard Engagement
</title>

<abstract>
The discussion relates to virtual keyboard engagement. One example can define key volumes relating to keys of a virtual keyboard and detect finger movement of a user through individual key volumes. The example can detect parameter changes associated with detected finger movement through individual key volumes and build potential key sequences from detected parameter changes.

<claims>
1. A device, comprising: a display component configured to be positioned on a head of user in front of the user's eyes and configured to generate virtual content that appears to the user in a scene; sensors configured to monitor volumes of the scene that extend both in front of and behind the virtual content relative to the user; and, a processor configured to assign probabilities to user movement relative to the volumes and to predict an intended user action relative to the virtual content based at least in part on the probabilities.
2. The device of claim 1, wherein the virtual content comprises a keyboard or wherein the virtual content comprises multiple user selectable elements.
3. The device of claim 1, wherein the sensors are configured to detect parameters associated with the movement of a user extremity through the volumes.
4. The device of claim 3, wherein the parameters relate to velocity and direction relative to individual volumes.
5. The device of claim 4, wherein the virtual content is associated with keys associated with characters, and wherein the processor is configured to compare a sequence of characters associated with the movement to a dictionary of known words to predict the intended user action as spelling an individual word from the dictionary.
6. The device of claim 5, wherein the processor is configured to perform the intended user action.
7. The device of claim 6, wherein the processor is configured to perform the intended user action by auto-populating the individual word into a dialog box or providing the individual word as an auto-suggestion for the dialog box.
8. The device of claim 7, wherein the processor is configured to perform the auto-populating when a confidence associated with the individual word exceeds a threshold.
9. A device-implemented method, comprising: generating a virtual keyboard with head mounted optics positioned in front of eyes of a user; detecting a path of a user extremity in 3D space proximate to a perceived position of the virtual keyboard; assigning probabilities to individual keys of the virtual keyboard when the path passes through a volume defined at least in part by the individual keys; predicting an intended user action based at least in part on the probabilities; and, automatically taking an action on behalf of the user based at least in part upon the predicted intended user action.
10. The device-implemented method of claim 9, wherein detecting a path of a user extremity comprises at least one of: detecting the path of a finger, multiple fingers, a hand, fingers of both a left and right hand, and an object held in the hand.
11. The device-implemented method of claim 9, wherein assigning probabilities to individual keys of the virtual keyboard comprises assigning a first probability to an individual key of the virtual keyboard when the path passes through a volume defined at least in part by the individual key.
12. The device-implemented method of claim 9, wherein assigning probabilities to individual keys of the virtual keyboard comprises assigning a first probability to an individual key of the keyboard when the path passes relative to the individual key under first parameters and assigning a second higher probability to another individual key when the path passes relative to the another individual key under second parameters.
13. The device-implemented method of claim 12, wherein taking an action comprises populating a dialog box with a word selected based at least in part upon the at least one of the first probability and the second higher probability.
14. A device-implemented method, comprising: generating virtual content with a device positioned on a head of a user, the virtual content appearing to the user in a volume beyond the device; defining virtual content volumes relating to individual portions of the virtual content, detecting finger movement of a user through individual virtual content volumes; detecting parameter changes associated with detected finger movement through individual virtual content volumes; and, building potential user selections of the individual virtual content from detected parameter changes.
15. The device-implemented method of claim 14, wherein generating virtual content comprises generating a virtual keyboard and the defining virtual content volumes comprises defining cuboids that include keys of the virtual keyboard, or wherein the defining virtual content volumes comprises defining frustrums that include the keys.
16. The device-implemented method of claim 15, wherein detecting parameter changes comprises detecting at least one of changes in direction and changes in velocity.
17. The device-implemented method of claim 16, wherein detecting parameter changes in direction comprises at least one of: detecting changes in direction parallel to a key surface and detecting changes in a direction perpendicular to the key surface.
18. The device-implemented method of claim 17, wherein the detecting parameter changes further comprises assigning higher probabilities to individual keys in potential key sequences associated with parameter changes.
19. The device-implemented method of claim 18, further comprising comparing the potential key sequences to known words.
20. The device-implemented method of claim 18, further comprising comparing the potential key sequences to known user commands.
