<title>
Calibration of initial orientation and position of sports equipment and body segments for inertial sensors
</title>

<abstract>
A player calibrates the initial position and orientation of trajectory using their natural sports motion from a well-defined starting point. For example, a batter with mature swing mechanics maintains approximately the same bat orientation and position ("load configuration") at the beginning of their swing. This load configuration is unique to that player and unlike that of other players and may represent the start of a swing (or other motion of interest) or may occur at any characteristic point in time during the motion. Subsequent motion data within the spatial frame can be accurately analyzed so that three-dimensional trajectory of the equipment or body segment can be precisely determined and presented in an animated playing environment on devices such as smartphones, tablets and laptops.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for calibrating and using a load configuration for a sports implement or an anatomical feature, said method comprising the steps of: a.) collecting data corresponding to positions and orientations of said sports implement or anatomical movement of said subject relative to a known position and orientation of said sports implement or anatomical movement of said subject, said data being collected over the movement of said sports implement or the anatomical movement of a subject during their use of said sports implement; b.) calibrating a load configuration for the sports implement or anatomical movement by searching data of said collecting step and identifying data that corresponds to a selected rate of movement of said sports implement or a selected rate of anatomical movement of said subject that is consistent for repeated motions of said sports implement or said anatomical movement of said subject; and c.) using said load configuration to analyze the position and orientation of the sports implement or the anatomical movement of said subject that occur subsequent to or prior to or both subsequent to and prior to said load configuration.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the step of calibrating said load configuration is performed by recognizing data features that correspond to the selected position and orientation of said sports implement or anatomical movement of said subject of said load configuration.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein said load configuration corresponds to a given orientation and position of said sports implement or said anatomical movement of said subject during the movement of the sports implement or the anatomical movement.
4. The method of claim 3 wherein the load configuration is determined relative to a spatial reference frame.
5. The method of claim 4 wherein said step a of collecting data includes the use of an inertial sensor.
6. The method of claim 5 wherein said inertial sensor is attached to said sports implement or to an anatomical feature.
7. The method of claim 6 wherein said sports implement or said anatomical feature is placed in predetermined stationary position and orientation in said spatial reference frame.
8. The method of claim 7 wherein the predetermined stationary position and orientation are fixed and known with respect to the spatial reference frame.
9. The method of claim 8 wherein said relationship between the predetermined stationary position and orientation of said sports implement or said anatomical feature are included in a process for determining said load configuration.
10. The method of claim 9 wherein said sports implement or anatomical feature are moveable from the fixed, known position through said motion of said sports implement or the anatomical movement of said subject during their use of said sports implement.
11. The method of claim 10 wherein said user moves said sports implement or anatomical feature from the known, fixed position to a starting orientation and position that is comfortable to said user.
12. The method of claim 11 wherein said step b of calibrating said load configuration within the motion of said sports implement or anatomical movement of said subject includes motion feature recognition rules that correspond to components in a motion pattern.
13. The method of claim 11 wherein said step b of calibrating said load configuration within the motion of said sports implement or anatomical movement of said subject includes machine learning methods.
14. The method of claim 11 wherein said step b of calibrating said load configuration within the motion of said sports implement or anatomical movement of said subject defines: a.) a period when said sports implement or anatomical feature is in a predetermined, stationary position; b.) a time when said sports implement or anatomical feature is first moved from the predetermined, stationary position, c.) a time when said sports implement or anatomical feature is in the load configuration; d.) a time that normal movement of said user begins, and e.) a time of one or more significant motion events that occur during said normal movement of said user.
15. The method of claim 14 further comprising a motion reconstruction process that determines a calibration position and orientation.
16. The method of claim 15 wherein said motion reconstruction process includes the steps of: a.) stationary reconstruction; and b.) dynamic motion reconstruction.
