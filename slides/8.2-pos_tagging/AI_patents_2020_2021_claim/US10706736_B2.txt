Method and system for automatically scoring an essay using plurality of linguistic levels
</title>

<abstract>
The invention provides a method and system for automatically scoring a written essay using plurality of linguistic levels. The method and system includes an essay analysis module for analyzing each sentence of the essay written in Arabic language using a trained model. The essay analysis module utilizes the trained model for analyzing each sentence of the essay at plurality of linguistic levels and generates different scores at plurality of linguistic levels. The scores generated at plurality of linguistic levels are computed to generate a final score by using a weighted combination of the different scores.

<claims>
1. A method for scoring an essay written in a language, performed on a computing device having a processor and a memory storing a plurality of programs to be executed by the processor, wherein the essay comprises a plurality of sentences, the method comprising: analyzing, using a trained model communicatively coupled to the processor and the memory, the trained model including a set of essays with known scores, each sentence of the essay based on a plurality of linguistic levels, wherein the plurality of linguistic levels comprises a lexical level, a semantic level and a syntactic level, wherein the trained model is trained using the set of essays with known scores; generating a first score for the essay in response to analyzing each sentence of the essay at the lexical level, using the trained model, wherein analyzing the essay at the lexical level comprises performing a spell-check for each sentence of the essay using a lexicon based spell checker; generating a second score for the essay in response to analyzing, using the trained model, each sentence of the essay at the semantic level, wherein analyzing the essay at the semantic level comprises performing a semantic relationship between words in each sentence of the essay; generating a third score for the essay in response to analyzing, using the trained model, each sentence of the essay at the syntactic level using a tree kernel classifier embedded in a support vector machine, wherein analyzing the essay at the syntactic level using a tree kernel classifier comprises: generating a parse tree structure of each sentence of the essay; comparing, using the trained model, the parse tree structure of each sentence of the essay with at least one parse tree structure of at least one sentence of the set of essays with known scores; and generating, using the trained model, a score for each sentence of the essay based on a similarity level of the parse tree structure of each sentence with the at least one parse tree structure of the at least one sentence of the set of essays with known scores; computing a final score for the essay be using a weighted combination of the first score, the second score and the third score; and displaying the final score for the essay on a user interface of a computing device.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the language is Arabic.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein analyzing at the semantic level comprises assessing, using the trained model, a conceptual knowledge of the essay with the set of essays with known scores using Latent Semantic Analysis.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein a parse tree structure of each sentence of the essay is generated using Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG).
5. A system for scoring an essay written in a language, wherein the essay comprises a plurality of sentences, the system comprising: a computing device including: a processor; a memory; and a display communicatively coupled to the processor and the memory, the computing device configured to: analyze, using a trained model communicatively coupled to the processor and the memory, the trained model including a set of essays with known scores, each sentence of the essay based on a plurality of linguistic levels, wherein the plurality of linguistic levels comprises a lexical level, a semantic level and a syntactic level, the essay analyzed at the syntactic level using a tree-kernel classifier, the computing device further configured to: generate a parse tree structure of each sentence of the essay; and compare, using the trained model, the parse tree structure of each sentence of the essay with at least parse tree structure of at least one sentence of the set of essays with known scores; generate a first score for the essay in response to analyzing each sentence of the essay at the lexical level, the first score being stored in the memory, wherein analyzing the essay at the lexical level comprises performing a spell-check for each sentence of the essay using lexicon based spell checker; generate a second score for the essay in response to analyzing each sentence of the essay at the semantic level, the second score being stored in the memory, wherein analyzing the essay at the semantic level comprises analyzing a semantic relationship between words in each sentence of the essay using the trained model; generate a third score for the essay in response to analyzing each sentence of the essay at the syntactic level using the trained model, wherein the third score is stored in the memory; compute a final score for the essay by using a weighted combination of the first score, the second score and the third score, wherein the final score is stored in the memory; and display the final score for the essay on the display.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the language is Arabic.
7. The system of claim 5, wherein the computing device is configured to analyze the essay at the semantic level using the trained model by assessing a conceptual knowledge of the essay with the set of essays with known scores using Latent Semantic Analysis.
8. The system of claim 5, wherein the computing device is configured to generate, using the trained model, a score for each sentence of the essay based of a similarity level of the parse tree structure of each sentence with the at least one parse tree structure of the at least one sentence of the set of essays with known scores.
