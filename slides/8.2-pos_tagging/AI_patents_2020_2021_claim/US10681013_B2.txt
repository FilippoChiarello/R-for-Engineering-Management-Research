<title>
Methods and systems for concealing information
</title>

<abstract>
A retrieving system for retrieving information concealed within a sequence of symbols. The system includes a decoder configurable using rule information and operable when so configured to retrieve the information concealed within the sequence of symbols by applying to the sequence of symbols at least one decoder rule determined by the configuration of the encoder.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for retrieving information concealed within a sequence of symbols, the method comprising the steps of: a retrieving system, the retrieving system comprising a physical network interface in communication with the internet and a decoder, obtaining location information obtained using a Uniform Resource Locator (URL); the retrieving system obtaining rule information from a location indicated by the location information, the rule information being indicative of a rule for retrieving a discarded plurality of symbols; the retrieving system using the rule information obtained to configure the decoder; and the decoder retrieving the information concealed within the sequence of symbols by applying to the sequence of symbols at least one decoder rule determined by the configuration of the encoder.
2. The method defined by claim 1, comprising the step of operating the decoder on the sequence of symbols to retrieve the information within the sequence of symbols.
3. The method defined by claim 1, wherein the step of applying the at least one decoder rule comprises the step of grouping symbols from the sequence of symbols into a plurality of groups of symbols and changing the sequence of the plurality of groups of symbols.
4. The method defined by claim 3, comprising the step of using the rule information to determine a number of symbols in each of the plurality of groups of symbols.
5. The method defined by claim 4, wherein the step of using the rule information comprises the step of operating on symbols of the rule affecting information, to obtain a plurality of group size numbers indicative of the number of symbols in each of the plurality of groups.
6. The method defined by claim 5, comprising the step of separating the plurality of groups from a sequence of other symbols within the sequence of symbols.
7. A retrieving system for retrieving information concealed within a sequence of symbols, the system comprising: a physical network interface in communication with the Internet; a rule information determiner arranged to obtain rule information from a web site indicated by a URL and configured to obtain rule information from a location indicated by the location information, the rule information being indicative of a rule for retrieving a discarded plurality of symbols; a processer comprising a decoder configurable using the rule information, the processor being configured to configure the decoder using the rule information to retrieve the information concealed within the sequence of symbols by applying to the sequence of symbols at least one decoder rule determined by the configuration of the encoder.
8. The retrieving system defined by claim 7, comprising a grouping module arranged to group symbols from the sequence of symbols into a plurality of groups of symbols and changing the sequence of the plurality of groups of symbols.
9. The retrieving system defined by claim 8, wherein the grouping module is arranged to use the rule information to determine a number of symbols in each of the plurality of groups of symbols.
10. The retrieving system defined by claim 9, wherein the grouping module is arranged to operate on symbols of the rule affecting information with symbols of the sequence of symbols to obtain a plurality of group size numbers indicative of the number of symbols in each of the plurality of groups.
11. The retrieving system defined by claim 10, comprising a separation module arranged to separate the plurality of groups from a sequence of other symbols within the sequence of symbols.
12. Processor readable non-transitory, tangible media including program instructions which when executed by a processor causes the processor to perform a method for retrieving information concealed within a sequence of symbols, the method comprising the steps of: a retrieving system, the retrieving system comprising a physical network interface in communication with the internet and a decoder, obtaining location information obtained using a Uniform Resource Locator (URL); the retrieving system obtaining rule information from a location indicated by the location information, the rule information being indicative of a rule for retrieving a discarded plurality of symbols; the retrieving system using the rule information obtained to configure the decoder; and the decoder retrieving the information concealed within the sequence of symbols by applying to the sequence of symbols at least one decoder rule determined by the configuration of the encoder.
13. A computer program product stored in a computer readable non-transitory medium for instructing a processor, which when executed by the processor causes the processor to perform a method for retrieving information concealed within a sequence of symbols, the method comprising the steps of: obtaining location information obtained using a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) from a retrieving system, the retrieving system comprising a physical network interface in communication with the internet and a decoder; obtaining rule information from the retrieving system from a location indicated by the location information, the rule information being indicative of a rule for retrieving a discarded plurality of symbols; configuring the decoder using the rule information obtained from the retrieving system; and retrieving the information concealed within the sequence of symbols by applying to the sequence of symbols at least one decoder rule determined by the configuration of the encoder.
