Method and system for analyzing risk
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention provides a method, system and computer program product for analyzing risks, for example associated with potential data leakage. Risk for activities may be measured as a function of risk components related to: persons involved in the activity; sensitivity of data at risk; endpoint receiving data at risk; and type the activity. Risk may account for the probability of a leakage event given an activity as well as a risk cost which reflects the above risk components. Manually and/or automatically tuned parameters may be used to affect the risk calculation. Risk associated with persons and/or files may be obtained by: initializing risk scores of persons or files based on a rule set; adjusting the risk scores in response to ongoing monitoring of events; identifying commonalities across persons or files; and propagating risk scores based on the commonalities.
