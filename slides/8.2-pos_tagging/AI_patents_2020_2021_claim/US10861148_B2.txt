<title>
Systems and methods for improved component inspection
</title>

<abstract>
A system includes a borescope and at least one processor. The borescope includes a camera configured to acquire an acquisition series of frames of at least one target component. The at least one processor is operably coupled to the camera, and is configured to acquire the acquisition series of frames from the camera; determine a blurriness metric value for each of the frames; select frames that satisfy a threshold for the blurriness metric value to form an inspection series of frames; and perform an inspection analysis for the at least one target component using the inspection series of frames.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: a borescope including a camera configured to acquire an acquisition series of frames of at least one target component; and at least one processor operably coupled to the camera, the at least one processor configured to: acquire the acquisition series of frames from the camera; determine a blurriness metric value for each of the frames using reference images including known corresponding blurred portions, wherein the at least one processor is configured to determine the blurriness metric value using a weighting based on at least one of type or location of blurring; select frames that satisfy a threshold for the blurriness metric value to form an inspection series of frames; and perform an inspection analysis for the at least one target component using the inspection series of frames.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is mounted on a wing of an aircraft, and the at least one target component includes blades of an aircraft engine.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is configured to use a cumulative metric for an entire predetermined image area for each frame.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the at least one processor is configured to generate a blurred frame for each acquired frame, compare the blurred frame to the corresponding acquired frame, and determine the blurriness metric value based on a similarity between the blurred frame and the corresponding acquired frame.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the at least one processor is configured to use a linear combination of blurriness filters to generate the blurred frame for each acquired frame.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the blurriness metric value is based on a degree of blurring.
7. A method comprising: acquiring, with a borescope including a camera, an acquisition series of frames of at least one target component; determining, with at least one processor, a blurriness metric value for each of the frames using reference images including known corresponding blurred portions, wherein determining the blurriness metric value includes using a weighting based on at least one of type or location of blurring; selecting frames that satisfy a threshold for the blurriness metric value to form an inspection series of frames; and performing an inspection analysis for the at least one target component using the inspection series of frames.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the at least one target component includes blades of an aircraft engine.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising mounting the borescope on a wing of an aircraft.
10. The method of claim 7, further comprising using a cumulative metric for an entire predetermined image area for each frame.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising generating a blurred frame for each acquired frame, comparing the blurred frame to the corresponding acquired frame, and determining the blurriness metric value based on a similarity between the blurred frame and the corresponding acquired frame.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising using a linear combination of blurriness filters to generate the blurred frame for each acquired frame.
13. The method of claim 7, wherein the blurriness metric value is based on a degree of blurring.
14. A tangible and non-transitory computer readable medium comprising one or more computer software modules configured to direct one or more processors to: acquire, with a borescope including a camera, an acquisition series of frames of at least one target component; determine a blurriness metric value for each of the frames using reference images including known corresponding blurred portions, wherein the one or more computer software modules are further configured to direct the one or more processors to determine the blurriness metric value using a weighting based on at least one of type or location of blurring; select frames that satisfy a threshold for the blurriness metric value to form an inspection series of frames; and perform an inspection analysis for the at least one target component using the inspection series of frames.
15. The tangible and non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 14, wherein the one or more computer software modules are further configured to direct the one or more processors to use a cumulative metric for an entire predetermined image area for each frame.
16. The tangible and non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, wherein the one or more computer software modules are further configured to direct the one or more processors to generate a blurred frame for each acquired frame, compare the blurred frame to the corresponding acquired frame, and determine the blurriness metric value based on a similarity between the blurred frame and the corresponding acquired frame.
17. The tangible and non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 14, wherein the one or more computer software modules are further configured to direct the one or more processors to determine the blurriness metric value based on a degree of blurring.
18. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is configured to acquire the acquisition series of frames until a desired number of acceptable frames have been identified using the threshold.
19. The method of claim 7, comprising acquiring the acquisition series of frames until a desired number of acceptable frames have been identified using the threshold.
20. The tangible and non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 14, wherein the one or more computer software modules are further configured to direct the one or more processors to acquire the acquisition series of frames until a desired number of acceptable frames have been identified using the threshold.
