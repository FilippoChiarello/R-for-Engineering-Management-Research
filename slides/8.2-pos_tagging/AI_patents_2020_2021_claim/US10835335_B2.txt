<title>
Cable failure detection
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for monitoring one or more cables of surgical tools are provided. The systems generally include a surgical tool with an end effector that has at least one function and a drive system that is operably coupled to the end effector and operably coupled to at least one motor. The drive system has at least one cable, and the drive system is configured to drive the at least one function on the end effector through actuation of the at least one cable. A control system is configured to actuate the at least one motor to drive the drive system and to preemptively detect failure of the at least one cable of the drive system.

<claims>
1. A robotic surgical system, comprising: an end effector assembly having a shaft with an end effector disposed at a proximal end thereof, the end effector having at least one function, the end effector having a torque sensor; a drive system operably coupled to the end effector assembly and operably coupled to at least one motor, the drive system having at least one cable, the drive system configured to drive the at least one function on the end effector through actuation of the at least one cable; and a control system configured to actuate the at least one motor to drive the drive system and thereby control actuation of the at least one function of the end effector, the control system configured to preemptively detect potential imminent failure of the at least one cable of the drive system; wherein the torque sensor is operably coupled with the at least one motor, the control system is configured to record force applied to the cable by the motor, calculate a derivative of force applied to the cable, alert a user if the derivative of force applied to the cable exceeds a predetermined threshold value, and set a second lower threshold value if the predetermined threshold value is exceeded.
2. The robotic surgical system of claim 1, wherein the threshold value is determined by recording a running average of the derivative of force.
3. The robotic surgical system of claim 1, wherein the end effector assembly includes a rotary encoder.
4. The robotic surgical system of claim 3, wherein the control system is configured to record a position of the cable, calculate a derivative of position of the cable, and alert a user if the derivative of position exceeds a threshold value.
5. The robotic surgical system of claim 1, wherein the at least one cable includes a sacrificial filament therein, the sacrificial filament being configured to fail at a lower force relative to remaining filaments in the at least one cable.
6. A surgical tool, comprising: a housing; an end effector assembly having a shaft with an end effector disposed at a proximal end thereof, the end effector having at least one function, the end effector assembly operationally engageable with the housing; a drive system operably coupled to the end effector assembly and operably coupled to at least one motor, the drive system having at least one cable, the drive system configured to drive the at least one function on the end effector through actuation of the at least one cable; and a control system disposed in the housing and in communication with the motor and one or more sensors in the surgical tool, the control system being configured to actuate the at least one motor to drive the drive system, the control system configured to monitor a status of the at least one cable based on data from the sensors; wherein the surgical tool has a first, normal mode of operation and a second, alert mode of operation, and the control system is configured to transition the surgical tool from the first mode to the second mode upon detecting an imminent failure of the at least one cable when monitoring the status of the cable based on the data from the sensors, and the second mode causes jaws on the end effector assembly to close and one or more wrist joints on the end effector assembly to align with a longitudinal axis of the end effector.
7. The surgical tool of claim 6, wherein the sensors include at least one of a torque sensor and a rotary encoder.
8. The surgical tool of claim 7, wherein the control system is configured to record at least one of a force on or a position of the cable, calculate a derivative value of the recorded value, and alert a user if the derivative value exceeds a predetermined threshold value.
9. The surgical tool of claim 8, wherein the predetermined threshold value is a multiple of a running average of the derivative value.
10. The surgical tool of claim 6, wherein the at least one cable includes a sacrificial filament therein, the sacrificial filament being configured to fail at a lower force relative to remaining filaments in the at least one cable.
11. The surgical tool of claim 6, wherein the end effector includes one of a stapler, a cutter, a grasper, or a suturing head.
12. The surgical tool of claim 6, wherein the at least one function of the end effector is articulation of the end effector.
13. A method comprising: inserting a surgical tool within a patient, the surgical tool having jaws and one or more wrist joints; operating a surgical tool under normal operating conditions, during which a control system of the surgical tool monitors an integrity indicator of one or more cables therein and alerts a user of an imminent cable failure of the one or more cables, wherein the surgical tool enters a safe mode of operation when the control system detects a potential for an imminent cable failure of the one or more cables in which the jaws on the surgical tool close and the one or more wrist joints on the surgical tool to align with a longitudinal axis of the surgical tool; and removing the surgical tool from the patient upon being alerted by the control system of an imminent cable failure of the one or more cables.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the control system monitors at least one of torque and rotation of one or more motors in the surgical tool using one or more sensors.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the control system calculates derivatives of at least one of force and position of the one or more cables based on values from the torque and rotation of the one or more motors, and detects when a current value of one or both of the derivatives of force and position exceeds a threshold value.
