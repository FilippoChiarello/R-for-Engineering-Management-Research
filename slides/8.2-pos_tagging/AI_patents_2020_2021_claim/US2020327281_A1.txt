WORD CLASSIFICATION BASED ON PHONETIC FEATURES
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for obtaining a textual term; determining, by one or more computers, a vector representing a phonetic feature of the textual term; comparing the vector representing the phonetic feature of the textual term with a reference vector representing a phonetic feature of a reference textual term; and classifying the textual term based on the comparing the vector with the reference vector.

The method of claim 1, wherein classifying the unknown textual term based on (i) a word-based model that representation of the one or more other textual terms that are surrounding the unknown textual term; and (ii) a classifier that compares the representation of the one or more phonetic features of the unknown textual term to each of a plurality of reference vectors in a vector space comprises: using the classifier to compare the representation of the one or more phonetic features of the unknown textual term to each of a plurality of reference vectors in a vector space only in response to determining that the word-based model cannot classify the unknown textual term.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein obtaining the unknown textual term comprises obtaining the unknown textual term from a resource stored at a remote computer.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein obtaining the unknown textual term comprises obtaining the unknown textual term from a search query.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the unknown term vector representing the phonetic feature of the unknown textual term comprises determining a pronunciation of the unknown textual term.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the unknown textual term includes a plurality of characters, wherein determining the unknown term vector representing the one or more phonetic features of the unknown textual term comprises determining a first vector representing a phonetic feature of a subset of the plurality of characters of the unknown textual term, wherein classifying the unknown textual term comprises: determining that the subset of the plurality of characters of the unknown textual term is similar to the reference textual term based on the comparing the first vector with the reference vector; and in response to determining that the subset of the plurality of characters of the unknown textual term is similar to the reference textual term, associating a definition of the reference textual term to the subset of the plurality of characters of the unknown textual term to create a classified textual term.
9. A computer-readable medium storing software having stored thereon instructions, which, when executed by one or more computers, cause the one or more computers to perform operations of: obtaining an unknown textual term and other terms surrounding the unknown textual term with N word positions of the unknown textual term, wherein the unknown textual term is a textual term that has an unknown dictionary definition, and N is a predetermined integer value; determining, by one or more computers, an unknown term vector representing (i) one or more phonetic features of the unknown textual term and (ii) the other terms surrounding the unknown textual term, including determining the unknown term vector using (i) the one or more phonetic features of the unknown textual term and (ii) the one or more other textual terms that are surrounding the unknown textual term; classifying the unknown textual term based on (i) a word-based model that uses the representation of the one or more other textual terms that are surrounding the unknown textual term to classify the unknown textual term; and (ii) a classifier that compares the representation of the one or more phonetic features of the unknown textual term to each of a plurality of reference vectors in a vector space, wherein each reference vector represents a reference textual term having a known definition.
