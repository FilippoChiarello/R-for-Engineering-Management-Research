</title>

<abstract>
The present invention provides a Gabor cube feature selection-based classification method for hyperspectral remote sensing images, comprising the following steps: generating three-dimensional Gabor filters according to set frequency and direction parameter values; convoluting hyperspectral remote sensing images with the three-dimensional Gabor filters to obtain three-dimensional Gabor features; selecting three-dimensional Gabor features, classification contribution degrees to various classes of which meet preset requirements, from the three-dimensional Gabor features; and classifying the hyperspectral remote sensing images by a multi-task joint sparse representation-based classification means by using the selected three-dimensional Gabor features. The present invention is based on the three-dimensional Gabor features, and the used three-dimensional Gabor features contain rich local change information of a signal and are competent in feature characterizing. Using a Fisher discriminant criterion not only makes full use of high-level semantics hidden among the features, but also eliminates redundant information and reduces the classification time complexity.
