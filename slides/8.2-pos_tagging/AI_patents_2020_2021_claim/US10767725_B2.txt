<title>
Amplitude-modulating vibrator for predictive maintenance modeling
</title>

<abstract>
A vibration device for generating various vibration signatures or characteristics is provided. This various vibration signatures or characteristics allow a single vibration device to be used to test and replicate failures in a subject device across a broad range of vibration signatures or characteristics transferring to the subject device. The vibration devices includes a pair of spaced-apart plates, each defining a slot therein. An adjustable fastener connects the upper and lower plates and extends through the upper and lower elongated slots. A vibrator is fastened to the upper plate via the upper elongated slot. To enable the vibration signatures or characteristics to be varied, the fastener is adjustable in a vertical direction to alter the distance between the lower plate and the upper plate, and is adjustable in a horizontal direction along the upper and lower slots. The motor can also translate along the upper elongated slot.

<claims>
1. A vibration device for generating various vibration signatures, the vibration device comprising: a lower plate having a lower elongated slot defined therein; an upper plate spaced from the lower plate by a distance and having an upper elongated slot defined therein; a fastener connecting the upper and lower plates and extending through the upper and lower elongated slots, wherein the fastener is adjustable in a vertical direction to alter the distance between the lower plate and the upper plate, and wherein the fastener is adjustable in a horizontal direction along the upper and lower slots; and a vibrator fastened to the upper plate via the upper elongated slot.
2. The vibration device of claim 1, wherein adjustment of at least one of the following alters the vibration signature of the vibration device: an adjustment of the vibrator along the upper elongated slot, an adjustment of the fastener in the vertical direction, and an adjustment of the fastener in the horizontal direction.
3. The vibration device of claim 1, further comprising an additional fastener configured to fasten the lower plate to a subject device such that the vibration signatures are transferred from the vibration device to the subject device.
4. The vibration device of claim 1, further comprising a spring extending between the lower plate and the upper plate.
5. The vibration device of claim 1, wherein the lower plate includes a second lower elongated slot, the upper plate includes a second upper elongated slot, and the vibration device further includes a second fastener extending through second lower elongated slot and second upper elongated slot and couples the lower plate to the upper plate.
6. The vibration device of claim 5, further comprising a second vibrator fastened to the upper plate via the second upper elongated slot.
7. The vibration device of claim 6, wherein the vibrator and the second vibrator each have an internal component configured to rotate in opposite directions from each other.
8. A system for supplying various vibration forces onto a subject device, the system comprising: a lower plate configured to mount to the subject device; an upper plate vertically spaced from the lower plate by a distance, the upper plate defining a pathway therein; an adjustable fastener connecting the lower plate to the upper plate, the adjustable fastener configured to alter the distance; and a vibrator connected to the pathway and configured to affix to the upper plate at various horizontal locations along the pathway; wherein at least one of an adjustment of the vibrator along the pathway and an adjustment of the fastener to alter the distance alters vibration forces supplied by the vibrator to the subject device.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the fastener is adjustable in a horizontal direction along the pathway to alter the vibration threes supplied by the vibrator to the subject device.
10. The system of claim 8, further comprising a spring extending between the lower plate and the upper plate.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the pathway includes a first slot, and Wherein the lower plate includes a second slot aligned with the first slot.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the adjustable fastener extends through the first and second slots, and wherein the adjustable fastener is adjustable in a vertical direction to alter the distance and is adjustable in a horizontal direction through the slots.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the upper plate defines a third slot and the lower plate defines a fourth slot aligned with the third slot.
14. The system of claim 13, further comprising a second adjustable fastener extending through the third and fourth slots and adjustable in the vertical and horizontal directions.
15. The system of claim 13, further comprising a second vibrator connected to the upper plate along the third slot.
16. A method for supplying various vibration forces onto a subject device, the method comprising: activating a vibrator secured to an upper plate that is secured to a lower plate through an adjustment mechanism to supply a first vibration signature to a subject device; adjusting the adjustment mechanism to alter a distance between the upper plate and the lower plate to move the vibrator to a second position relative to the subject device; and activating the vibrator to supply a second vibration signature to the subject device while the vibrator is affixed in the second position relative to the subject device.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the upper plate includes a track, and wherein the method further comprises activating the vibrator to supply a third vibration signature to the subject device while the adjustment mechanism is secured to the upper plate in a second location along the track.
18. The method of claim 16, wherein the adjusting of the adjustment mechanism includes rotating a screw or nut.
19. The method of claim 16, wherein the upper plate includes a track, and wherein the method further comprises activating the vibrator to supply a third vibration signature to the subject device while the vibrator is secured in a second location along the track.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein the track in the upper plate is an elongated slot defined by the upper plate.
