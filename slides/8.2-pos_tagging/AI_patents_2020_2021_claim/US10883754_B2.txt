<abstract>
A temperature controlled storage apparatus includes a plurality of lockable storage spaces. Each of the plurality of lockable storage spaces includes one or more compartments. The temperature of each of the one or more compartments is independently controllable to provide any one of a chilled temperature or a frozen temperature. Access to the storage space is remotely programmable.

2. A lockable temperature controlled storage apparatus, comprising: a) a group of compartments, each compartment closeable by a remotely programmable insulated lockable door; b) at least one common distribution system comprising a heat transfer fluid that is arranged to be in cooperation with a refrigeration system having a defined maximum refrigeration capacity, said at least one common distribution system comprising at least one valve for distributing the heat transfer fluid at a supplied pressure to exchange heat with the group of compartments; a controller for controlling actuation of the at least one valve, wherein the controller is configured to assign a cooling sequence to a sub-group of the compartments, the sub-group of compartments comprising two or more compartments and less than all of the compartments in the group of compartments, wherein the cooling sequence defines an order in which each compartment in the sub-group will receive heat transfer fluid such that the heat transfer fluid is periodically switched to each of the compartments in the sub-group in accordance with the cooling sequence by the controller actuating the at least one valve so that less than all of the compartments in the sub-group of compartments receive heat transfer fluid at any given time and to vary the quantity of heat transfer fluid to each of the compartments in the sub-group; wherein, when the temperature of one of the compartments in the sub-group has reached a defined desired range of temperature for the one compartment, a compartment that was previously not part of the sub-group is allocated into the sub-group.
3. A lockable temperature controlled storage apparatus, comprising: a) a group of compartments, each compartment closeable by a remotely programmable insulated lockable door; b) at least one common distribution system comprising a heat transfer fluid that is arranged to be in cooperation with a refrigeration system having a defined maximum refrigeration capacity, said at least one common distribution system comprising at least one valve for distributing the heat transfer fluid at a supplied pressure to exchange heat with the group of compartments; a controller for controlling actuation of the at least one valve, wherein the controller is configured to assign a cooling sequence to a sub-group of the compartments, the sub-group of compartments comprising two or more compartments and less than all of the compartments in the group of compartments, wherein the cooling sequence defines an order in which each compartment in the sub-group will receive heat transfer fluid such that the heat transfer fluid is periodically switched to each of the compartments in the sub-group in accordance with the cooling sequence by the controller actuating the at least one valve so that less than all of the compartments in the sub-group of compartments receive heat transfer fluid at any given time and to vary the quantity of heat transfer fluid to each of the compartments in the sub-group; wherein the selection of the compartments in the sub-group are prioritised according to criteria, in which the criteria prioritise compartments based on: i) having a temperature outside a defined desired range of temperature and/or ii) temperature requirements of the compartments; wherein the temperature requirement of a compartment is based on the compartment having one of the following (a) a controlled ambient temperature having a temperature range between substantially 4° C. to substantially 21° C.; or (b) a chilled temperature; or (c) a frozen temperature.
4. A lockable temperature controlled storage apparatus, comprising: a) a group of compartments, each compartment closeable by a remotely programmable insulated lockable door; b) at least one common distribution system comprising a heat transfer fluid that is arranged to be in cooperation with a refrigeration system having a defined maximum refrigeration capacity, said at least one common distribution system comprising at least one valve for distributing the heat transfer fluid at a supplied pressure to exchange heat with the group of compartments; a controller for controlling actuation of the at least one valve, wherein the controller is configured to assign a cooling sequence to a sub-group of the compartments, the sub-group of compartments comprising two or more compartments and less than all of the compartments in the group of compartments, wherein the cooling sequence defines an order in which each compartment in the sub-group will receive heat transfer fluid such that the heat transfer fluid is periodically switched to each of the compartments in the sub-group in accordance with the cooling sequence by the controller actuating the at least one valve so that less than all of the compartments in the sub-group of compartments receive heat transfer fluid at any given time and to vary the quantity of heat transfer fluid to each of the compartments in the sub-group; wherein the controller is configured to determine, for each compartment, a required refrigeration capacity to maintain or return the compartment to a defined desired range of temperature associated with the compartment, and the controller allocates a number of compartments into the sub-group such that the maximum refrigeration capacity is not exceeded by a combined required refrigeration capacity of the number of compartments such that a refrigerant pressure for cooling is maintained for each compartment in the sub-group.
5. The lockable temperature controlled storage apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the controller is configured to place in a queue each compartment of the group that is (i) not allocated to the sub-group and (ii) has a temperature outside the defined desired range of temperature associated with the compartment, wherein each compartment in the queue is prioritised in the queue based on its waiting time in the queue and/or its differential temperature, wherein the differential temperature of each compartment is the temperature difference between the temperature of the compartment and the defined desired range of temperature for the compartment.
6. The lockable temperature controlled storage apparatus of claim 5, wherein said compartment having a longest waiting time in the queue is prioritised highest in the queue.
7. The lockable temperature controlled storage apparatus of claim 5, wherein said compartment having the temperature differential that is largest is prioritised highest in the queue.
8. The lockable temperature controlled storage apparatus of claim 4, wherein the at least one valve comprises multiple valves and the controller is arranged to determine the available refrigeration capacity of the refrigeration system by determining the status of said multiple valves.
