A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ASSESSING THE MOBILITY OF A SUBJECT
</title>

<abstract>
According to an aspect, there is provided an apparatus (2) for assessing the mobility of a subject, the apparatus (2) comprising a processing unit (4) that is configured to obtain measurements of the movements of the subject over time; process the obtained measurements of the movements to determine values for a first plurality of parameters; and combine the determined values for the first plurality of parameters to determine an estimate of the time that the subject would take to complete a timed up-and-go, TUG, test.

<claims>
1. An apparatus for assessing the mobility of a subject, the apparatus comprising a processing unit that is configured to: obtain measurements of movements of the subject over time, wherein the measurements of movements are for a period of time during activities of daily living of the subject in which the subject does not perform a timed up-and-go, TUG test; process the obtained measurements to determine values for a first plurality of parameters, wherein each of the parameters in the first plurality of parameters relates to any one or more of walking, sit-to-stand transitions, stand-to-sit transitions, walking on stairs, physical activity levels, sedentary periods, the environment in which the subject is walking or moving, walking on a particular type of terrain or ground, whether the subject is walking with or without shoes or with or without a walking aid and localisation data; and combine the determined values for the first plurality of parameters using a model to determine an estimate of the time that the subject would take to complete a timed up and go, TUG, test, wherein the model relates values for the first plurality of parameters to values for the time taken to complete a TUG test.

4. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processing unit is further configured to determine the model by: obtaining measurements of the movements of a plurality of people over time; obtaining measurements of the times taken for the plurality of people to complete the TUG test; processing the obtained measurements of the movements of the plurality of people and obtained measurements of the times taken for the plurality of people to complete the TUG test to determine values for a second plurality of parameters; evaluating the values for the second plurality of parameters to identify a first subset of the second plurality of parameters that are statistically dependent on the obtained measurements of the times taken for the plurality of people to complete the TUG test, wherein the first subset of the second plurality of parameters is the first plurality of parameters; and deriving the model for determining an estimate of the time that a subject would take to complete the TUG test based on the first subset of the second plurality of parameters.
5. An apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein the processing unit is further configured to evaluate the values for the second plurality of parameters by: determining a first measure of statistical dependence for each of the parameters in the second plurality of parameters based on a measure of association between the values for each of the second plurality of parameters and the time taken for the plurality of people to complete the TUG test; and selecting the first subset of the second plurality of parameters as (i) the parameters having a measure of statistical dependence above a threshold value; or (ii) a predetermined number of parameters having the highest measures of statistical dependence.
6. An apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein the processing unit is further configured to evaluate the values for the second plurality of parameters by: determining a first measure of statistical dependence for each of the parameters in the second plurality of parameters based on a statistical dependence between the values for each of the second plurality of parameters and the time taken for the plurality of people to complete the TUG test; selecting a second subset of the second plurality of parameters as the parameters having a first measure of statistical dependence above a first threshold value; determining a second measure of statistical dependence for each of the parameters in the second subset of the second plurality of parameters based on a measure of association between the values for each of parameters in the second subset of the second plurality of parameters with each of the other parameters in the second subset of the second plurality of parameters; for any pair of parameters in the second subset of the second plurality of parameters having a second measure of statistical dependence above a second threshold value, discarding from the second subset the one of the pair of parameters having the lowest first measure of statistical dependence; and forming the first subset of the second plurality of parameters based on the remaining ones of the second subset of the second plurality of parameters.

8. A system for assessing the mobility of a subject, the system comprising: a sensor unit comprising one or more sensors for measuring movements of the subject over time, wherein the sensor unit is configured to generate a sensor signal based on said measured movements of the subject over time; and an apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processing unit is configured to obtain the measurements of the movements of the subject by receiving the sensor signal from the sensor unit.
9. A method of assessing the mobility of a subject, the method in a processing unit comprising: obtaining measurements of the movements of the subject over time, wherein the measurements of movements are for a period of time during activities of daily living of the subject in which the subject does not perform a timed up-and-go, TUG test; processing the obtained measurements of the movements to determine values for a first plurality of parameters, wherein each of the parameters in the first plurality of parameters relates to any one or more of walking, sit-to-stand transitions, stand-to-sit transitions, walking on stairs, physical activity levels, sedentary periods, the environment in which the subject is walking or moving, walking on a particular type of terrain or ground, whether the subject is walking with or without shoes or with or without a walking aid and localisation data; and combining the determined values for the first plurality of parameters using a model to determine an estimate of the time that the subject would take to complete a timed up and go, TUG test, wherein the model relates values for the first plurality of parameters to values for the time taken to complete a TUG test.
