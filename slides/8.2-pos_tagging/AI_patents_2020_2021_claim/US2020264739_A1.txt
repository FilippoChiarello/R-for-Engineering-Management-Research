<title>
LOCATION-BASED HEALTHCARE COLLABORATION, DATA MANAGEMENT AND ACCESS CONTROL
</title>

<abstract>
The locations of electronic devices in an institutional facility are determined based on interaction with the wireless mobile devices of users who roam though the facility and interact with (or are detected by) the devices.

<claims>
1. 1.-12. (canceled)
13. A method of tracking and updating the location of a movable electronic device that includes a wireless interface for interaction with portable wireless mobile devices of users, the method comprising: authenticating a user for access, via the movable electronic device, to restricted data consistent with a security policy and a privilege level of the user, via an authentication sequence comprising: obtaining an authentication credential of the user, via the wireless interface, from a portable wireless mobile device of the user, transmitting the authentication credential from the movable electronic device to an authentication server for verification of the authentication credential, and when the authentication credential is verified, granting access, for the user, to the restricted data; and during the authentication sequence, (i) interrogating the portable wireless device of the user, via the wireless interface, for local GPS coordinates of the portable wireless mobile device, and (ii) electronically communicating the local GPS coordinates to a location server as a location of the movable electronic device.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the authentication credential comprises a biometric indicium.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein the wireless interface implements a short-range wireless protocol, thereby ensuring co-location of the portable wireless mobile device and the movable electronic device.
16. The method of claim 13, wherein the movable electronic device is configured to wake up when the portable wireless mobile device enters a communication range of the movable electronic device.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the communication range is an NFC range.
18. The method of claim 13, wherein the movable electronic device comprises a display.
19. The method of claim 13, wherein the movable electronic device is incapable of receiving GPS signals.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein the movable electronic device lacks a GPS chipset.
21. The method of claim 13, wherein the authentication sequence is executed upon occurrence of a proximity event when the portable wireless mobile device is moved into proximity to the movable electronic device.
22. The method of claim 13, wherein the portable wireless device is interrogated for the local GPS coordinates only when an update interval has elapsed.
23. The method of claim 22, wherein the update interval corresponds to a fixed amount of time.
24. The method of claim 22, wherein the update interval corresponds to an adaptive time period based on a frequency with which the location of the movable electronic device changes.
25. The method of claim 13, wherein the portable wireless device is interrogated for the local GPS coordinates only when instructions to do so have been received by the movable electronic device.
26. The method of claim 25, wherein the instructions are received from the location server.
27. A method of tracking and updating the location of a movable electronic device that includes a wireless interface for interaction with portable wireless mobile devices of users, the method comprising: establishing an update interval for the movable electronic device; and only when the update interval has elapsed, (i) opportunistically interrogating a portable wireless device of a user, via the wireless interface, for local GPS coordinates of the portable wireless mobile device only upon occurrence of a proximity event when the portable wireless mobile device is moved into proximity with the mobile electronic device, and (ii) electronically communicating the local GPS coordinates to a location server as a location of the movable electronic device.
28. The method of claim 27, wherein the portable wireless device is interrogated for the local GPS coordinates only when instructions to do so have been received by the movable electronic device.
29. The method of claim 28, wherein the instructions are received from the location server.
30. The method of claim 27, wherein the update interval corresponds to a fixed amount of time.
31. The method of claim 27, wherein the update interval corresponds to an adaptive time period based on a frequency with which the location of the movable electronic device changes.
32. The method of claim 27, wherein the wireless interface implements a short-range wireless protocol, thereby ensuring co-location of the portable wireless mobile device and the movable electronic device.
33. The method of claim 27, wherein the movable electronic device is configured to wake up when the portable wireless mobile device enters a communication range of the movable electronic device.
34. The method of claim 33, wherein the communication range is an NFC range.
35. The method of claim 27, wherein the movable electronic device comprises a display.
36. The method of claim 27, wherein the movable electronic device is incapable of receiving GPS signals.
37. The method of claim 36, wherein the movable electronic device lacks a GPS chipset.
