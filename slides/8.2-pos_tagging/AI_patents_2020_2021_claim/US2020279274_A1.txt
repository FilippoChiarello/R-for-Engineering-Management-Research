ONLINE APPLICATION ORIGINATION (OAO) SERVICE FOR FRAUD PREVENTION SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
A fraud prevention system that includes a client server and a fraud prevention server. The fraud prevention server includes an electronic processor and a memory. The memory includes an online application origination (OAO) service. When executing the OAO service, the electronic processor is configured to determine a fraud score of an online application based on an online application origination (OAO) model that differentiates between a behavior of a normal user and a behavior of a nefarious actor during a submission of the online application on a device, and control the client server to approve, hold, or deny the online application based on the fraud score that is determined.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A fraud prevention system comprising: a fraud prevention server including an electronic processor and a memory, the memory including an online application origination (OAO) service, wherein, when executing the OAO service, the electronic processor is configured to determine a fraud score of an online application based on an online application origination (OAO) model that differentiates between a behavior of a normal user and a behavior of a nefarious actor during a submission of the online application on a device, and control the client server to approve, hold, or deny the online application based on the fraud score that is determined.
2. The fraud prevention system of claim 1, wherein the OAO model includes a feature set with behavioral features.
3. The fraud prevention system of claim 2, wherein the behavioral features includes mouse movement behavioral features, and wherein the mouse movement behavioral features include a standard deviation of a mouse click in a X direction feature.
4. The fraud prevention system of claim 2, wherein the behavioral features includes navigation behavioral features, and wherein the navigation behavioral features further include a time from last key to submission feature.
5. The fraud prevention system of claim 2, wherein the behavioral features includes navigation behavioral features, and wherein the navigation behavioral features further include a coefficient of variation of keystroke rate across all fields in a form of the online application feature.
6. The fraud prevention system of claim 2, wherein the behavioral features includes mouse movement behavioral features, and wherein the mouse movement behavioral features further include a standard deviation of a mouse click in a Y direction feature.
7. The fraud prevention system of claim 2, wherein the behavioral features includes navigation behavioral features, and wherein the navigation behavioral features further include an average number of mouse clicks per field of the form feature.
8. The fraud prevention system of claim 2, wherein the behavioral features includes navigation behavioral features, and wherein the navigation behavioral features further include an amount of time on page feature.
9. The fraud prevention system of claim 2, wherein the behavioral features includes mouse movement behavioral features, and wherein the mouse movement behavioral features further include a total mouse distance feature.
10. The fraud prevention system of claim 2, wherein the behavioral features includes navigation behavioral features, and wherein the navigation behavioral features further include a ratio of time spent in fields of the form to the overall time on page feature.
11. The fraud prevention system of claim 2, wherein the behavioral features includes navigation behavioral features, and wherein the navigation behavioral features further include an average keystroke rate standard deviation feature.
12. The fraud prevention system of claim 2, wherein the behavioral features includes navigation behavioral features, and wherein the navigation behavioral features further include an average of time between focus and first keystroke feature.
13. The fraud prevention system of claim 2, wherein the behavioral features includes navigation behavioral features, and wherein the navigation behavioral features further include a total mouse click count feature.
14. The fraud prevention system of claim 2, wherein the feature set further includes non-behavioral features.
15. The fraud prevention system of claim 14, wherein the non-behavioral features further include a proxy concealed detection feature.
16. A method for operating a fraud prevention system, the method comprising: determining, with an online application origination (OAO) service on a fraud prevention server, a fraud score of an online application based on an online application origination (OAO) model that differentiates between a behavior of a normal user and a behavior of a nefarious actor during a submission of the online application on a device; and controlling, with the fraud prevention server, a client server to approve, hold, or deny the online application based on the fraud score that is determined.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the OAO model includes a feature set with behavioral features.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the behavioral features includes mouse movement behavioral features, and wherein the mouse movement behavioral features include a standard deviation of a mouse click in a X direction feature.
19. The method of claim 17, wherein the feature set further includes non-behavioral features.
20. A non-transitory computer-readable medium comprising instructions that, when executed by a fraud prevention server, cause the fraud prevention server to perform a set of operations comprising: determining, with an online application origination (OAO) service, a fraud score of an online application based on an online application origination (OAO) model that differentiates between a behavior of a normal user and a behavior of a nefarious actor during a submission of the online application on a device; and controlling a client server to approve, hold, or deny the online application based on the fraud score that is determined.
