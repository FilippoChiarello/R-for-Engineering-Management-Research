INTRATUMORAL TFR CELLS CURTAIL ANTI-PD-1 TREATMENT EFFICACY
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention includes methods of detecting follicular regulatory T cells (TFR) comprising: obtaining a biological sample from a subject and detecting whether TFR are increased in the tumor sample by contacting the biological sample with antibodies that detect CD3+CD4+ FOXP3+BCL6+ T cells CD3+CD4+CXCR5+GITR+ T cells, or both, when compared to a healthy subject, and detecting the increase of TFR in the tumor sample. The present invention also includes combination therapy that depletes follicular regulatory T cells (TFR) with minimal effect on regulatory T cells (TREGS) to prevent or reduce immune related adverse effects (irAEs).
