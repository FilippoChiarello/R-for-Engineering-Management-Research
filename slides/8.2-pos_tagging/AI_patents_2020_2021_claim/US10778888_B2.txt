<title>
Automatic selection of a camera based on facial detection
</title>

<abstract>
A camera selection system and method for automatically selecting an appropriate camera to use for capturing photos and videos is provided. The method includes the steps of detecting that a camera application has been opened, activating a first camera and a second camera of the mobile device, analyzing a feed received from the first camera and a feed received from the second camera to detect whether a face is present in a field of view of the first camera or the second camera, determining that the user intends to use the first camera based on a detection of the face in the field of view of the first camera, deactivating the second camera in response to the determining and displaying the feed received from the first camera on the main display of the mobile device for viewing by the user while using the camera application.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: analyzing, by a processor of a computing system, a feed received from a first camera and a feed received from a second camera of a mobile device of a user to detect whether a face is present in a field of view of the first camera or the second camera, in response to a camera application being opened; and determining, by the processor, that another user other than the user is operating the mobile device to take a standard photograph of the user if an identity of the user is not confirmed when the face is present in the field of view of the first camera, wherein in response to the determining: deactivating, by the processor, the second camera, and displaying, by the processor, the feed received from the first camera on the main display of the mobile device for viewing by the user while using the camera application.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the identity of the user is confirmed by identifying, by the processor, the face is that of the user, using facial recognition software loaded on the computing system.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the second camera is a selected as a default if the face is not detected in the field of view of the first camera.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein a detection of the face in the field of view of the first camera requires the face to be within a predetermined proximity to the first camera.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the analyzing of the feed received from the first camera is performed prior to the analyzing of the feed received from the second camera, to detect whether the face is present in the field of view of the first camera.
6. A computer system, comprising: a processor; a memory device coupled to the processor; and a computer readable storage device coupled to the processor, wherein the storage device contains program code executable by the processor via the memory device to implement a method for automatically selecting an appropriate camera to use for capturing photos and videos, the method comprising: analyzing, by a processor of a computing system, a teed received from a first camera and a feed received from a second camera of a mobile device of a user to detect whether a face is present in a field of view of the first camera or the second camera, in response to a camera application being opened; and determining, by the processor, that another user other than the user is operating the mobile device to take a standard photograph of the user if an identity of the user is not confirmed when the face is present in the field of view of the first camera, wherein in response to the determining: deactivating, by the processor, the second camera, and displaying, by the processor, the feed received from the first camera on the main display of the mobile device for viewing by the user while using the camera application.
7. The computer system of claim 6, wherein the identity of the user is confirmed by identifying, by the processor, the face is that of the user, using facial recognition software loaded on the computing system.
8. The computer system of claim 6, wherein the second camera is a selected as a default if the face is not detected in the field of view of the first camera.
9. The computer system of claim 6, wherein a detection of the face in the field of view of the first camera requires the face to be within a predetermined proximity to the first camera.
10. The computer system of claim 6, wherein the analyzing of the feed received from the first camera is performed prior to the analyzing of the feed received from the second camera, to detect whether the face is present in the field of view of the first camera.
11. A computer program product, comprising a computer readable hardware storage device storing a computer readable program code, the computer readable program code comprising an algorithm that when executed by a computer processor of a computing system implements a method for automatically selecting an appropriate camera to use for capturing photos and videos, comprising: analyzing, by a processor of a computing system, a feed received from a first camera and a feed received from a second camera of a mobile device of a user to detect whether a face is present in a field of view of the first camera or the second camera, in response to a camera application being opened; and determining, by the processor, that another user other than the user is operatingthe mobile device to take a standard photograph of the user if an identity of the user is not confirmed when the face is present in the field of view of the first camera, wherein in response to the determining: deactivating, by the processor; the second camera, and displaying; by the processor, the feed received from the first camera on the main display of the mobile device for viewing by the user while using the camera application.
12. The computer program product of claim 11, wherein the identity of the user is confirmed by identifying, by the processor, the face is that of the user, using facial recognition software loaded on the computing system.
13. The computer program product of claim 11; wherein the second camera is a selected as a default if the face is not detected in the field of view of the first camera.
14. The computer program product of claim 11, wherein a detection of the face in the field of view of the first camera requires the face to be within a predetermined proximity to the first camera.
15. The computer program product of claim 11, wherein the analyzing of the feed received from the first camera is performed prior to the analyzing of the feed received from the second camera, to detect whether the face is present in the field of view of the first camera.
