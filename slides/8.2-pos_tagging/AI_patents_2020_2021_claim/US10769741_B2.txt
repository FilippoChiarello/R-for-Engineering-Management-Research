<title>
Emergency response augmented reality-based notification
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the invention leverage mobile proliferation to enable laypersons to initiate a timely and effective emergency response in case of an emergency, such as a medical emergency, e.g. cardiac event. Mobile apps are made available as part of an organization's overall response plan and program, allowing bystanders of emergency events to easily initiate notifications, for example to trained responders, for example in their facility, in a timely manner commensurate with the type of emergency specific to their facility. More particularly, embodiments of the invention use mobile applications to provide augmented reality-based alerts and notifications, for example to certified first trainees to respond to the scene of the emergency.
