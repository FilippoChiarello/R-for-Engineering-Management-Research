ADAPTATION IN TRANSMITTER DEVICES AND RADIO FREQUENCY RECEIVER AND METHOD OF TEMPORARY DATA CRYPTOGRAPHY FOR SYNCHRONY COMPARISON
</title>

<abstract>
In order to achieve a secure and inviolable encryption method of data to be transmitted via RF. To this end, a transmitting device (TD) and a receiving device (RD) each receive a high-precision real-time clock (RTC). The receiving device (RD) receives the registration of the transmitting devices (TD) through specific commands, opening a recording window in its firmware for the registration of a transmitting device (TD), performing automatic comparison of the difference between the received data—date, time, etc.—of this transmitting device (TD) with the data of its own RTC, storing it in the memory of the microprocessor (M) together with the serial number of the transmitting device (TD) compared. When the transmitting device (TD) is triggered to perform an action, the microprocessor (M) reads its RTC and encrypts the date and time data (D) (year, month, day, hour, minute, second) in single binary code, this being transmitted to the receiving device (RD), which microprocessor M performs the decoding of data D and compares it with the date and time (D data) of its own RTC by performing or canceling the action of the transmitting device (TD).

<claims>
1. - Adaptation on transmitters and receivers of radiofrequencies, consisting of a transmitting device (TD) equipped with a RF transmitter (T) and a receiver (RD) provided with an RF receiver (R), both (TD and RD) containing a microprocessor (M) with firmware and logic programming (P) of 84 bits with coding chosen by a control center, characterized by the devices (TD and RD) receive a high precision real time clock (RTC) each.
2. - Time data encryption method for synchronisation comparison, according to the adapted devices (TD and RD) described in claim 1, after installed in their respective devices characterized by the receiving device (RD) receive registration of new transmitter controls—transmitting devices (TD)—manually by specific buttons and/or controls, opening a recording window in its firmware for the registration of a transmitting device (TD), automatically comparing the difference between the received data—date, time, etc.—of this transmitting device (TD) with their own RTC data, this time difference between both (TD and RD) stored in the microprocessor memory (M) of the receiving device (RD) together with the serial number of the transmitting device (TD) compared.
3. - Method of time data encryption for synchronization comparison, according to claim 1, when the transmitting device (TD) is enabled to execute a command, characterized by its microprocessor (M) perform the reading of its RTC and, from the logical programming (P), encrypt the data (D) of the time and date of the action for its transmission together with its serial number through the RF transmitter (T) to the RF receiver (R) of the receiving device (RD), which microprocessor (M) recognizes the serial number and decodes the encrypted data (D) for comparison with the data (D) of its own RTC.
4. - Method of time data encryption for synchronization comparison, according to claim 1, when employed the method in devices with PKES system for vehicles, characterized by the receiving device (RD) installed in the vehicle emits an alarm signal together with the vehicle ID via LF radiofrequency, initiating an internal oscillator timed count waiting for a response from the transmitting (TD) device that "awakens" and verifies the ID, by querying your RTC and sending this data along with your serial number via UHF so that the receiving device (RD) of the vehicle pauses the count and compare the data received with its own RTC, allowing to perform the action in case of agreement of the data.
