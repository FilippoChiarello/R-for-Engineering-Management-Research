METHOD OF OPERATING UE IN RELATION TO SIDELINK COMMUNICATION AND FEEDBACK IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Provided is a method of operating a transmitting user equipment (UE) in a wireless communication system. The method includes receiving a first radio resource control (RRC) configuration-related message by the transmitting UE (Tx UE), and transmitting a message to a receiving UE by the Tx UE. The first RRC configuration-related message includes sidelink hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) enable or HARQ disable configuration information.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of operating a transmitting user equipment (Tx UE) in a wireless communication system, the method comprising: receiving, by the Tx UE, a first radio resource control (RRC) configuration-related message; and transmitting, by the Tx UE, a message to a receiving UE (Rx UE) by the Tx UE, wherein the first RRC configuration-related message includes sidelink hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) enable or HARQ disable configuration information.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein upon receipt of the first RRC configuration-related message, the Tx UE transmits a second RRC configuration-related message to the Rx UE, and wherein the second RRC configuration-related message includes the sidelink HARQ enable or HARQ disable configuration information.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein whether the Rx UE transmits an HARQ acknowledgment/negative acknowledgment (ACK/NACK) for the message is determined based on the second RRC configuration-related message.
4. The method according to claim 2, wherein based on the second RRC configuration-related message indicating HARQ enable, the Tx UE receives an HARQ ACK/NACK for the message from the Rx UE.
5. The method according to claim 2, wherein based on the second RRC configuration-related message indicating HARQ disable, the Tx UE does not receive an HARQ ACK/NACK for the message from the Rx UE.
6. A method of operating a receiving user equipment (UE) in a wireless communication system, the method comprising: receiving a message from a transmitting UE (Tx UE) which has received a first radio resource control (RRC) configuration-related message by the Rx UE, wherein the first RRC configuration-related message includes sidelink hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) enable or HARQ disable configuration information.
7. The method according to claim 6, wherein the Rx UE receives a second RRC configuration-related message from the Tx UE which has received the first RRC configuration-related message, and wherein the second RRC configuration-related message includes the sidelink HARQ enable or HARQ disable configuration information.
8. The method according to claim 7, wherein whether the Rx UE transmits an HARQ acknowledgment/negative acknowledgment (ACK/NACK) for the message is determined based on the second RRC configuration-related message.
9. The method according to claim 7, wherein based on the second RRC configuration-related message indicating HARQ enable, the Rx UE transmits an HARQ ACK/NACK for the message.
10. The method according to claim 7, wherein based on the second RRC configuration-related message indicating HARQ disable, the Rx UE does not transmit an HARQ ACK/NACK for the message.
11. The method according to claim 1, wherein the Tx UE and the Rx UE communicate with at least one of another UE, a UE related to an autonomous driving vehicle, a base station, or a network.
12. A transmitting user equipment (UE) in a wireless communication system, the transmitting UE (Tx UE) comprising: at least one processor; and at least one computer memory operatively coupled to the at least one processor and storing instructions which, when executed, cause the at least one processor to perform operations, wherein the operations include receiving a first radio resource control (RRC) configuration-related message by the Tx UE, and transmitting a message to a receiving UE by the Tx UE, and wherein the first RRC configuration-related message includes sidelink hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) enable or HARQ disable configuration information.
