<title>
Driving assistance apparatus, driving assistance system, and driving assistance method
</title>

<abstract>
A driving assistance apparatus includes a memory and a processor having hardware. The processor is configured to acquire behavior prediction information of a moving object within a predetermined range centered on a subject vehicle to which driving assistance is applied, predict behavior content of the moving object within the predetermined range based on the acquired behavior prediction information of the moving object, and output a notification of an alert level corresponding to the predicted behavior content of the moving object at an edge of a windshield corresponding to a side on which the moving object, the behavior content of which has been predicted, exists, with respect to the position of a driver.

<claims>
1. A driving assistance apparatus comprising: a memory; and a processor having hardware, wherein the processor is configured to: acquire behavior prediction information of a moving object within a predetermined range centered on a subject vehicle to which driving assistance is applied; predict behavior content of the moving object within the predetermined range based on the acquired behavior prediction information of the moving object; and output a notification of an alert level corresponding to the predicted behavior content of the moving object at an edge of a windshield corresponding to a side on which the moving object, the behavior content of which has been predicted, exists, with respect to a position of a driver.
2. The driving assistance apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to output the notification of the alert level that is determined to correspond to the predicted behavior content of the moving object and behavior prediction information of the subject vehicle.
3. The driving assistance apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the behavior prediction information includes a combination of one or more of (i) predicted route information and (ii) priority setting information at a time when the subject vehicle merges into another lane, along with position information of the subject vehicle.
4. The driving assistance apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the behavior prediction information includes information acquired via an external network including a mobile phone network, and/or information acquired via inter-vehicle communication, road-to-vehicle communication, and a sensor of the subject vehicle.
5. The driving assistance apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to, when there is a moving object hidden by another moving object among moving objects within the predetermined range, exclude the hidden moving object from the moving objects to be predicted.
6. The driving assistance apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to output, at a lower edge of the windshield, the notification on the moving object visible through the windshield.
7. The driving assistance apparatus according to claim 6, wherein the processor is configured to output, at a left edge and a right edge of the windshield, the notification on hidden moving objects on a left side and a right side of the windshield, respectively.
8. The driving assistance apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to output, at a left edge and a right edge of the windshield, the notification on hidden moving objects on a left side and a right side of the windshield, respectively.
9. The driving assistance apparatus according to claim 6, wherein the processor is configured to output a notification on the moving object behind the subject vehicle at an upper edge of the windshield.
10. The driving assistance apparatus according to claim 6, wherein the notification output at the edge of the windshield is output with a width corresponding to a size of the moving object.
11. The driving assistance apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to output the notification of the alert level by emitting light in a manner of changing a color element of the light and/or a blinking interval of the light.
12. The driving assistance apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to output a specific notification that distinguishes a moving object of which the behavior prediction information is acquired from a moving object of which the behavior prediction information is not acquired, within the predetermined range.
13. A driving assistance system comprising: the driving assistance apparatus according to claim 1; a mobile terminal carried by a pedestrian; and a central server in a cloud, wherein: the driving assistance apparatus is mounted on a vehicle; and the central server is configured to communicably connect the driving assistance apparatus and the mobile terminal, collect behavior prediction information from the driving assistance apparatus and the mobile terminal, and notify the driving assistance apparatus of the behavior prediction information.
14. A driving assistance method executed by a driving assistance apparatus, the method comprising: reading out, from a memory, behavior prediction information of a moving object within a predetermined range centered on a subject vehicle to which driving assistance is applied predicting behavior content of the moving object within the predetermined range based on the read-out behavior prediction information of the moving object; and outputting a notification of an alert level corresponding to the predicted behavior content of the moving object at an edge of a windshield corresponding to a side on which the moving object, the behavior content of which has been predicted, exits, with respect to the position of a driver.
15. The driving assistance method according to claim 14, further comprising: outputting the notification of the alert level that is determined to correspond to the predicted behavior content of the moving object and behavior prediction information of the subject vehicle.
