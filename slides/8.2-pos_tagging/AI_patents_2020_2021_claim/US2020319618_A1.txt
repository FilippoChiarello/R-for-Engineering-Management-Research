EVALUATION WORK PIECE, NON-TRANSITORY COMPUTER READABLE MEDIUM RECORDING A MACHINING PROGRAM AND NON-TRANSITORY COMPUTER READABLE MEDIUM RECORDING A DATA STRUCTURE
</title>

<abstract>
An evaluation work piece which is machined with a multi-axis machine tool that includes three linear axes and one or more rotary axes includes: at least one of a curved surface portion in which the inclination of a tool is changed, a boundary portion of two regions of a flat surface which is machined at different angles of the tool and which includes the two adjacent regions and a corner portion in which the amount of movement of the rotary axis is larger than the amount of movement of a tool tip point. The curved surface portion is preferably formed to be a free curved surface. Preferably, the evaluation work piece includes: a stage-shaped machined portion; and a twisted machined portion which is formed on the stage-shaped machined portion, the boundary portion is formed in the front surface of the stage-shaped machined portion and the curved surface portion and the corner portion are formed in the twisted machined portion.

<claims>
1. An evaluation work piece which is machined with a multi-axis machine tool that includes three linear axes and one or more rotary axes, the evaluation work piece comprising: at least one of a curved surface portion in which an inclination of a tool is changed, a boundary portion of two regions of a flat surface which is machined at different angles of the tool and which includes the two adjacent regions and a corner portion in which an amount of movement of the rotary axis is larger than an amount of movement of a tool tip point.
2. The evaluation work piece according to claim 1, wherein the curved surface portion is formed to be a free curved surface.
3. The evaluation work piece according to claim 1, comprising: a stage-shaped machined portion; and a twisted machined portion which is formed on the stage-shaped machined portion, wherein the boundary portion is formed in a front surface of the stage-shaped machined portion, and the curved surface portion and the corner portion are formed in the twisted machined portion.
4. The evaluation work piece according to claim 1, wherein the multi-axis machine tool is a machine tool of a table rotation type in which a table is linearly moved and is rotationally moved, a machine tool of a mixed type in which a table is linearly moved and in which a head is rotationally moved or a machine tool of a head rotation type in which a head is linearly moved and is rotationally moved.
5. A non-transitory computer readable recording medium recording a machining program for instructing a computer serving as a numerical controller which drives a multi-axis machine tool that includes three linear axes and one or more rotary axes so as to produce an evaluation work piece to execute at least one of processing in which an inclination of a tool is changed so as to form a free curved surface, processing in which in a boundary portion of two adjacent regions of a flat surface, machining is performed at different angles of the tool between the two regions and processing in which an amount of movement of the rotary axis of the tool is set larger than an amount of movement of a tool tip point so as to form a corner portion.
6. A non-transitory computer readable recording medium recording a data structure of CAD data in a control system which includes: a CAM device that generates a machining program based on the CAD data; and a numerical controller that drives, based on the machining program, a multi-axis machine tool including three linear axes and one or more rotary axes so as to produce an evaluation work piece, wherein the data structure is provided for machining at least one of, in the evaluation work piece, a curved surface portion in which an inclination of a tool is changed and which is formed with a free curved surface, a boundary portion of two regions of a flat surface which is machined at different angles of the tool and which includes the two adjacent regions and a corner portion in which an amount of movement of the rotary axis of the tool is larger than an amount of movement of a tool tip point.
