METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR THERAPEUTIC NEUROMODULATION
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods and computer-readable media are disclosed for providing therapeutic auditory stimulation. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, a system for providing therapeutic auditory stimulation may comprise a diagnostic unit that computes an EEG spectral density of a patient and a heart rate spectral density of a patient and provides values for one or more EEG frequency bands and one or more heart rate frequency bands. The system may also comprise a therapy unit that generates, based on the provided values, one or more stimulation waveforms corresponding to one or more of the EEG frequency bands and provides the stimulation waveforms for therapeutic auditory stimulation. The stimulation waveforms may comprise audible carrier frequencies modulated by signals with frequencies that vary exponentially with time. The EEG frequency bands may comprise the delta, theta, alpha, beta 1, beta 2, and gamma EEG frequency bands.

a therapy unit (330) comprising means for generating (510) one or more stimulation waveforms corresponding to one or more EEG frequency bands and means for providing (520) the stimulation waveforms for therapeutic auditory stimulation, wherein the stimulation waveforms comprise audible carrier frequencies modulated by signals with frequencies that vary non-linearly with time,
wherein the therapy unit is configured to receive values for one or more EEG frequency bands in order to generate the appropriate therapeutic auditory stimulation.
2. A system for providing therapeutic auditory stimulation comprising: a diagnostic unit (310) comprising a signal conditioning unit (410), a signal processing unit (420), electrodes (412, 414) and a heart rate monitor (418), wherein the diagnostic unit (310) is configured to compute an EEG spectral density of a patient and a heart rate spectral density of the patient and provide values for one or more EEG frequency bands and one or more heart rate frequency bands; a therapy unit (330) comprising means for generating (510) one or more stimulation waveforms corresponding to one or more of the EEG frequency bands and means for providing (520) the stimulation waveforms for therapeutic auditory stimulation, wherein the stimulation waveforms comprise audible carrier frequencies modulated by signals with frequencies that vary non-linearly with time, wherein either the diagnostic unit (310) is configured to automatically provide the therapy unit (330) with the values such that the therapy unit (330) generates the appropriate therapeutic auditory stimulation, or the diagnostic unit (310) is configured to provide the values to a user such that the user configures the therapy unit (330) to generate the appropriate therapeutic auditory stimulation.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the therapy unit (330) is configured to determine appropriate therapeutic auditory stimulation based upon the values provided by the diagnostic unit (310) such that either: (a) the values from the diagnostic unit (310) indicate an excessively contributing EEG band, and the therapy unit determines appropriate therapeutic auditory stimulation including one or more stimulation waveforms corresponding to the excessively contributing EEG band; or (b) the values from the diagnostic unit (310) indicate that each of the EEG bands contribute equally to the EEG power signal, and the therapy unit determines appropriate auditory stimulation including one or more stimulation waveforms corresponding to a midrange EEG band; or (c) the values from the diagnostic unit (310) indicate that the low frequency component of the heart rate is less than the high frequency component of the heart rate, and the therapy unit determines appropriate auditory stimulation including an initial stimulation waveform corresponding to a low EEG band; or (d) the values from the diagnostic unit (310) indicate that the low frequency component of the heart rate is greater than the high frequency component of the heart rate, and the therapy unit determines appropriate auditory stimulation including an initial stimulation waveform corresponding to a high EEG band.
