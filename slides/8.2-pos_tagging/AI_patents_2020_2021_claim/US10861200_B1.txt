<title>
System and method for diagrams
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for creating a diagram includes a display, a touch screen covering the display, and a processor coupled to the display and the touch screen. A memory coupled to the processor stores instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to generate a first diagram. The processor receives an input for selecting a surface and displays the surface on the display. The processor further detects the placement of a first object on the surface and detects a drawing of a first path of the first object from a first location to a second location. The processor is further configured to determine a first action associated with at least one of the first object, the first path, the first location, and the second location and draw on the surface a first diagram associated with the first action.

<claims>
1. A diagram creator device comprising: a display; a touch screen covering the display; a processor coupled to the display and the touch screen; and a memory coupled to the processor, wherein the memory stores instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to: receive an input for selecting a surface; display the surface on the display; detect the placement of a first object on the surface; detect a drawing of a first path of the first object from a first location to a second location; determine a first action associated with at least one of the first object, the first path, the first location, and the second location; and draw on the surface a first diagram associated with the first action.
2. The diagram creator device of claim 1, wherein the instructions that, when executed by the processor, further cause the processor to: detect the placement of a second object on the surface; detect the drawing of a second path of the second object from a third location to a fourth location; determine a second action associated with at least one of the second object, the second path, the third location, or the fourth location.
3. The diagram creator device of claim 2 wherein the instructions that, when executed by the processor, further cause the processor to: generate an animation in accordance with at least one of the first object, the first path, the first location, and the second location.
4. The diagram creator device of claim 2, wherein the instructions that, when executed by the processor, further cause the processor to: generate an animation in accordance with at least one of the second object, the second path, the third location, and the fourth location.
5. The diagram creator device of claim 4, wherein the animation is generated according to a relative velocity.
6. The diagram creator device of claim 2, wherein the first object comprises a first player and the second object comprises a ball.
7. The diagram creator device of claim 3, wherein the instructions that, when executed by the processor, further cause the processor to: detect the placement of a third object comprising a second player the surface; detect the drawing of a third path of the third object from a fifth location to a sixth location; determine a third action associated with at least one of the third object, the third path, the fifth location, or the sixth location; and draw on the surface a second diagram associated with the first action, the second action, and the third.
8. The diagram creator device of claim 3, wherein the first action comprises moving from the first location to the second location, the second action comprises dribbling the ball and passing the ball to the second player, and the third action comprises receiving the ball.
9. The diagram creator device of claim 7 wherein the instructions that, when executed by the processor, further cause the processor to: generate an animation in accordance with the first action, the second action and the third action, wherein the animation is sequentially timed in accordance with first location, second location, third location, fourth location, fifth location, sixth location, first action, second action, and third action.
10. The diagram creator device of claim 1 wherein the instructions that, when executed by the processor, further cause the processor to generate a question according to the first diagram.
