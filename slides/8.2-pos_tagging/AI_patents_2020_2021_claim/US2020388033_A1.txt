SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTOMATIC LABELING OF PATHOLOGY IMAGES
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems are provided for automatically classifying cells in a histological stained image. In an example, a method includes automatically classifying a plurality of cells in an image of a biological sample stained with a histological stain using a classification model, the classification model trained with a plurality of automatically-classified pseudo-stained images each generated from a respective immunofluorescent image.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: automatically classifying a plurality of cells in an image of a biological sample stained with a histological stain using a classification model, the classification model trained with a plurality of automatically-classified pseudo stained images each generated from a respective immunofluorescent image.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the classifying includes entering the image into the classification model, the classification model configured to output a labeled version of the image where each classified cell in the image is labeled with a respective classification determined by the classification model.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising outputting the labeled version of the image for display and/or storage.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the classifying includes identifying, via the classification model, the plurality of cells in the image and classifying, via the classification model, each identified cell as either a non-tumor cell or a tumor cell.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the classifying includes identifying, via the classification model, the plurality of cells in the image and classifying, via the classification model, one or more identified cells as a regulatory T cell, a cytotoxic T cell, a B cell, or a macrophage.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the classifying includes assigning each cell of the plurality of cells to an identified tissue type.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the biological sample is stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain, and wherein the pseudo stained images comprise pseudo H&E stained images.
8. A method, comprising: training a classification model to automatically classify each of a first plurality of cells in an image of a biological sample stained with a histological stain, the training including: obtaining a plurality of immunofluorescent (IF) images, each IF image including a cell labeled with one or more fluorophores, each fluorophore configured to tag, via a respective primary antibody, a respective target biomarker; automatically classifying each cell in the plurality of IF images based on a biomarker signature exhibited by each cell as determined based on a signal intensity level for each fluorophore of each cell; converting each IF image to a pseudo stained image to thereby generate a plurality of pseudo stained images; and training the classification model with the plurality of pseudo stained images and associated cell classifications.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein obtaining the plurality of IF images comprises: obtaining an original IF image including a second plurality of cells, each cell of the second plurality of cells labeled with DAPI, identifying each cell of the second plurality of cells in the original IF image based on one or more of a DAPI signal intensity, nucleus size, and nucleus shape, where the nucleus size and nucleus shape are determined from the DAPI labeling, and extracting each identified cell into a respective separate IF image to form the plurality of IF images.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein converting each IF image to a pseudo stained image includes converting each IF image to a pseudo hematoxylin and eosin stained image.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein automatically classifying each cell based on a biomarker signature exhibited by each cell of the second plurality of cells comprises: automatically classifying each cell that exhibits a first biomarker signature as a tumor cell; and automatically classifying each cell that exhibits a second biomarker signature as a normal cell.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein automatically classifying each cell based on a biomarker signature exhibited by each cell of the second plurality of cells comprises: automatically classifying each cell that exhibits a first biomarker signature as a regulatory T cell; automatically classifying each cell that exhibits a second biomarker signature as a cytotoxic T cell; automatically classifying each cell that exhibits a third biomarker signature as a B T cell; and automatically classifying each cell that exhibits a fourth biomarker signature as a macrophage cell.
13. A computing device, comprising: a processor; and a memory storing instructions executable by the processor to automatically classify a plurality of cells in an image of a biological sample stained with a histological stain using a classification model, the classification model trained with a plurality of automatically-labeled pseudo-stained images each generated from a respective immunofluorescent image.
14. The computing device of claim 13, wherein the instructions executable to classify the plurality of cells include instructions executable to enter the image into the classification model, the classification model configured to output a labeled version of the image where each classified cell in the image is labeled with a respective classification determined by the classification model.
15. The computing device of claim 14, wherein the instructions are executable to output the labeled version of the image for display and/or storage.
16. The computing device of claim 13, wherein the instructions executable to classify the plurality of cells include instructions executable to identify, via the classification model, the plurality of cells in the image and classify, via the classification model, each identified cell as either a non-tumor cell or a tumor cell.
17. The computing device of claim 13, wherein the instructions executable to classify the plurality of cells include instructions executable to identify, via the classification model, the plurality of cells in the image and classify, via the classification model, one or more identified cells as a regulatory T cell, a cytotoxic T cell, a B cell, or a macrophage.
18. The computing device of claim 13, wherein the instructions executable to classify the plurality of cells include instructions executable to assign each cell of the plurality of cells to an identified tissue type.
19. The computing device of claim 13, wherein the biological sample is stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain, and wherein the pseudo stained images comprise pseudo H&E stained images.
20. The computing device of claim 13, wherein the image is acquired with a bright field microscope and associated image capture device.
