SYSTEM AND METHODS TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SUPPORT USING LIGHTING INFRASTRUCTURE
</title>

<abstract>
A system and methods are provided for an emergency support system installed in light poles. Each emergency support system continuously monitors for motion to identify anomalous motion activity on a local level. In response, a notification is sent to a base station that provides a global analysis by collecting motion data from nearby emergency support systems. An alert is generated if anomalous motion is detected across multiple emergency support systems.

<claims>
1. A method for providing emergency support by an emergency support system (103) installed in a light pole (101), the method comprising:
recording, by a sensor (206) of the emergency support system, sample data (304, 401) in a buffer (221), wherein the sample data indicates whether motion is detected at each sample time;
determining a degree of motion activity based on the sample data; comparing the degree of motion activity to a threshold to determine an occurrence of an anomalous motion event; and
transmitting to a base station (108) data indicating the occurrence of the anomalous motion event, wherein the base station is capable of:
communicating with a plurality of other emergency support systems installed in respective light poles, each of the other emergency support systems being configured to record respective sample data;
identifying a subset of the at least one of the other emergency support systems based on the proximity relative to the emergency support system; and
in response to the base station receiving the data indicating the occurrence of the anomalous motion event, transmitting an instruction to the subset to upload the respective sample data associated with the subset.
2. The method of Claim 1, wherein the base station is further capable of:
receiving the respective sample data from the subset in response to the instruction;
determining whether the respective sample data from the subset expresses a second occurrence of an anomalous event; and
generating an alert in response to determining the second occurrence of an anomalous event.
3. The method of Claim 1, wherein the sample data comprises a binary indication of whether motion was detected at each sample time, wherein the degree of motion activity is determined by calculating the number of consecutive samples that indicate a presence of motion.
4. The method of Claim 1, wherein the threshold is determined based on the motion of a moving vehicle.
5. The method of Claim 1, wherein the emergency support system comprises a Global Position System (GPS) module (215), the method further comprising obtaining time and location data from the GPS module and transmitting the time and location data to the base station.
6. The method of Claim 1, wherein the sensor comprises a passive infrared sensor.
7. The method of Claim 1, further comprising periodically transmitting the sample data in a buffer to the base station at a predetermined interval.
8. The method of Claim 1, wherein the emergency support system comprises a power supply (212) that couples to a power source that powers the light pole.
9. The method of Claim 1, wherein the buffer comprises a circular buffer that overwrites the sample data.
10. The method of Claim 1, wherein the instruction to the subset comprises a start and stop time for when the respective sample data should be uploaded by each of the at least one of the other emergency support systems in the subset.
11. An emergency support system (103) configured to be installed in a light pole (101), comprising:
a sensor (206) configured to record sample data (304, 401) in a buffer (221), wherein the sample data indicates whether motion is detected at each sample time;
a base station (108);
a processor (203); and a memory (218) that stores computer instructions, which, when executed, cause the processor to:
determine a degree of motion activity based on the sample data; compare the degree of motion activity to a threshold to determine an occurrence of an anomalous motion event; and
transmit to the base station data indicating the occurrence of the anomalous motion event;
wherein the base station is configured to:
communicate with a plurality of other emergency support systems installed in respective light poles, each of the other emergency support systems being configured to record respective sample data;
identify a subset of the at least one of the other emergency support systems based on the proximity relative to the emergency support system; and
in response to the base station receiving the data indicating the occurrence of the anomalous motion event, transmit an instruction to the subset to upload the respective sample data associated with the subset.
12. The emergency support system of Claim 11, wherein the base station is further configured to:
receive the respective sample data from the subset in response to the instruction;
determine whether the respective sample data from the subset expresses a second occurrence of an anomalous event; and
generate an alert in response to determining the second occurrence of an anomalous event.
13. The emergency support system of Claim 11, wherein the sample data comprises a binary indication of whether motion was detected at each sample time, wherein the degree of motion activity is determined by calculating the number of consecutive samples that indicate a presence of motion.
14. The emergency support system of Claim 11, wherein the threshold is determined based on the motion of a moving vehicle.
15. The emergency support system of Claim 11, further comprising a Global
Position System (GPS) module (215), the method further comprising obtaining time and location data from the GPS module and transmitting the time and location data to the base station.
