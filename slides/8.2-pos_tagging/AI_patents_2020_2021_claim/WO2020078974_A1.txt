<title>
MAPPING IMAGE SIGNATURES OF CANCER CELLS TO GENETIC SIGNATURES
</title>

<abstract>
A method (100) for treating a patient, comprising: (i) receiving (114) a sample from a patient, the sample comprising one or more cancer cells; (ii) obtaining (116), using an imaging device, one or more images of the cancer cells; (iii) processing (120), using an imaging processor, the one or more images to extract one or more image coefficients; (iv) mapping (122), using a trained classifier, the one or more image coefficients to a cancer cell type; (v) identifying (124), based on mapping the one or more image coefficients to a cancer cell type, one or more cancer cell types in the sample; (vi) identifying (126), based on the identified one or more cancer cell types in the sample, a course of treatment specific to the one or more cancer cell types; and (vii) treating (130) the patient using the identified course of treatment.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method (100) for treating a patient, comprising:
receiving (114) a sample from a patient, the sample comprising one or more cancer cells;
obtaining (116), using an imaging device, one or more images of the cancer cells; processing (120), using an imaging processor, the one or more images to extract one or more image coefficients;
mapping (122), using a trained classifier, the one or more image coefficients to a cancer cell type;
identifying (124), based on mapping the one or more image coefficients to a cancer cell type, one or more cancer cell types in the sample;
identifying (126), based on the identified one or more cancer cell types in the sample, a course of treatment specific to the one or more cancer cell types; and
treating (130) the patient using the identified course of treatment.
2. The method of claim 1 , wherein the cancer type is a cancer sub-type.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of mapping further comprises mapping (122) the one or more image coefficients to a genetic signature.
4. The method of claim 1 , further comprising the step of reporting (128) the identified course of treatment.
5. The method of claim 1 , further comprising the step of obtaining (118) information of a second mode about the cancer cells, wherein processing the one or more images to extract one or more image coefficients comprises processing the obtained images and the obtained information of a second mode.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of training (112) the classifier to map image coefficients to a cancer cell type.
7. The method of claim 1 , wherein the sample is a biopsy.
8. The method of claim 1 , wherein the sample is a body fluid.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of processing comprises fractal-based image processing, wavelet-based image processing, spectroscopic image processing, and/or pattern-matching image processing.
10. A system (200) configured to identify a course of treatment specific to an identified cancer cell type, comprising:
a sample from an individual, the sample comprising one or more cancer cells; a first imaging device (217) configured to obtain one or more images of the cancer cells;
a processor (220) configured to process the one or more images to extract one or more image coefficients; and
a trained classifier (264) configured to: (i) map the one or more image coefficients to a cancer cell type; and (ii) identify, based on mapping the one or more image coefficients to a cancer cell type, one or more cancer cell types in the sample;
wherein the processor is further configured to identify, based on the identified one or more cancer cell types in the sample, a course of treatment specific to the one or more cancer cell types.
11. The system of claim 10, further comprising a cancer cell type database (265) comprising a plurality of cancer cell types each associated with one or more image coefficients, wherein the trained classifier utilizes the cancer cell type database to map the one or more image coefficients to the cancer cell type.
12. The system of claim 10, further comprising a treatment plan database (266) comprising a plurality of treatment plans each associated with a cancer cell type, wherein the processor utilizes the treatment plan database to identify a course of treatment.
13. The system of claim 10, further comprising a user interface (240) configured to provide a report of the identified course of treatment to a user.
14. The system of claim 10, wherein the trained classifier is further configured to map the one or more image coefficients to a genetic signature.
15. The system of claim 10, further comprising a second imaging device (217) of a mode different from the first imaging device, the second imaging device configured to obtain information about the cancer cells.
