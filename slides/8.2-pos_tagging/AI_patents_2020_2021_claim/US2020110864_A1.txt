ENROLLMENT WITH AN AUTOMATED ASSISTANT
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques are described herein for dialog-based enrollment of individual users for single- and/or multi-modal recognition by an automated assistant, as well as determining how to respond to a particular user's request based on the particular user being enrolled and/or recognized. Rather than requiring operation of a graphical user interface for individual enrollment, dialog-based enrollment enables users to enroll themselves (or others) by way of a human-to-computer dialog with the automated assistant.

<claims>
1. A method implemented using one or more processors, comprising: capturing a plurality of images of a person using a vision sensor; transmitting the plurality of images to a remote computing device over one or more networks; receiving, from the remote computing device over one or more of the networks, a message, wherein the message identifies at least one image of the plurality of images as usable to create biometric data that is suitable subsequently to authenticate the person to a computing resource; based on the message, generating the biometric data using the at least one image of the plurality of images; and enrolling the person with the computing resource based on the biometric data.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the biometric data comprises a latent space embedding.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the latent space embedding is generated based on application of the at least one image of the plurality of images as input across a machine learning model.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the capturing and transmitting are performed at least in part using a hand held first client device.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the generating is performed by a stationary second client device.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the enrolling comprises creating an association between an identity of the person and the biometric data in memory of the stationary second client device.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the computing resource comprises an automated assistant that semantically processes natural language input to determine an intent, and performs one or more responsive actions based on the intent.
8. A method implemented using one or more processors, comprising: receiving a plurality of images of a person from a remote client device; analyzing the plurality of images to identify at least one image of the plurality of images as usable to create biometric data that is suitable subsequently to authenticate a person to a computing resource; and transmitting, to the remote client device, a message that identifies the at least one image as usable to create biometric data; wherein the transmitting causes one or more client devices of a coordinated ecosystem of client devices that includes the remote client device to generate the biometric data using the at least one image.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the biometric data comprises a latent space embedding.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the analyzing comprises determining that the at least one image of the plurality of images does not capture any faces other than that of the person.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein the analyzing comprises determining that the at least one image of the plurality of images satisfies one or more quality criterion.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the analyzing comprises applying the at least one image of the plurality of images as input across a machine learning model to generate output, wherein the output indicatives that the at least one image is usable to create the biometric data.
13. The method of claim 8, wherein the computing resource comprises an automated assistant that semantically processes natural language input to determine an intent, and performs one or more responsive actions based on the intent.
14. At least one non-transitory computer-readable medium comprising instructions that, in response to execution by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform the following operations: capturing a plurality of images of a person using a vision sensor; transmitting the plurality of images to a remote computing device over one or more networks; receiving, from the remote computing device over one or more of the networks, a message, wherein the message identifies at least one image of the plurality of images as usable to create biometric data that is suitable subsequently to authenticate the person to a computing resource; based on the message, generating the biometric data using the at least one image of the plurality of image; and enrolling the person with the computing resource based on the biometric data.
15. The at least one non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 14, wherein the biometric data comprises a latent space embedding.
16. The at least one non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the latent space embedding is generated based on application of the at least one image of the plurality of images as input across a machine learning model.
17. The at least one non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 14, wherein the capturing and transmitting are performed at least in part using a hand held first client device.
18. The at least one non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 17, wherein the generating is performed by a stationary second client device.
19. The at least one non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 18, wherein the enrolling comprises creating an association between an identity of the person and the biometric data in memory of the stationary second client device.
20. The at least one non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 14, wherein the computing resource comprises an automated assistant that semantically processes natural language input to determine an intent, and performs one or more responsive actions based on the intent.
