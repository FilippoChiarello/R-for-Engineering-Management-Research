DIAGNOSIS SUPPORT DEVICE, LEARNING DEVICE, DIAGNOSIS SUPPORT METHOD, LEARNING METHOD, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
A device for supporting diagnosis has: a reception unit that is configured to receive a fundus image of a subject eye; an identification unit provided with a trained model that is configured to recognize, in the fundus image of the subject eye, an area of abnormality in blood circulation, wherein the model has been trained based upon an image of a fundus and an area of abnormality in blood circulation specified in a fluorescent angiography image of the fundus; and an output unit that is configured to output information relating to the area of abnormality in blood circulation recognized in the fundus image of the subject eye.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A device for supporting diagnosis comprising: a reception unit that is configured to receive a fundus image of a subject eye; an identification unit provided with a trained model that is configured to recognize, in the fundus image of the subject eye, an area of abnormality in blood circulation, wherein the model has been trained based upon an image of a fundus and an area of abnormality in blood circulation specified in a fluorescent angiography image of the fundus; and an output unit that is configured to output information relating to the area of abnormality in blood circulation recognized in the fundus image of the subject eye.
2. The device for supporting diagnosis according to claim 1,
wherein the area of abnormality in blood circulation specified in the fluorescein angiography image is generated on the basis of the fluorescein angiography image and an ophthalmologist's diagnostic note regarding one or both of a retinal non-perfusion area and a neovascularization attached to the fluorescein angiography image.
3. The device for supporting diagnosis according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein the identification unit is configured to recognize one or both of a retinal non-perfusion area and an area corresponding to a neovascularization in the fundus image.
4. The device for supporting diagnosis according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the output unit is configured to output an image in which the area of abnormality in blood circulation recognized by the identification unit is overlaid on the fundus image.
5. A learning device comprising:
a learning unit that generates, on the basis of a fundus image that is an image of a fundus and an area of abnormality in blood circulation specified on the basis of a fluorescein angiography image of the fundus, a trained model indicating a relationship between the fundus image and the area of abnormality in blood circulation in the fundus image, through learning.
6. The learning device according to claim 5,
wherein the area of abnormality in blood circulation is generated on the basis of the fluorescein angiography image and an ophthalmologist's diagnostic note regarding one or both of the retinal non-perfusion area and the neovascularization attached to the fluorescein angiography image.
7. A method for supporting diagnosis executed by a diagnosis support device, the method comprising: receiving a fundus image of a subject eye recognizing an area of abnormality in blood circulation in the fundus image of the subject eye, using a trained model that has been trained based upon an image of fundus and an area of abnormality in blood circulation specified in a fluorescent angiography image of the fundus; and outputting information relating to the area of abnormality in blood circulation recognized in the fundus image of the subject eye.
8. A learning method executed by a learning device, the method comprising: acquiring information indicating a fundus image that is an image of a fundus, and information indicating an area of abnormality in blood circulation specified on the basis of a fluorescein angiography image of the fundus; and generating, on the basis of the acquired fundus image and the acquired area of abnormality in blood circulation specified on the basis of the fluorescein angiography image of the fundus, a trained model indicating a relationship between the fundus image and an area of abnormality in blood circulation in the fundus image, through training.
9. A program causing a computer of a diagnosis support device to execute: receiving a fundus image of a subject eye recognizing an area of abnormality in blood circulation in the fundus image of the subject eye, using a trained model that has been trained based upon an image of fundus and an area of abnormality in blood circulation specified in a fluorescent angiography image of the fundus; and outputting information relating to the area of abnormality in blood circulation recognized in the fundus image of the subject eye.
10. A program causing a computer of a learning device to execute: acquiring information indicating a fundus image that is an image of a fundus, and information indicating an area of abnormality in blood circulation specified on the basis of a fluorescein angiography image of the fundus; and generating, on the basis of the acquired fundus image and the acquired the area of abnormality in blood circulation specified on the basis of the fluorescein angiography image of the fundus, a trained model indicating a relationship between the fundus image and ab area of abnormality in blood circulation in the fundus image, through learning.
