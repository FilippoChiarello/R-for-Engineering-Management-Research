AUTONOMOUS ELECTRONIC BICYCLE
</title>

<abstract>
An autonomous electronic bicycle comprises a frame, a front wheel that can be powered by a first electronic motor, a rear wheel that can be powered by a second electronic motor, and handlebars that can steer the front wheel which can be controlled by a third electronic motor. Similarly, the autonomous electronic bicycle can comprise a set of sensors used for autonomous navigation. The autonomous electronic bicycle can operate autonomously, traveling to a chosen destination by controlling at least the first, second, and third electronic motors. The autonomous electronic bicycle can further be manually ridden by a rider as a traditional bicycle.

<claims>
1. An autonomous electronic bicycle, comprising: a frame; a front wheel coupled to the frame; a rear wheel coupled to the frame; a set of handlebars coupled to the frame and configured to change an orientation of the front wheel in response to movement of the handlebars; a first electronic motor coupled to the frame and configured to spin the rear wheel; a second electronic motor coupled to the frame and configured to spin the front wheel; a third electronic motor coupled to the frame and configured to turn the set of handlebars; and a controller configured to autonomously move the bicycle from a first location to a second location when the bicycle is configured to operate in an autonomous mode by driving the first electronic motor, the second electronic motor, and the third electronic motor.
2. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 1, wherein the autonomous electronic bicycle further includes a set of pedals, and wherein the autonomous electronic bicycle does not include a mechanical connection between the pedals and the rear wheel.
3. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 2, wherein a user can move the bicycle using the set of pedals when the bicycle is configured to operate in a manual mode.
4. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 3, wherein the set of pedals, when pedaled by the user, are configured to produce a signal representative of the pedaling by the user.
5. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 4, wherein the controller is configured to drive the first electronic motor and the second electronic motor using the produced signal representative of the pedaling by the user.
6. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 1, further comprising one or more sensors configured to produce signals representative of an orientation of the bicycle, and wherein the controller is configured to drive the third electronic motor based on the produced signals.
7. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 6, wherein the one or more sensors include one or more of: an IMU, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a magnetometer, and a motion detector.
8. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 1, further comprising a kickstand and a fourth electronic motor configured to extend or retract the kickstand.
9. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 8, wherein the controller is configured to drive the fourth electronic motor to retract the kickstand in response to the bicycle transitioning from a stop to movement, and to drive the fourth electronic motor to extend the kickstand in response to the bicycle transitioning from movement to a stop.
10. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 1, further comprising a power source coupled to the frame and configured to provide power to the first electronic motor, the second electronic motor, the third electronic motor, and the controller.
11. An autonomous electronic bicycle, comprising: a frame; a front wheel coupled to the frame; a rear wheel coupled to the frame; a first electronic motor coupled to the frame and configured to spin one or both of the rear wheel and the front wheel; a second electronic motor coupled to the frame and configured to change an orientation of the front wheel relative to the frame; and a controller configured to autonomously move the bicycle from a first location to a second location when the bicycle is configured to operate in an autonomous mode by driving the first electronic motor and the second electronic motor.
12. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 11, wherein the autonomous electronic bicycle further includes a set of pedals, and wherein the autonomous electronic bicycle does not include a mechanical connection between the pedals and the rear wheel.
13. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 12, wherein a user can move the bicycle using the set of pedals when the bicycle is configured to operate in a manual mode.
14. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 13, wherein the set of pedals, when pedaled by the user, are configured to produce a signal representative of the pedaling by the user.
15. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 14, wherein the controller is configured to drive the first electronic motor and the second electronic motor using the produced signal representative of the pedaling by the user.
16. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 11, further comprising one or more sensors configured to produce signals representative of an orientation of the bicycle, and wherein the controller is configured to drive the third electronic motor based on the produced signals.
17. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 16, wherein the one or more sensors include one or more of: an IMU, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a magnetometer, and a motion detector.
18. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 11, further comprising a kickstand and a third electronic motor configured to extend or retract the kickstand.
19. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 18, wherein the controller is configured to drive the third electronic motor to retract the kickstand in response to the bicycle transitioning from a stop to movement, and to drive the fourth electronic motor to extend the kickstand in response to the bicycle transitioning from movement to a stop.
20. The autonomous electronic bicycle of claim 11, further comprising a power source coupled to the frame and configured to provide power to the first electronic motor, the second electronic motor, and the controller.
