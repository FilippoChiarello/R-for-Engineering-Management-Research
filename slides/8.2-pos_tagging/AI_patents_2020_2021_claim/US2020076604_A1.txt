<title>
AUTHENTICATION METHOD AND SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
An authentication method includes an enrolment stage comprising: receiving fuzzy data from a noisy authentication factor and fixed authentication data; generating a secret string independently from the received fuzzy data and the received fixed authentication data; deriving metadata from the fuzzy data and the secret string and helper data from the secret string and metadata; encrypting the helper data using the fixed authentication data as encryption key; outputting the encrypted helper data as public data, and an authentication stage including receiving the public data output during the enrolment stage, decrypting the received public data using the fixed authentication data as decryption key, recovering the helper data and the metadata from the decrypted public data, reproducing the secret string using the further fuzzy data and the recovered metadata, validating the reproduced secret string using the recovered helper data, and releasing the reproduced secret string if the validating yields a positive outcome.

<claims>
1. 1.-17. (canceled)
18. An authentication method comprising an enrolment step comprising: receiving fuzzy data from a noisy authentication factor, and fixed authentication data, generating a secret string independently from said received fuzzy data and said received fixed authentication data, deriving metadata from said fuzzy data and said secret string and helper data from said secret string and said metadata, encrypting said helper data using said fixed authentication data as encryption key; outputting said encrypted helper data as public data, and an authentication step comprising: receiving said public data output during said enrolment step, further fuzzy data and said fixed authentication data, decrypting said received public data using said fixed authentication data as decryption key, recovering said helper data from said decrypted public data, reproducing said secret string using said further fuzzy data and recovered metadata obtained via said recovered helper data, validating said reproduced secret string using said recovered helper data, releasing said reproduced secret string if said validating yields a positive outcome.
19. The authentication method according to claim 18, where the entropy of said fuzzy data given said metadata is greater than or equal to the length of said secret string.
20. The authentication method of claim 18, wherein it is at least computationally infeasible to derive from said public data information about said fuzzy data.
21. The authentication method of claim 20, wherein the mutual information between said fuzzy data and said public data is substantially zero.
22. The authentication method of claim 18, wherein said output public data is stored in a personal device.
23. The authentication method of claim 18, wherein said output public data is stored in a server.
24. The authentication method of claim 18, wherein said output public data is stored in a token.
25. The authentication method of claim 18, wherein said fuzzy data is provided by a biometric source.
26. The authentication method of claim 18, wherein said fuzzy data is provided by a physically unclonable function, PUF, source.
27. The authentication method of claim 26, wherein said PUF is provided with a fixed challenge.
28. The authentication method of claim 18, wherein said fuzzy data and/or said further fuzzy data is acquired either simultaneously or consecutively.
29. The authentication method of claim 28, wherein said fuzzy data and/or said further fuzzy data is provided by a combination of biometric sources and/or PUF sources.
30. The authentication method of claim 18, wherein said fixed authentication data is stored in a file or in an authentication token, or is derived from password or a passphrase.
31. The authentication method of claim 30, wherein said fixed authentication data is a combination of a plurality of fixed authentication data, acquired either simultaneously or consecutively.
32. The authentication method of claim 18, where in said enrolment step also said secret string is output.
33. The authentication method of claim 18, wherein said secret string is generated using a random generator.
34. A program, executable on a programmable device containing instructions, which, when executed, perform the method of claim 18.
35. An authentication system comprising: enrolment means adapted to: receive fuzzy data from a noisy authentication factor and fixed authentication data, generate a secret string independently from said received fuzzy data and said received fixed authentication data, derive metadata from said fuzzy data and said secret string and helper data from said secret string and said metadata, encrypt said helper data using said fixed authentication data as encryption key, output said encrypted helper data as the public data, authentication means adapted to: receive said public data output, further fuzzy data and said fixed authentication data, decrypt said received public data using said fixed authentication data as decryption key, recover said helper data and said metadata from said decrypted public data, reproduce said secret string using said further fuzzy data and said recovered metadata, validate said reproduced secret string using said recovered helper data, release said reproduced secret string if said validating yields a positive outcome.
