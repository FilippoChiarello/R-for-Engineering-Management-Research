<title>
Normalizing insufficient signals based on additional information
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention extends to methods, systems, and computer program products for normalizing insufficient signals based on additional information. A probability of an event occurring is detected from a raw signal. It is determined signal characteristics of the raw signal are insufficient to normalize the raw signal along at least one of: a time, location, or context dimension. In one aspect, an additional signal relevant to the signal is ingested. In another aspect, a previously detected event relevant to the signal is accessed from a geo cell database. The raw signal is normalized, including deriving at least one of: the time dimension, the location dimension, or the context dimension from a combination of the signal characteristics and characteristics of the other signal and/or characteristics of the previously detected event.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: a processor; and system memory coupled to the processor and storing instructions configured to cause the processor to: ingest a first signal; determine a plurality of signal characteristics of the first signal; determine that the plurality of signal characteristics are insufficient to normalize the first signal along at least one of a time dimension, a location dimension, or a context dimension; based on determining that the signal characteristics are insufficient, ingest a second signal; and apply a transdimensionality transform to data in the first signal to re-encode the data from the first signal into normalized data having lower dimensionality than the first signal, including deriving at least one of the time dimension, the location dimension, or the context dimension from a combination of the plurality of signal characteristics of the first signal and at least one characteristic of the second signal.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the first signal is ingested from a first signal source and the second signal is ingested from a second signal source.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the first signal source is of a first signal type and the second signal source is of a second signal type.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of signal characteristics are insufficient to normalize the first signal along the location dimension.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the second signal is identified based on having a time dimension and/or a context dimension that is relevant to the first signal.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of signal characteristics are insufficient to normalize the first signal along either or both of the time dimension and/or the context dimension.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the second signal is identified based on having a location dimension that is relevant to the first signal.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the quantity of dimensions of the first signal is greater than the quantity of dimensions of the normalized version of the first signal.
9. The system of claim 1, the first signal is a social signal and the second signal is a streaming signal.
10. The system of claim 1, further comprising instructions configured to: detect an event based on at least one of the time dimension, the location dimension, or the context dimension of the normalized data; determine the event is relevant to an entity; and notify the entity about the event.
11. A method executed at a computer system comprising one or more processors for supplementing a first signal with a related second signal, the method comprising: ingesting a first signal; determining a plurality of signal characteristics of the first signal; determining that the plurality of signal characteristics are insufficient to normalize the first signal along at least one of a time dimension, a location dimension, or a context dimension; based on determining that the signal characteristics are insufficient, ingesting a plurality of additional signals; identifying a second signal from the plurality of additional signals that is relevant to the signal; and applying a transdimensionality transform to data in the first signal to re-encode the data from the first signal into normalized data having lower dimensionality than the first signal, including deriving at least one of the time dimension, the location dimension, or the context dimension from a combination of the plurality of signal characteristics of the first signal and characteristics of the second signal.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the first signal is ingested from a first signal source and the second signal is ingested from a second signal source.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the first signal source is of a first signal type and the second signal source is of a second signal type.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein the plurality of signal characteristics are insufficient to normalize the first signal along the location dimension.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the second signal is identified based on having a time dimension and/or a context dimension that is relevant to the first signal.
16. The method of claim 11, wherein the plurality of signal characteristics are insufficient to normalize the first signal along either or both of the time dimension and/or the context dimension.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the second signal is identified based on having a location dimension that is relevant to the first signal.
18. The method of claim 11, wherein the quantity of dimensions of the first signal is greater than the quantity of dimensions of the normalized version of the first signal.
19. The method of claim 11, the first signal is a social signal and the second signal is a streaming signal.
20. The method of claim 11, further comprising instructions configured to: detect an event based on at least one of the time dimension, the location dimension, or the context dimension of the normalized data; determine the event is relevant to an entity; and notify the entity about the event.
