CLASSIFICATION BASED ON CHARACTERIZATION ANALYSIS METHODS AND SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
A method at a computing device for classifying elements within an input, the method including breaking the input into a plurality of patches; for each patch: creating a vector output; applying a characterization map to select a classification bin from a plurality of classification bins; and utilizing the selected classification bin to classify the vector output to create a classified output; and compiling the classified output from each patch.
