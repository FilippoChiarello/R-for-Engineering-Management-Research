RADIOMETRIC FILL LEVEL MEASURING DEVICE WITH REFERENCE SCINTILLATOR
</title>

<abstract>
A method for compensating a measurement deviation of a first scintillator and/or a photodetector of a radiometric fill level measuring device is provided, including detecting, by a second scintillator, radioactive emissions from the second scintillator; transmitting, in response to radioactive emissions, a first light signal from the first scintillator and a second light signal from the second scintillator, the first light signal being different from the second light signal; receiving, by the photodetector, the first light signal from the first scintillator and the second light signal from the second scintillator, and converting the light signals into electrical signals; comparing the electrical signals with deposited reference signals by means of a comparator; and adjusting the gain of the photodetector in response to comparing the electrical signals and stored reference signals. A radiometric fill level measuring device for fill level measurement, for density measurement, and/or for mass flow measurement is also provided.

<claims>
1. A method for compensating a measurement deviation of a first scintillator and/or of a photodetector of a radiometric fill level measuring device for fill level measurement, comprising: detecting, by a second scintillator, radioactive emissions of the second scintillator; transmitting, in response to radioactive emissions, a first light signal from the first scintillator and a second light signal from the second scintillator, the first light signal being different from the second light signal; receiving, by the photodetector, the first light signal from the first scintillator and the second light signal from the second scintillator, and converting the received light signals into electrical signals; comparing, by a comparator, the electrical signals to stored reference signals; and adjusting a gain of the photodetector in response to the comparing of the electrical signals and stored reference signals.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining a current temperature and the reference signal stored in a manner suitable for the current temperature.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the measurement deviation is a function of temperature, and the reference signals to match the temperature are stored in a comparison table.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the first scintillator is adjacent to the second scintillator.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the measurement deviation of the first scintillator and/or of the photodetector is caused by aging of the first scintillator and/or of the photodetector.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein a discrimination, by a discriminating device, of the first light signal from the first scintillator and of the second light signal from the second scintillator, is performed on the basis of a different transit time, a different color, and/or a different intensity of light signals.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the second scintillator is one of the following scintillators: lutetium aluminum garnet (LuAG), cerium-doped lutetium yttrium silicate (LYSO), lutetiumoxyorthosilicate (LSO), yttrium aluminum perovskite (cerium) (YAP:Ce), yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG), and/or a similar scintillator.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: transmitting an alarm when neither the first light signal is transmitted and/or received by the first scintillator nor the second light signal is transmitted and/or received by the second scintillator.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the second scintillator is shielded from a gamma emitter and/or a further external radiation source.
10. A radiometric fill level measuring device for fill level measurement, for density measurement, and/or for mass flow measurement, the fill level measuring device comprising: a first scintillator configured to detect radioactive emissions from a gamma emitter and, in response to the radioactive emissions, to emit a first light signal; a second scintillator configured to detect radioactive emissions from the second scintillator and, in response to the radioactive emissions, to transmit a second light signal, the second light signal being different from the first light signal; a photodetector configured to receive and to convert the first light signal and the second light signal into electrical signals; and a comparator configured to compare the electrical signals with stored electrical reference signals, wherein a gain of the photodetector is adjusted in response to a comparison of the electrical signals and stored reference signals.
11. The device of claim 10, further comprising: a discriminating device configured to discriminate the first light signal and the second light signal based on a different signal travel time, a different color, and/or an intensity of the first light signal and the second light signal.
12. The device of claim 10, wherein the second scintillator is one of the following scintillators: lutetium aluminum garnet (LuAG), cerium-doped lutetium yttrium silicate (LYSO), lutetiumoxyorthosilicate (LSO), yttrium aluminum perovskite (cerium) (YAP:Ce), yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG), and/or a similar scintillator.
13. A nontransitory computer-readable storage medium having a program stored therein, which, when executed on a processor of a radiometric fill level measuring device, instructs the radiometric fill level measuring device to carry out a method according to claim 1.
