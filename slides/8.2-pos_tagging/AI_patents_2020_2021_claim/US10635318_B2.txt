<title>
Logical storage driver
</title>

<abstract>
A technology is described for a logical storage driver. An example method can include using the logical storage driver to: forward requests to a first storage stack for processing of an I/O workload associated with the I/O requests. Initiate generation of trace data for the I/O workload for collection and analysis to determine a second storage stack for improving performance of the I/O workload. Receive the storage processing logic for processing the I/O workloads using the storage configuration for the I/O workload, where the storage processing logic interfaces with the storage configuration. Intercept the I/O requests that correspond to the I/O workload. And, process the I/O workloads using the storage processing logic that interfaces with the storage configuration.

1. A data storage system, comprising: at least one processor; a memory device including instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the data storage system to: receive, with a logical storage driver in a detached mode, a request to perform an I/O (input/output) workload, and forward, by the logical storage driver in the detached mode, the I/O workload to a default storage stack; determine, with the logical storage driver, a second storage stack based on analysis of collected trace data, the second storage stack including storage processing logic defined for the I/O workload and a storage configuration defined for the I/O workload; attach the storage processing logic according to the second storage stack to the logical storage driver; process, with the logical storage driver in an attached mode instantiated therefor, the I/O workload using the storage processing logic to send I/O tasks included in the I/O workload to the storage configuration; and initiate, with the logical storage driver, generation of trace data for the I/O workload for analysis to determine whether I/O performance using a default or second storage stack meets performance specifications for the I/O workload.
2. The data storage system as in claim 1, wherein the memory device includes instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the data storage system to determine via analysis of the trace data that use of the storage stack does not meet the performance specifications for the I/O workload.
3. The data storage system as in claim 2, wherein the memory device includes instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the data storage system to identify a second storage stack that meets the performance specifications for the I/O workload.
4. The data storage system as in claim 3, wherein the memory device includes instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the data storage system to synchronize data from a storage component of the storage configuration to a second storage component of a second storage configuration.
5. The data storage system as in claim 3, wherein the memory device includes instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the data storage system to detach the storage processing logic used with the storage configuration from the logical storage driver.
6. The data storage system as in claim 5, wherein the detached mode is configured to forward, with the logical storage driver, I/O workloads to a default storage stack for processing of the I/O workloads.
7. A computer implemented method for processing I/O (input/output) workloads using a logical storage driver, comprising: forwarding, by the logical storage driver in a detached mode, a received I/O workload to a default storage stack for processing of the I/O workload, wherein I/O associated with the I/O workload is passed through the logical storage driver; initiating generation of trace data for the I/O workload for collection and analysis to determine a second storage stack for improving performance of the I/O workload, wherein the second storage stack comprises storage processing logic and a storage configuration defined to handle the I/O workload; receiving the storage processing logic for processing the I/O workload using the storage configuration for the I/O workload, wherein the storage processing logic interfaces with the storage configuration; attaching the storage processing logic according to the second storage stack to the logical storage driver; intercepting, by the logical storage driver in an attached mode instantiated therefor, I/O requests that correspond to the I/O workload; and processing, by the logical storage driver in the attached mode, the I/O workload using the storage processing logic that interfaces with the storage configuration.
8. The method as in claim 7, wherein the storage processing logic sends I/O tasks included in the I/O workload to the storage configuration.
9. The method as in claim 7, wherein the storage configuration includes at least a data storage driver and a data storage device.
10. The method as in claim 7, wherein determining the second storage stack used to improve the performance of the I/O workload includes using QoS (quality of service) specifications to determine the storage configuration.
