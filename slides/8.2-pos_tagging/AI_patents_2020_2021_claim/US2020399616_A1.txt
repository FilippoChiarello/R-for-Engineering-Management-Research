ENGINEERED IMINE REDUCTASES AND METHODS FOR THE REDUCTIVE AMINATION OF KETONE AND AMINE COMPOUNDS
</title>

<abstract>
The present application provides engineered polypeptides having imine reductase activity, polynucleotides encoding the engineered imine reductases, host cells capable of expressing the engineered imine reductases, and methods of using these engineered polypeptides with a range of ketone and amine substrate compounds to prepare secondary and tertiary amine product compounds.
