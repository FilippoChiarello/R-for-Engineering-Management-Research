DATA DRIVEN SYSTEMS AND METHODS TO ISOLATE NETWORK FAULTS
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems and computer readable media for isolating network faults are provided. A data driven automation services module is provided Including a data connector, a data driven policy designer and a data driven self-service engine. The data connector collects data from the plurality of network data sources and integrates the data into shared communities for insight development. The data driven policy designer creates and stores templates and develops policies to implement service tasks to identify and isolate network problems. The data driven self-service engine integrates the network and its orchestration capabilities with big data technology to develop a plurality of microservices to perform service tasks.

<claims>
1. A system for identifying and isolating a network problem comprising: a network having a plurality of network data sources; an orchestration platform coupled to the network and providing orchestration capabilities, the orchestration platform comprising: a data driven automation services module comprising: a data connector that collects data from the plurality of network data sources and integrates the data into shared communities for insight development; a data driven policy designer capable of creating and storing templates and developing policies to implement service tasks to identify and isolate the network problem; and a data driven self-service engine that integrates the network and the orchestration capabilities with big data technology to develop a plurality of microservices to perform the service tasks.
2. The system of claim 1 wherein the data driven policy designer uses machine learning to develop the policies.
3. The system of claim 1 wherein the plurality of microservices comprises a plurality of reusable microservices.
4. The system of claim 1 wherein the data collected from a plurality of data sources comprises alarms.
5. The system of claim 1 wherein the data connector collects service chain data to identify transport types and network components.
6. The system of claim 1 wherein the data driven policy designer uses or creates policies to identify root causes of the network problems.
7. The system of claim 1 wherein the plurality of microservices are powered by machine learning or artificial intelligence and are available to be used by the shared communities.
8. A method for identifying and isolating network problems comprising: collecting data from a plurality of network sources in a data connector; integrating the data into shared communities for insight development; accessing a data driven policy designer to develop policies to fulfill a plurality of service tasks; and accessing a data driven self-service engine to determine if there is an appropriate microservice from a plurality of microservices capable of performing a selected service task from the plurality of service tasks.
9. The method of claim 8 wherein the data driven policy designer develops policies to fulfill service tasks originated from fault-driven VNF orchestration, order-driven VNF orchestration and infrastructure VNF orchestration.
10. The method of claim 8 wherein accessing the data driven self-service engine to determine if there is the appropriate microservice from the plurality of microservices comprises scanning a catalog of microservices storing the plurality of microservices to identify a reusable microservice from the plurality of microservices.
11. The method of claim 8 wherein if the appropriate microservice is available to perform the selected service task then executing the appropriate microservice.
12. The method of claim 8 wherein if the appropriate microservice is not available to perform the selected service task then developing a new microservice to perform the selected service task.
13. The method of claim 8 further comprising executing the selected service task.
14. The method of claim 8 wherein the data comprises data movement as a platform events related to network equipment and facility alarms.
15. A non-transitory computer readable storage medium having computer-executable instructions that, when executed, cause a computer system to: collect data from a plurality of network sources in a data connector; integrating the data into shared communities for insight development; access a data driven policy designer to develop policies to fulfill a plurality of service tasks; and access a data driven self-service engine to determine if there is an appropriate microservice from a plurality of microservices capable of performing a selected service task from the plurality of service tasks.
16. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 15 wherein the computer-executable instructions further comprise instructions to develops policies to fulfill service tasks originated from fault-driven VNF orchestration, order-driven VNF orchestration and infrastructure VNF orchestration in the data driven policy designer.
17. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 15 wherein the computer-executable instructions further comprise instructions to scan a catalog of microservices storing the plurality of microservices to identify a reusable microservice from the plurality of microservices.
18. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 15 wherein the computer-executable instructions further comprise instruction to execute the appropriate microservice if there is a reusable microservice available to perform the selected service task.
19. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 15 wherein the computer-executable instructions further comprise instruction to develop a new microservice to perform the selected service task if the appropriate microservice is not available to perform the selected service task.
20. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 15 wherein the computer-executable instructions further comprise instruction to execute the selected service task.
