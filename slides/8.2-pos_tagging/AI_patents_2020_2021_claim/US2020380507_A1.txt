VIRTUAL FINANCIAL CONTINUITY VIA AN AI-BASED SIMULACRUM
</title>

<abstract>
In one or more embodiments, a method, system and computer program product provide automating performance of a pattern of financial transactions by analyzing a pattern of financial transactions performed by a human operator. A predictive model is developed for a response by the human operator to a future financial transaction opportunity based on the analyzed pattern of financial transactions. At least one of: (i) a sensor in proximity to the human operator and (ii) a communication channel used by the human operator is monitored to detect a triggering event. The triggering event indicates authorization for an automated response in lieu of the response by the human operator to the future financial transaction opportunity. The automated response is performed to complete the future financial transaction in response to the triggering event.

<claims>
1. A method for automating performance of a pattern of financial transactions, comprising: determining a pattern of financial behavior performed by a human operator by analyzing financial transactions performed by the human operator, wherein the pattern indicates at least one triggering event and context around the at least one triggering event and wherein the pattern is not a periodic transaction; developing a predictive model for a response by the human operator to a future financial transaction opportunity based on the analyzed pattern of financial transactions; detecting a first contextual triggering event by a sensor in proximity to the human operator indicating authorization for an automated response in lieu of the response by the human operator to the future financial transaction opportunity, wherein the authorization is based on context determined by the sensor; detecting a second contextual triggering event by a communication channel used by the human operator indicating authorization for the automated response in lieu of the response by the human operator to the future financial transaction opportunity, wherein the authorization is based on context determined from the communication channel; and performing the automated response to complete the future financial transaction in response to detecting the first contextual triggering event and the second contextual triggering event, wherein performing the automated response includes a machine-to-human analog to complete the future financial transaction.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein: wherein the sensor detects health information from a health sensor that is indicative of a capacity status of the human operator; and detecting the first contextual triggering event comprises determining whether the health information indicates an incapacity of the human operator to perform the response to the future financial transaction opportunity.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein detecting on the communication channel used by the human operator comprises: establishing a baseline level of communication activity that is indicative of capacity by the human operator to perform the response to the future financial transaction opportunity; and determining whether the human operator is incapacitated based upon detecting the communication activity being below the baseline level for a period of time.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the communication channel used by the human operator comprises monitoring at least one of: (i) a social website; (ii) an email service; and (iii) a messaging service.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein: developing the predictive model comprises categorizing responses by the human operator to respective financial transaction opportunities into at least two or more of the following categories: (i) recurring payment of a billed amount; (ii) a recurring partial debt payment correlated to a minimum payment amount; (iii) a recurring money transfer amount to a selected recipient; and (iv) a non-recurring financial transaction; and wherein performing the automated response is contingent upon the financial transaction opportunity being a recurring event that is categorized in the predictive model.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: wherein detecting the second contextual triggering event includes determining that the capacity of the human operator is a temporary unavailability based on a calendar function; and in response to determining that the human operator is temporarily unavailable, performing the automated response in response to determining that the predictive model indicates that a response by the human operator is overdue.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein determining that the capacity of the human operator is temporary unavailability comprises: monitoring a calendar function of a productivity system; and detecting a travel schedule of the human operator that is posted in the calendar function.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining that the capacity of the human operator is permanently unavailable to perform the response; and in response to determining that the human operator is permanently unavailable: accessing an assignment of a fiducial operator for the human operator; and reporting a recommendation for the automated response to the fiducial operator.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising performing an interactive training period for developing the predict model by: detecting the financial transaction opportunity based at least in part on one of: (i) receiving a billing prompt; and (ii) determining a due date for a recurring financial transaction; based on currently analyzed financial transactions, presenting one or more recommendations as a respective control affordance on a user interface to the human operator for responding to the financial transaction operator; and performing an automated response that is consistent with a received activation of a control affordance.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising: tracking one or more automated responses; and reporting the tracked one or more automated responses to a user interface.
11. The method of claim 1, further comprising: detecting a financial transaction opportunity comprising receipt of a nonrecurring asset; and determining a recommendation for transferal of the nonrecurring asset based on a prioritization indication contained in the predictive model.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine-to-human analog comprises: developing the predictive model comprises determining that the response by the human operator to financial transaction was performed by a human-to-human interaction; and performing the automated response comprises: accessing at least one machine-accessible contact address to the recipient of the future financial transaction opportunity; determining the machine-to-human analog for the human-to-human interaction; and performing the machine-to-human analog.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the machine-to-human analog comprises one of: (i) an interactive voice recognition telephone communication; (ii) an email message; (iii) an electronic funds transfer; and (iv) an automated check printing and mailing service.
14. A system comprising: a transaction analyzing component that determines a pattern of financial behavior performed by a human operator by analyzing financial transactions performed by the human operator, wherein the pattern indicates at least one triggering event and context around the at least one triggering event and wherein the pattern is not a periodic transaction; a simulacrum engine that develops a predictive model for a response by the human operator to a future financial transaction opportunity based on the analyzed pattern of financial transactions by the transaction analyzing component; a communication component that detects: (i) a first contextual triggering event by a sensor in proximity to the human operator indicating authorization for an automated response in lieu of the response by the human operator to the future financial transaction opportunity, wherein the authorization is based on the context, wherein the triggering event is not customer-initiated and (ii) a second contextual triggering event by a communication channel used by the human operator indicating authorization for an automated response in lieu of the response by the human operator to the future financial transaction opportunity, wherein the authorization is based on the context, wherein the triggering event is not expressly initiated by a human; and a simulacrum avatar that performs the automated response to complete the future financial transaction in response to the triggering event, wherein performing the automated response includes a machine-to-human analog to complete the future financial transaction.
15.
