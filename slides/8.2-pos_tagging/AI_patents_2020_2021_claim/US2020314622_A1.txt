<title>
BEAM AS A SERVICE FOR 5G OR OTHER NEXT GENERATION NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
A radio access network intelligent controller (RIC) platform can enable various highly secure, reliable, fast communications for first responders during emergency situations. Self-organizing service chaining of public safety edge applications, can be enabled in both time and space when triggered by an emergency situation. The RIC platform can perform reassignment of resources and network slices according to historical data and situational analysis. The RIC platform can select and provide the best frequencies and resources to ensure that first responders have communication services that do not get affected by anomalies such as network load, congestion, and/or related degradations.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: receiving, by network equipment comprising a processor and from a user equipment, a first request for a resource associated with an emergency communication; in response to receiving the first request, authenticating, by the network equipment, the user equipment for the emergency communication; based on authenticating the user equipment, tagging, by the network equipment, the first request with a priority value associated with the resource; and in response to tagging the first request, transmitting, by the network equipment, the resource to the user equipment; and receiving, by the network equipment, a second request for a drone device to be dispatched to capture video.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the resource is a bandwidth associated with the emergency communication.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the request for the resource is received via a secured application program interface operable on the user equipment.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: establishing, by the network equipment, a control signal with the user equipment for a duration of the emergency communication.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving, by the network equipment, an indication that the emergency communication has been terminated.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: in response to transmitting the resource to the user equipment, facilitating, by the network equipment, a dispatch of the drone device to a location associated with the user equipment.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising: in response to the dispatch of the drone device, allocating, by the network equipment, the resource to the drone device.
8. Network equipment, comprising: a processor; and a memory that stores executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: receiving, from a user equipment, a first request for a resource associated with an emergency communication; in response to receiving the first request, authenticating the user equipment for communication with the network equipment; in response to authenticating the user equipment, configuring the resource for the emergency communication of the user equipment; in response to configuring the resource, sending the resource to the user equipment; and receiving a second request for a drone device to be dispatched to capture video.
9. The network equipment of claim 8, wherein configuring the resource comprises tagging the resource with tag data representative of the resource being associated with the emergency communication.
10. The network equipment of claim 9, wherein the operations further comprise: in response to tagging the resource with the tag data, splitting the resource in accordance with a priority associated with the emergency communication.
11. The network equipment of claim 8, wherein the network equipment is a first network equipment, and wherein the operations further comprise: in response to authenticating the user equipment for the communication, facilitating a handoff of the communication to a second network equipment.
12. The network equipment of claim 8, wherein the operations further comprise: in response to authenticating the user equipment for the communication with the network equipment, monitoring the communication in accordance with a service level agreement.
13. The network equipment of claim 8, wherein the operations further comprise: analyzing historical communications between the network equipment and the user equipment via a machine learning process.
14. The network equipment of claim 8, wherein the operations further comprise: receiving an indication that the emergency communication has been determined to have been terminated.
15. The network equipment of claim 14, wherein the operations further comprise: in response to receiving the indication that the emergency communication has been determined to have been terminated, releasing the resource from being allocated to the user equipment.
16. A non-transitory machine-readable storage medium, comprising executable instructions that, when executed by a processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: receiving a first request for a resource associated with an emergency communication from a mobile device of a network; in response to receiving the first request, facilitating authenticating the mobile device for communication with a network equipment of the network; in response to facilitating the authenticating the mobile device, facilitating configuring the resource for the emergency communication; in response to facilitating of the configuring the resource, facilitating assigning the resource to the mobile device for a duration of the emergency communication; and receiving a second request for a drone device to be dispatched to capture video of an area associated with the emergency communication.
17. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 16, wherein facilitating the assigning the resource is performed in accordance with a service level agreement associated with the network.
18. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 16, wherein the operations further comprise: in response to the emergency communication being determined to have been terminated, facilitating releasing the resource from the mobile device.
19. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 18, wherein the mobile device is a first mobile device, and wherein the operations further comprise: in response to facilitating the releasing the resource from the first mobile device, facilitating assigning the resource to a second mobile device.
20. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 19, wherein the emergency communication is a first emergency communication, and wherein the resource is assigned to the second mobile device for a second emergency communication different than the first emergency communication.
