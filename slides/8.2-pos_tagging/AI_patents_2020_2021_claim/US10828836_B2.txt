<title>
Method for melt pool monitoring
</title>

<abstract>
A method of controlling an additive manufacturing process in which a directed energy source is used to selectively melt material to form a workpiece, forming a melt pool in the process of melting, the method including: using an imaging apparatus to generate an image of the melt pool comprising an array of individual image elements, the image including a measurement of at least one physical property for each of the individual image elements; from the measurements, mapping a melt pool boundary of the melt pool; and controlling at least one aspect of the additive manufacturing process with reference to the melt pool boundary.

<claims>
1. A method of controlling an additive manufacturing process in which a directed energy source is used to selectively melt material to form a workpiece, forming a melt pool in the process of melting, the method comprising: using an imaging apparatus to generate an image of the melt pool comprising an array of individual image elements, the image including a measurement of at least one physical property for each of the individual image elements; from the measurements, mapping a melt pool boundary of the melt pool, wherein for each of the measurements that match a threshold value, the corresponding image elements are defined to constitute a portion of the melt pool boundary, and wherein for each of the measurements that are less than the threshold value, the corresponding image elements are defined to constitute a location outside of the melt pool boundary, and further wherein for each of the measurements that are greater than the threshold value, the corresponding image elements are defined to constitute a location inside the melt pool boundary; and controlling at least one aspect of the additive manufacturing process with reference to the melt pool boundary.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the measurement for each of the image elements includes at least one scalar value.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the measurement for each of the image elements includes 3-D information.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein the step of mapping the boundary of the melt pool includes: establishing the threshold value; and comparing the measurement for each of the image elements to the threshold value.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the threshold value is a range having predetermined upper and lower boundaries.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising comparing the melt pool boundary to a template boundary of a melt pool template.
7. The method of claim 6 wherein the step of controlling includes taking a discrete action in response to the comparison exceeding one or more predetermined melt pool limits.
8. The method of claim 7 wherein the discrete action is stopping the additive manufacturing process.
9. The method of claim 7 wherein the discrete action is providing a visual or audible alarm to a local or remote operator.
10. The method of claim 1 wherein the step of controlling includes changing at least one process parameter of the additive manufacturing process.
11. The method of claim 10 wherein the controlled process parameter includes at least one of: directed energy source power level and beam scan velocity.
12. A method of making a workpiece, comprising: depositing a material in a build chamber; directing a build beam from a directed energy source to selectively fuse the material in a pattern corresponding to a cross-sectional layer of the workpiece, wherein a melt pool is formed by the directed energy source; using an imaging apparatus to generate an image of the melt pool comprising an array of individual image elements, the image including a measurement of at least one physical property for each of the individual image elements; from the measurements, mapping a melt pool boundary of the melt pool, wherein for each of the measurements that match a threshold value, the corresponding image elements are defined to constitute a portion of the melt pool boundary, and wherein for each of the measurements that are less than the threshold value, the corresponding image elements are defined to constitute a location outside of the melt pool boundary, and further wherein for each of the measurements that are greater than the threshold value, the corresponding image elements are defined to constitute a location inside the melt pool boundary; and controlling at least one aspect of making the workpiece with reference to the mapped boundary.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising repeating in a cycle the steps of depositing and fusing to build up the workpiece in a layer-by layer fashion.
14. The method of claim 12, wherein the measurement for each of the image elements includes at least one scalar value.
15. The method of claim 12, wherein the measurement for each of the image elements includes 3-D information.
16. The method of claim 12 wherein the step of mapping the boundary of the melt pool includes: establishing the threshold value; comparing the measurement for each of the image elements to the threshold value.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the threshold value is a range having predetermined upper and lower boundaries.
18. The method of claim 12, further comprising comparing the melt pool boundary to a template boundary of a melt pool template.
19. The method of claim 18 wherein the step of controlling includes taking a discrete action in response to the comparison exceeding one or more predetermined melt pool limits.
20. The method of claim 12 wherein the step of controlling includes changing at least one process parameter of the additive manufacturing process.
