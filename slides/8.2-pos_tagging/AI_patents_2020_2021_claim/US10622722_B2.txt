System and method for launching guided electromagnetic waves with impedance matching
</title>

<abstract>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, a system includes an impedance matching circuit that includes one or more adjustable circuit elements, wherein the impedance matching circuit receives an input signal and generates an output signal in response to the input signal. A guided wave launcher is configured to generate, in response to the output signal, a first guided electromagnetic wave along a surface of a transmission medium, wherein the first guided electromagnetic wave propagates along the surface of the transmission medium without requiring an electrical return path. A controller is configured to generate one or more control signals in response to a channel quality indicator, wherein the one or more control signals adjust the one or more adjustable circuit elements of the impedance matching circuit, wherein adjustment of the one or more adjustable circuit elements facilitates reducing an impedance mismatch of the guided wave launcher.
