<title>
BLADE SENTENCING
</title>

<abstract>
A method of sentencing, accepting or rejecting, a cast component is disclosed. Initially, scanning the component to determine a number of datum points; this can be done using optical scanning techniques. The datum points from the scanned results are then aligned with an ideal design computer aided design (CAD) model of the component. A comparison of the scanned datum points of the component is performed against the data from the ideal design CAD model of the component, and any geometric deviations between the scan and the ideal design CAD model are determined. Using the datum points from the scan of the component an assessment is performed of at least one performance prediction factor for the component. Finally, using dimensional data extracted from the scan and/or the performance prediction factor the component is sentenced for either acceptance or rejection. Additionally, if the component is determined to have a deviation that lies within a pre-determined limit for the dimensional data and/or the performance factor a determination may be made as to whether the component can be reoriented.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method of sentencing a cast component, the method comprising the steps of: scanning the component to determine a number of datum points; aligning the datum points with an ideal design computer aided design (CAD) model of the component; comparing the scanned datum points of the component with the data from the ideal design CAD model of the component and determining any geometric deviations between the scan and the ideal design CAD model; using dimensional data extracted from the scan of the component to perform an assessment of at least one performance prediction factor for the component; and using the dimensional data extracted from the scan and/or the performance prediction factor to sentence the component for either acceptance or rejection of the component.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein when performing sentencing of the component for acceptance or rejection, if the component is determined to have a deviation that lies within a pre-determined limit for the dimensional data and/or the performance factor a determination is made as to whether the component can be reoriented.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the component is reoriented using a reorientation process, which applies an orientation correction to the cast to compensate for an orientation error.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the scan is performed by an optical scanning technique.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the performance prediction factor is obtained from a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model of the component.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the component is a blade for use in a gas turbine engine.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein if the blade is accepted, a fir tree root profile is machined on to the root of the blade.
8. The method of claim 6, wherein the blade is a high pressure turbine blade.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein a surrogate model is employed in the determination of the performance prediction factor.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein artificial intelligence is employed in the determination of the performance prediction factor.
