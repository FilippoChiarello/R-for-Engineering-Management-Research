SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR LABEL AUGMENTATION IN VIDEO DATA
</title>

<abstract>
A method for processing video data comprising a plurality of image frames, the method comprising: obtaining a forward model and a backward model of the plurality of image frames; processing the forward model and the backward model to propagate at least one label in the region or patch to at least one other image frame of the video sequence, using a probabilistic method for estimating the label in the at least one other image frame in forward and backward correspondences, wherein, during the processing, a pixel having a most likely label with a probability lower than a threshold value is assigned a predetermined generic label; and generating a labelled result for any given image frame by applying an image label difference, based on label uncertainty between the forward and backward correspondences, to the given image frame.

<claims>
1. A method for processing video data comprising a plurality of image frames, the plurality of image frames having an earlier frame and a later frame of a video sequence, and having a label for a region or patch in the earlier frame and a corresponding region or patch in the later frame, the method comprising: obtaining a forward model and a backward model of the plurality of image frames; processing the forward model and the backward model to propagate at least one label in the region or patch to at least one other image frame of the video sequence, using a probabilistic method for estimating the label in the at least one other image frame in forward and backward correspondences, wherein, during the processing, a pixel having a most likely label with a probability lower than a threshold value is assigned a predetermined generic label; and generating a labelled result for any given image frame by applying an image label difference, based on label uncertainty between the forward and backward correspondences, to the given image frame.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the propagated label is a class label.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the propagated label is an instance label.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein the plurality of image frames have a pixel resolution greater than or equal to 960Ã—720.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the forward and backward models comprise a probabilistic graphical model.
6. The method according to claim 3, comprising: after the processing, assigning pixels within an image frame having no instance label to a background class; dilating the pixels of the background class surrounded by pixels having an assigned instance label into a group of pixels; and reassigning the assigned instance label to the group of pixels when the group of pixels is smaller than a threshold size.
7. The method according to claim 6, wherein the threshold size is 40 pixels, better 30 pixels, still better 20 pixels.
8. The method according to claim 7, wherein the video sequence is a 360 degree video sequence.
9. The method according to claim 8, wherein the 360 degree video sequence is stored as equirectangular images.
10. A method for processing video data comprising a plurality of image frames, the plurality of image frames having an earlier frame and a later frame of a video sequence, and having a label for a region or patch in the earlier frame and a corresponding region or patch in the later frame, the method comprising: obtaining a forward model and a backward model of the plurality of image frames; processing the forward model and the backward model to propagate at least one label in the region or patch to at least one other image frame of the video sequence, using a probabilistic method for estimating the label in the at least one other image frame in forward and backward correspondences, wherein, during the processing, a pixel having a most likely label with a probability lower than a threshold value is assigned a predetermined generic label; generating a labelled result for any given image frame by applying an image label difference, based on label uncertainty between the forward and backward correspondences, to the given image frame; and using the labelled result image frames for training an image classifier.
11. A system for processing video data comprising a plurality of image frames, the plurality of image frames having an earlier frame and a later frame of a video sequence, having a label for a region or patch in the earlier frame and a corresponding region or patch in the later frame, the system comprising: storage means storing a forward model of the plurality of image frames and a backward model of the plurality of image frames; processing means for applying the model to propagate at least one label of the region or patch to at least one other image frame of the video sequence, using a probabilistic method for estimating the label in the at least one other image frame in forward and backward correspondences, wherein the processing means is configured to assign a void label to a pixel having a most likely label with a probability lower than a threshold value; and correcting means for generating a labelled result for any given image frame by applying an image label difference, based on label uncertainty between the forward and backward correspondences, to the given image frame.
12. The system according to claim 11, wherein the forward model and the backward model are probabilistic graphical models.
13. The system according to claim 11, comprising post-processing means is configured to assign pixels within an image frame having no instance label to a background class, dilate the pixels of the background class surrounded by pixels having an assigned instance label into a group of pixels, and reassigning the assigned instance label to the group of pixels when the group of pixels is smaller than a threshold size.
