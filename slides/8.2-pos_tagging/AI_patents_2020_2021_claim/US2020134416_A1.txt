SYSTEM-ON-A-CHIP INCORPORATING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK AND GENERAL-PURPOSE PROCESSOR CIRCUITRY
</title>

<abstract>
A circuit system and a method of analyzing audio or video input data that is capable of detecting, classifying, and post-processing patterns in an input data stream. The circuit system may consist of one or more digital processors, one or more configurable spiking neural network circuits, and digital logic for the selection of two-dimensional input data. The system may use the neural network circuits for detecting and classifying patterns and one or more the digital processors to perform further detailed analyses on the input data and for signaling the result of an analysis to outputs of the system.
