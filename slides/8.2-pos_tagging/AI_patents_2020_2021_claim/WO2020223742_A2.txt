<title>
GENERATION AND OPERATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED CONVERSATION SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
A computer process provide for users employing a conversation program to dynamically program automated assistants with information and processes that can later be invoked to accomplish task(s) on one or more of the users' devices. The conversation program might generate an automated assistant from a text or graphic source. The conversation program might access multiple automated assistants and determine which is most appropriate to use in order to address a user's request. The user can generate avatars for the conversation program that parallel human emotion, facial expression and body gestures that can be displayed in visual context. A resulting automated assistant can be used for software system testing.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for generating a conversation system, comprising:
under the control of one or more computer systems configured with executable
instructions:
prompting an authoring user to select a selected knowledge domain from a set of one or more knowledge domains;
receiving the authoring user's selection of the selected knowledge domain;
receiving authoring user input from the authoring user; and
converting the authoring user input into a plurality of text outputs in a structured form, usable by an authored automated integration system.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
converting the authoring user input into a plurality of text outputs, wherein a first text output is a first output of a first recognition system and a second text output is a second output of a second recognition system;
creating a domain-specific plan based on a domain specification of the selected
knowledge domain;
obtaining a run-time specification, the run-time specification comprising a plan task flow configured for the selected knowledge domain and based on the domainspecific plan;
executing the plan task flow;
generating input values from the user input;
improving the conversation system based on the input values; and
storing a representation of the conversation system in computer-readable memory.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the input from the authoring user comprises a voice input or a text input.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the first recognition system and the second recognition system are one or more of an automated speech recognition system or an image recognition system.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising dynamically revising the plan task flow using the reasoning module and based upon input from an interacting user interacting with the conversation system.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
obtaining, from the authoring user, a first authoring user selection of a selected option from among a first set of one or more first options;
adjusting the plan task flow based on the first authoring user selection; and creating a stored domain knowledge repository using a data mining module.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the data mining module uses one or more of structured text, unstructured text, and/or graphics, and computations of the data mining module alters outputs of the conversation system.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the domain-specific plan is generated using an automated domain knowledge source module with a crowd-sourced knowledge source ranking system, the method further comprising:
deriving a scoring value for each of a plurality of knowledge sources;
using the automated domain knowledge source module to dynamically determine a selected source to use from among a plurality of sources based on the scoring values; and
mapping the selected source to an output value of the conversation system.
9. A system for a dynamically improving a conversation program based on user input, the system comprising:
one or more processors; and
a non-transitory computer readable medium storing a plurality of instructions, which when executed, cause the one or more processors to:
a) form an intent based on a user input;
b) create a plan based on the intent, wherein the plan comprises a first action object that transforms a first concept object associated with the intent into a second concept object and comprises a second action object that transforms the second concept object into a third concept object associated with a goal of the intent, wherein the first action object and the second action object are selected from a plurality of action objects, and wherein the first action object is provided by a first third-party developer and the second action object is provided by a second third-party developer;
c) execute the plan, and
d) output a value associated with the third concept object.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the first concept object is provided by a third third-party developer, the second concept object is provided by a fourth third-party developer, and the third concept object is provided by a fifth third-party developer.
11. The system of claim 9, wherein the first concept object comprises first data which provides instantiations of the first concept object, the second concept object comprises second data which provides instantiations of the second concept object, and the third concept object comprises third data which provides instantiations of the third concept object.
12. The system of claim 9, wherein an input parameter of the first action object is mapped to a web service parameter and a web service result is mapped to an output value of the first action object.
