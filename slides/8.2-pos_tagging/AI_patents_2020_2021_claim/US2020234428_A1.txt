<title>
Methods And Systems For Inspection Of Semiconductor Structures With Automatically Generated Defect Features
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems for improved detection and classification of defects of interest (DOI) is realized based on values of one or more automatically generated attributes derived from images of a candidate defect. Automatically generated attributes are determined by iteratively training, reducing, and retraining a deep learning model. The deep learning model relates optical images of candidate defects to a known classification of those defects. After model reduction, attributes of the reduced model are identified which strongly relate the optical images of candidate defects to the known classification of the defects. The reduced model is subsequently employed to generate values of the identified attributes associated with images of candidate defects having unknown classification. In another aspect, a statistical classifier is employed to classify defects based on automatically generated attributes and attributes identified manually.
