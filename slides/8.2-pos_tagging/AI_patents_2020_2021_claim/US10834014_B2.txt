4. The system as in claim 3, wherein the platform, comprising at least in part one or more standardized specifications and/or resources, enables dynamic arrangement of the synergistic resource group components, where the components operate in accordance with stakeholder rule sets enforced by respective coherence services, the rules enforced in accordance with stakeholder cooperation specifications and integration agreements, where the rules form operating contract relationships between stakeholder parties and the rules at least in part operate in accordance with stakeholder seniority of authority.
5. A method for establishing a user purpose fulfillment computing platform, the method comprising: using a hardware and software computing arrangement, comprising at least in part at least one hardware processor, at least one memory space, and at least one communications means, for providing a user purpose fulfillment computing platform, wherein the platform comprises, at least in part, one or more standardized specifications and/or resources that enable: a. providing computing arrangement user interface arrangements that enable users to specify respective interoperably interpretable, intended computing arrangement prescriptive usage purpose expressions using an at least in part standardized lexical purpose expression language arrangement, wherein each the expression employs at least one category and at least one stipulated and/or inferred verb; b. identifying purpose fulfillment resource set arrangements, wherein each arrangement comprises a user purpose fulfillment grouping of resources, the identifying performed by the resource set arrangements' respective stakeholder parties; c. curating and publishing the resource set arrangements, wherein one or more stakeholder parties: 1. establish purpose classes and/or other purpose neighborhoods that include resource set arrangements as members of the neighborhoods and where the neighborhoods are at least in part identified by their respective purpose expressions, the neighborhood purpose expressions specified at least in part using the standardized lexical purpose expression language arrangement, 2. express for respective resource set arrangements, descriptive usage purpose specification expressions, the specifications expressed at least in part using the standardized lexical purpose expression language arrangement, and 3. organize the resource set arrangements as members of, and/or otherwise associate the arrangements with, the respective resource purpose classes and/or other purpose neighborhoods, wherein the members' resource set arrangement descriptive usage purpose expressions are respectively consistent with their resource purpose classes', and/or other purpose neighborhoods', purpose expressions; d. performing similarity matching of (a) the users' prescriptive, and (b) respective purpose classes', and/or other purpose neighborhoods', respective descriptive, purpose expressions to identify one or more purpose classes and/or other purpose neighborhoods; and e. further performing user purpose expression similarity matching and/or other user resource set arrangement evaluation operations by respectively comparing user prescriptive purpose expressions to respective descriptive purpose expressions of one or more identified the purpose classes', and/or other purpose neighborhoods', members to identify resource set one or more arrangements whose resource descriptive purpose expression characterizing elements similarity match the user purpose specification one or more elements, wherein a user, using a computing arrangement, can evaluate and/or select one or more purpose class and/or other purpose neighborhood member resource set arrangements, wherein the one or more arrangements' selected respective resources are configured to support user directed unfolding purpose fulfillment respective environments.
