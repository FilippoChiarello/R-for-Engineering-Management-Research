Apparatus and method of monitoring VR sickness prediction model for virtual reality content
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is an apparatus and method of monitoring a VR (Virtual Reality) sickness prediction model for virtual reality content. A method of monitoring a VR sickness prediction model according to the present disclosure includes: displaying the virtual reality content on a display unit; acquiring an user input; analyzing the virtual reality content on a basis of the acquired user input; and displaying an analysis result for the virtual reality content on the display unit.

2. The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the user input further includes an input to select at least one playback time of the virtual reality content, and the controller performs control such that the analysis result for the virtual reality content is displayed on the display unit at a playback section corresponding to the selected at least one playback time.
3. The apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the first data includes at least one of VR sickness inducing-factors of the virtual reality content, a first VR sickness information, a second VR sickness information, and a correlation information between the VR sickness-inducing factors determined in advance via machine learning and a VR sickness list; the VR sickness-inducing factors of the virtual reality content include movement of a camera, movement of an object, playback information, resolution, binocular parallax, depth of field, angle of view, image feature, special effect, and texture effect; the VR sickness list includes at least one of discomfort, fatigue, headache, eye fatigue, difficulties with focusing, sweating, nausea, difficulties with attention, brain fog, visual acuity, dizziness, hallucinations, stomachache, cyber sickness, burping, and other symptoms as VR sickness list items; the first VR sickness information includes at least one of an image of the user acquired from an image capturing sensor and a magnitude of a biological signal of the user acquired from a biological signal detection sensor; and the second VR sickness information is a degree of at least one of the VR sickness list items input from the user in response to the request for inputting the degree of the VR sickness for the virtual reality content.
4. The apparatus according to claim 3, wherein, when the user input is an input selected to display the first data related to the virtual reality content on the display unit, the controller performs control such that the virtual reality content is analyzed, thereby displaying at least one of the VR sickness inducing-factors of the virtual reality content, the first VR sickness information, the second VR sickness information, and the correlation information between the VR sickness-inducing factors determined in advance via machine learning and the VR sickness list, on the display unit.
5. The apparatus according to claim 3, wherein, when the user input is an input selected to display the second data on the display unit, the controller performs control such that at least one of the first data is substituted for one of the VR sickness inducing-factors and a result of the substitution is displayed on the display unit.
6. The apparatus according to claim 3, wherein, when the user input is an input selected to display the simulation result for the virtual reality content on the display unit, the controller performs control such that a value of at least one VR sickness list item in the VR sickness list is changed, and the changed VR sickness list is displayed on the display unit using a graphical user interface (GUI), as the user input is additionally acquired in order to change a value of at least one of the VR sickness-inducing factors.
7. A method of monitoring a VR (Virtual Reality) sickness prediction model for virtual reality content, the method comprising: displaying the virtual reality content on a display unit; acquiring a user input; analyzing the virtual reality content on a basis of the acquired user input; and displaying an analysis result for the virtual reality content on the display unit, wherein the display unit further displays simultaneously each of a viewing screen of a user wearing an HMD (head-mounted display) device, a time line, a monitoring mode, and the analysis result, wherein the virtual reality content includes at least one of a first virtual reality content produced in advance and a second virtual reality content displayed on the HMD device worn by the user as an image corresponding to the first virtual reality content, wherein the user input further includes a first data related to the virtual reality content, a second data acquired by processing the first data, and an input selected so that at least one of a prediction image on the second virtual reality content, and a simulation result on the virtual reality content is displayed on the display unit, wherein, when the user input is an input selected to display the prediction image for the second virtual reality content on the display unit, the control unit performs control such that biological signal or user motion information is predicted on the basis of VR sickness prediction model learned in advance using machine learning based on supervised learning and regression analysis technique and displaying the predicted information on the display unit, and wherein the prediction image on the second virtual reality content comprises the biological signal or the user motion information on the basis of the VR sickness prediction model learned in advance using machine learning.
8. The method according to claim 7, wherein the user input further includes an input to select at least one playback time of the virtual reality content, and the displaying of the analysis result for the virtual reality content on the display unit includes displaying the analysis result for the virtual reality content on the display unit at a playback section corresponding to the selected at least one playback time.
9.
