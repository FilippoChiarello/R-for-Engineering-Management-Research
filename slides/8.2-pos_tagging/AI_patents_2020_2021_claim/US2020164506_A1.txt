SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR A PASSIVE GRASPING SURFACE ON AN ACTIVE GRASPING ROBOTIC MANIPULATOR
</title>

<abstract>
One or more embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to the field of robotic grasping systems, and in particular to an active robotic manipulator that includes a passive grasping component so that the robotic manipulator can grasp a wide variety of objects and simultaneously providing soft grasping features which reduce the risk of damage to objects.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system for a robotic manipulator having an active grasping component that allows for passive grasping of an object, comprising: a controller; at least two fingers configured to provide an active grasp of the object; a passive grasping surface coupled to each of the fingers, wherein each of the passive grasping surfaces includes a deformable shell having an interior containing a medium; an actuator communicatively coupled to the controller, the actuator configured to control movement of the fingers; and a pump communicatively coupled to the controller, the pump configured to deliver fluid pressure to the interior of the shell, the pump further configured to suction fluid from the interior of the shell.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the fluid is selected from a group consisting of a liquid and a gas.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the medium is configured to compress when the pump suctions fluid from the interior of the shell.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the medium is selected from a group consisting of coffee grounds, sand, rice, metal fragments, rubber fragments, sawdust, flour, salt, and rocks.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the medium is selected from a group consisting of polymers, foam, elastomers, and silicone.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to control the actuator and the pump based on learned data generated from a machine learning model that has processed sensor data from the robotic manipulator.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to independently control each of the fingers.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the shell is configured to conform to a shape of the object when the pump suctions fluid from the interior of the shell.
9. A method for grasping an object with a robotic manipulator having fingers that include a passive grasping component: positioning, by a controller, at least two active grasping fingers to be adjacent to the object; instructing, by the controller, a pump to apply negative pressure to an interior of a shell coupled to each of the active grasping fingers, wherein the shell is configured to conform to a shape of the object upon application of the negative pressure; determining, by the controller, if the active grasping fingers are securely grasping the object after the application of negative pressure to the interior of the shell; responsive to determining that the active grasping fingers are securely grasping the object after the application of negative pressure to the interior of the shell, instructing, by the controller, the pump to re-apply negative pressure to the interior of the shell; determining, by the controller, if the active grasping fingers are over-grasping the object after the application of the negative pressure to the interior of the shell; and responsive to determining that the active grasping fingers are over-grasping the object after the application of the negative pressure to the interior of the shell, instructing, by the controller, the pump to apply positive pressure to the interior of the shell.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the interior of the shell contains a medium configured to compress when the pump applies negative pressure to the interior of the shell.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the interior of the shell contains a medium configured to expand when the pump applies positive pressure to the interior of the shell.
12. The method of claim 9, wherein the controller is configured to instruct the pump to apply positive pressure to the shell of only one active grasping finger if the active grasping fingers are over-grasping the object.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein the controller is configured to instruct the pump to apply negative pressure to the shell of only one active grasping finger if the active grasping fingers are not securely grasping the object.
14. The method of claim 9, wherein the shell is made from a material selected from a group consisting of an elastomer, a polymeric material, vinyl, a metal foil, a film, and a woven fabric.
15. A system for a robotic manipulator having an active grasping component that allows for passive grasping of an object, comprising: a controller; at least two fingers configured to provide an active grasp of the object; a deformable shell coupled to each of the fingers, wherein each deformable shell has a hollow interior containing a medium, and wherein each deformable shell has an outer surface configured to contact the object; an actuator communicatively coupled to the controller, the actuator configured to control movement of the fingers; and a pump communicatively coupled to the controller, the pump configured to deliver fluid pressure to the interior of the shell, the pump further configured to suction fluid from the interior of the shell, wherein the controller is configured to simultaneously control the actuator and the pump.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the fluid is selected from a group consisting of a liquid and a gas.
17. The system of claim 15, wherein the medium is selected from a group consisting of polymers, foam, elastomers, and silicone.
18. The system of claim 15, wherein at least one of the fingers includes a narrow distal end configured to allow the robotic manipulator to perform a pinching operation on the object.
19. The system of claim 15, wherein the controller is configured to independently control delivery of fluid pressure and suction to each of the deformable shells.
20. The system of claim 15, wherein the controller is configured to control the actuator and the pump based on learned data generated from a machine learning model that has processed sensor data from the robotic manipulator.
