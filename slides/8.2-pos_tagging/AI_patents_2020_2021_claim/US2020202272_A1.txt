METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR ESTIMATING EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT IN A TARGET METRIC FOR A CONTACT CENTER
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method are presented for estimating expected improvement in a target metric for a contact center. A lift estimation analysis is performed to estimate the benefit the contact center is likely to achieve assuming different agent availability conditions for a specific future time interval. Historic data is extracted over a set time interval and used to create new datasets for training and testing. The historic data comprises interaction data and associated outcomes for the interaction data. A predictive model is constructed and used to analyze the test dataset by predicting an outcome score for a target metric and estimating an expected lift.

<claims>
1. A method of estimating expected improvement in a target metric of a contact center, the method comprising: extracting a first dataset over a set time interval from a database associated with the contact center, wherein the dataset comprises: a plurality of past interaction data between customers and agents of the contact center, associated outcomes for the interaction data, and future availability of agents from the past interaction data; creating a second dataset from the first dataset, wherein the second dataset comprises a training dataset and a test dataset; building, by a predictor training server, a predictive model using the training dataset wherein the predictor training server applies a machine-learning algorithm which seeks to minimize the error in difference between true outcome for a target metric of a given interaction and a predicted outcome of the given interaction; analyzing, by an analytics server, the test dataset using the predictive model by predicting an outcome score for the target metric for an interaction handled by an agent from a pool of the agents available in the future; estimating the expected improvement for the target metric when each interaction is handled by an agent meeting a threshold for the outcome score; and generating, by the analytics server, a visual representation comprising the outcome score for the target metric and the expected improvement.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the associated outcomes for the interaction data comprise customer satisfaction survey results.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the associated outcomes for the interaction data comprise customer satisfaction survey results.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the test dataset comprises a most recent percentage of the first dataset as measured by time over the set time interval and the training dataset comprises a remainder of the first dataset.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the most recent percentage is 20% and the remainder is 80%.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the future availability of agents from the past interaction data comprises a set percentage of a number of the available agents for the contact center.
