<title>
System and method for enhanced data analysis with specialized video enabled software tools for medical environments
</title>

<abstract>
Medical software tools platforms utilize a surgical display to provide access to specific medical software tools, such as medically-oriented applications or widgets, that can assist surgeons or surgical team in performing various procedures. In particular, an endoscopic camera may register the momentary rise in the optical signature reflected from a tissue surface and in turn transmit it to a medical image processing system which can also receive patient heart rate data and display relevant anomalies. Changes in various spectral components and the speed at which they change in relation to a source of stimulus (heartbeat, breathing, light source modulation, etc.) may indicate the arrival of blood, contrast agents or oxygen absorption. Combinations of these may indicate various states of differing disease or margins of tumors, and so forth. Also, changes in temperatures, physical dimensions, pressures, photoacoustic pressures and the rate of change may indicate tissue anomalies in comparison to historic values.

<claims>
1. A system for medical software tools, comprising: an image stream interface module configured to receive an image stream from a surgical camera wherein said image stream interface module includes a CPU and a GPU for processing said image stream; a user interface overlay module configured to provide a user interface overlay adapted for presentation over the image stream by use of a video router providing a video stream to overlay an original video image; an optical sensor located corresponding with said surgical camera for registering momentary changes in spectral characteristics reflected from a tissue surface under inspection wherein said optical sensor provides a signal indicative of light energy detected; a medical software tools module configured to provide a medical software tool through the user interface, the medical software tool being configured to perform an operation with respect to the image stream and provide an output adapted to be presented over the image stream, responsive to said light energy detected by said optical sensor in the assessment of the perfusion of tissues and organs; a medical image processing system for processing patient medical data and corresponding said patient medical data with said momentary changes in spectral characteristics for generating optical signature data indicative of various patient conditions, wherein the medical software tool measures: a. changes in color intensity and b. rates at which said color intensities change in response to: heartbeat pushed blood, breathing pushed oxygen or light intensity or modulation from a light source; and wherein said image processing system comprising at least one graphical processing unit connected to at least one central processing unit, and at least one field programmable gate array, and at least one field programmable gate array, and wherein said image processing system is further capable of simultaneously processing raw data through a series of programmed algorithms.
2. A system according to claim 1 wherein said light source is sufficient to generate a gain in temperature of said tissue surface and wherein said temperature gain produces a measurable pressure change which corresponds to a photoacoustic response.
3. A system according to claim 1 wherein tumor margins may be detected by comparing historic said patient medical data to determine which margins correspond to diseased tissue versus which margins correspond to non-diseased tissue.
4. A system according to claim 1 wherein heights of various tissue features are compared with heights of other tissue features associated with said patient medical data in order to determine which of said heights correspond with diseased tissue versus which of said heights correspond with non-diseased tissue.
