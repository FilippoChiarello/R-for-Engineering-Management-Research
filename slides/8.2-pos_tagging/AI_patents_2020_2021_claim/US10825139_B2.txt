<title>
Apparatuses and methods for performing artificial intelligence encoding and artificial intelligence decoding on image
</title>

<abstract>
An artificial intelligence (AI) decoding apparatus includes a memory storing one or more instructions, and a processor configured to execute the stored one or more instructions, to obtain image data corresponding to a first image that is encoded, obtain a second image corresponding to the first image by decoding the obtained image data, determine whether to perform AI up-scaling of the obtained second image, based on the AI up-scaling of the obtained second image being determined to be performed, obtain a third image by performing the AI up-scaling of the obtained second image through an up-scaling deep neural network (DNN), and output the obtained third image, and based on the AI up-scaling of the obtained second image being determined to be not performed, output the obtained second image.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A server for providing an image using an artificial intelligence (AI), the server comprising: one or more processors configured to execute one or more instructions stored in the server, to: determine whether to perform AI down-scaling on an original image; based on the AI down-scaling on the original image being determined to be performed, select first neural network (NN) setting information from a plurality of first NN setting information that is pre-stored in the server; obtain, by a down-scaling NN, a first image by performing the AI down-scaling on the original image, the down-scaling NN being set with the selected first NN setting information; obtain image data by encoding the obtained first image; and transmit, to an electronic device, the image data and AI data related to the AI down-scaling, the AI data comprising at least one of a bitrate of the image data or a codec type applied to the encoding, and being used to select second NN setting information from a plurality of second NN setting information that is pre-stored in the electronic device, wherein each of the plurality of first NN setting information that is pre-stored in the server and each of the plurality of second NN setting information that is pre-stored in the electronic device are obtained through joint training of the down-scaling NN and an up-scaling NN that is used to perform an AI up-scaling of a second image corresponding to the image data.
2. The server of claim 1, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to execute the one or more instructions to determine whether to perform the AI down-scaling on the original image, based on any one or any combination of a resolution of the original image, a type of the original image, and a type of an object included in the original image.
3. The server of claim 1, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to execute the one or more instructions to: verify whether the down-scaling NN is available; and based on the down-scaling NN being verified to be available, determine to perform the AI down-scaling on the original image.
4. The server of claim 3, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to execute the one or more instructions to verify that the down-scaling NN is not available when the down-scaling NN is not stored in the server or when the first NN setting information to be set to the down-scaling NN is not stored in the server.
5. The server of claim 3, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to execute the one or more instructions to verify that the down-scaling NN is not available when a version of at least one of the down-scaling NN or the first NN setting information to be set to the down-scaling NN is not the latest version.
6. The server of claim 1, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to execute the one or more instructions to determine a down-scale target of the original image when it is determined to perform the AI down-scaling on the original image.
7. The server of claim 6, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to execute the stored one or more instructions to select the first NN setting information corresponding to the determined down-scale target from the plurality of first NN setting information pre-stored in the server.
8. A method for providing an image by a server configured to use an artificial intelligence (AI), the method comprising: determining whether to perform AI down-scaling on an original image; based on the AI down-scaling on the original image being determined to be performed, selecting first neural network (NN) setting information from a plurality of first NN setting information that is pre-stored in the server; obtaining, by a down-scaling NN, a first image by performing the AI down-scaling on the original image; obtaining image data by encoding the obtained first image; and transmitting, to an electronic device, the image data and AI data related to the AI down-scaling, the AI data comprising at least one of a bitrate of the image data or a codec type applied to the encoding, and being used to select second NN setting information from a plurality of second NN setting information that is pre-stored in the electronic device, wherein each of the plurality of first NN setting information that is pre-stored in the server and each of the plurality of second NN setting information that is pre-stored in the electronic device are obtained through joint training of the down-scaling NN and an up-scaling NN that is used to perform an AI up-scaling on a second image corresponding to the image data.
