<title>
INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) REAL-TIME RESPONSE TO DEFINED SYMPTOMS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, computer-implemented methods and/or computer program products that facilitate real-time response to defined symptoms are provided. In one embodiment, a computer-implemented method comprises: monitoring, by a system operatively coupled to a processor, a state of an entity; detecting, by the system, defined symptoms of the entity by analyzing the state of the entity; and transmitting, by the system, a signal that causes audio response or a haptic response to be provided to the entity, wherein transmission of the signal that causes the audio response or the haptic response is based on detection of the defined symptoms.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system, comprising: a memory that stores computer executable components; a processor, operably coupled to the memory, and that executes the computer executable components stored in the memory, wherein the computer executable components comprise: one or more sensors that monitor a state of an entity; a machine learning component that detects defined symptoms of the entity by analyzing the state of the entity; and a response component that transmits a signal that causes audio response or a haptic response to be provided to the entity, wherein transmission of the signal that causes the audio response or the haptic response is based on detection of the defined symptoms.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising an audio component that outputs the audio response, wherein the audio response is a breathing exercise, music or heartbeat sound.
3. The system of claim 1, further comprising a haptic component that provides the haptic response, wherein the haptic response is a shoulder massage or back massage.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the audio response or the haptic response are generated at a time period less than 1 minute from time of the detection of the defined symptoms.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the response component changes the audio response or the haptic response based on a determination that the defined symptoms have increased over time.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more sensors are a microphone to detect voice of the entity, a heart rate monitor to detect heart rate of the entity, a pulse monitor to detect pulse of the entity, an electromyography (EMG) sensor to detect muscle tension of the entity, an accelerometer to measure body movement of the entity, a thermometer to measure body temperature of the entity, a galvanic skin response (GSR) sensor to measure electrodermal activity of the entity, a pedometer to count steps of the entity, a sleep monitor to track sleep pattern of the entity, a global positioning system (GPS) to track geolocation of the entity, an altimeter to monitor altitude of the entity, a barometer to measure atmospheric pressure surrounding the entity, a light sensor to measure light intake by the entity, a respiratory rate monitor to measure breathing rate of the entity, a blood pressure monitor to measure blood pressure of the entity, an electrocardiographic (ECG) sensor to monitor electrical activity of a heart of the entity, or a pulse oximeter to monitor blood oxygen level of the entity.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the machine learning component utilizes voice recognition to detect a call for help from the entity.
8. The system of claim 1, further comprising a notification component that notifies a caregiver or emergency service if there is no detected improvement of the defined symptoms within a defined amount of time after the detection of the defined symptoms.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the notification component notifies the caregiver or the emergency service upon detection of a call for help from the entity.
10. A computer-implemented method, comprising: monitoring, by a system operatively coupled to a processor, a state of an entity; detecting, by the system, defined symptoms of the entity by analyzing the state of the entity; and transmitting, by the system, a signal that causes audio response or a haptic response to be provided to the entity, wherein transmission of the signal that causes the audio response or the haptic response is based on detection of the defined symptoms.
11. The computer-implemented method of claim 10, further comprising outputting, by the system, the audio response, wherein the audio response is a breathing exercise, music or heartbeat sound.
12. The computer-implemented method of claim 10, further comprising providing, by the system, the haptic response, wherein the haptic response is a shoulder massage or back massage.
13. The computer-implemented method of claim 10, further comprising changing, by the system, the audio response or the haptic response based on a determination that the defined symptoms have increased over time.
14. The computer-implemented method of claim 10, further comprising utilizing, by the system, voice recognition to detect a call for help from the entity.
15. The computer-implemented method of claim 10, further comprising notifying, by the system, a caregiver or emergency service if there is no detected improvement of the defined symptoms within a defined amount of time after the detection of the defined symptoms.
16. The computer-implemented method of claim 15, further comprising notifying, by the system, the caregiver or the emergency service upon detection of a call for help from the entity.
17. A computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by a processor to cause the processor to: monitor a state of an entity; detect defined symptoms of the entity by analyzing the state of the entity; and transmit a signal that causes audio response or a haptic response to be provided to the entity, wherein transmission of the signal that causes the audio response or the haptic response is based on detection of the defined symptoms.
18. The computer program product of claim 17, wherein the program instructions are further executable to cause the processor to: output the audio response, wherein the audio response is a breathing exercise, music or heartbeat sound.
19. The computer program product of claim 17, wherein the program instructions are further executable to cause the processor to: provide the haptic response, wherein the haptic response is a shoulder massage or back massage.
20. The computer program product of claim 17, wherein the program instructions are further executable to cause the processor to: notify a caregiver or emergency service if there is no detected improvement of the defined symptoms within a defined amount of time after the detection of the defined symptoms.
