<title>
SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR TEXT-ENABLED AUTOMATED AGENT ASSISTANCE WITHIN A CLOUD-BASED CONTACT CENTER
</title>

<abstract>
Methods to reduce agent effort and improve customer experience quality through artificial intelligence. The Agent Assist tool provides contact centers with an innovative tool designed to reduce agent effort, improve quality and reduce costs by minimizing search and data entry tasks The Agent Assist tool is natively built and fully unified within the agent interface while keeping all data internally protected from third-party sharing.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: receiving a text communication from a customer; performing inference processing on the text to determine a customer intent; automatically analyzing the text to determine a subject of the text communication and key terms associated with the subject; automatically parsing a knowledgebase using the key terms for at least one responsive answer associated with the subject; and providing the solution to an agent in a unified interface during the communication with the customer.
2. The method of 1, further comprising: querying a customer relationship management (CRM) platform/a customer service management (CSM) platform using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the CRM/CSM in the second field in the unified interface.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: querying a database of customer-agent transcripts using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the database of customer-agent transcripts in the second field in the unified interface.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the method is performed in real-time as the customer communication progresses with the agent.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising concurrently displaying to the agent the text in a first field of the unified interface and the solution in a second field of the unified interface.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising authenticating the customer, predicting a customer gender, predicting a customer age category, predicting a customer accent, and predict customer demographics.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising extracting features associated with the customer.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the features comprise pain, agony, empathy, sarcasm, tone, frustration, enthusiasm, interest and engagement.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising providing the solution as a text-based communication to the customer.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising highlighting the key terms in the unified interface.
11. A cloud-based software platform comprising: one or more computer processors; and one or more computer-readable mediums storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more computer processors, cause the cloud-based software platform to perform operations comprising: receiving a text communication from a customer; performing inference processing on the text to determine a customer intent; automatically analyzing the text to determine a subject of the text communication and key terms associated with the subject; automatically parsing a knowledgebase using the key terms for at least one responsive answer associated with the subject; and providing the solution to an agent in a unified interface during the communication with the customer.
12. The cloud-based software platform of 1, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising: querying a customer relationship management (CRM) platform/a customer service management (CSM) platform using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the CRM/CSM in the second field in the unified interface.
13. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising: querying a database of customer-agent transcripts using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the database of customer-agent transcripts in the second field in the unified interface.
14. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, wherein the operations are performed in real-time as the customer communication progresses with the agent.
15. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising concurrently displaying to the agent the text in a first field of the unified interface and the solution in a second field of the unified interface.
16. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising authenticating the customer, predicting a customer gender, predicting a customer age category, predicting a customer accent, and predict customer demographics.
17. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising extracting features associated with the customer.
18. The cloud-based software platform of claim 17, wherein the features comprise pain, agony, empathy, sarcasm, tone, frustration, enthusiasm, interest and engagement.
19. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising providing the solution as a text-based communication to the customer.
20. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising highlighting the key terms in the unified interface.
