Wearable device having sensor-dependent behavior modification
</title>

<abstract>
A wearable device having sensor-dependent behavior modification, according to one embodiment, includes a housing configured for positioning on a human body. A plurality of sensors are positioned in and/or on the housing for detecting a condition of the wearable device and/or an environment of the wearable device. A processing circuit in the housing is coupled to the sensors for receiving sensor data therefrom. A computer readable storage medium is coupled to the processing circuit, the computer readable storage medium having program instructions stored therein, which when executed by the processing circuit cause the processing circuit to change a state of the wearable device based on the sensor data.

<claims>
1. A wearable device having sensor-dependent behavior modification of the wearable device, comprising: a housing configured for positioning on a human body; a plurality of sensors in and/or on the housing for detecting a condition of the wearable device and/or an environment of the wearable device, wherein a first of the plurality of sensors is a thermal sensor; a processing circuit in the housing, the processing circuit being coupled to the sensors for receiving sensor data therefrom; and a computer readable storage medium coupled to the processing circuit, the computer readable storage medium having program instructions stored therein, which when executed by the processing circuit cause the processing circuit to: change a current state of the wearable device to a new state of the wearable device based on the sensor data; wherein changing the state of the wearable device includes increasing a rate of sensor data acquisition for enabling heart rate waveform sensing, wherein increasing a rate of sensor data acquisition includes increasing a sampling rate of at least some of the plurality of sensors and increasing a frequency of a cadence of at least some of the plurality of sensors.
2. The wearable device as recited in claim 1, wherein changing the state of the wearable device includes enabling a user sleep detection mode.
3. The wearable device as recited in claim 1, wherein changing the state of the wearable device includes adjusting internal algorithm parameters, wherein a first of the plurality of sensors is an electrochemical sensor.
4. The wearable device as recited in claim 1, wherein changing the state of the wearable device includes shifting to an alternate subset of runtime operating code, wherein the alternate subset of runtime operation code is configured to be executed for performing functions of the new state of the wearable device.
5. A method for sensor-dependent behavior modification of a wearable device having a housing configured for positioning on a human body of a user and a plurality of sensors in and/or on the housing for detecting a condition of the wearable device and/or an environment of the wearable device, the method comprising: receiving biometric sensor data about the human body of the user from the sensors; and changing a current state of the wearable device to a new state of the wearable device based on the received biometric sensor data.
6. The method as recited in claim 5, wherein changing the current state of the wearable device includes increasing a rate of sensor data acquisition, and the method comprising: applying a predefined filtering algorithm for determining whether the received biometric sensor data includes extraneous system noise resulting from the wearable device being incorrectly positioned on a body location of a user, wherein the body location of the user is pre-specified as a body location for collection of the sensor data; and in response to a determination that the received biometric sensor data includes extraneous system noise, removing portions of the received data that correspond to the extraneous system noise from the received data, wherein only remaining portions of the received data are considered for changing the current state of the wearable device to the new state of the wearable device.
7. The method as recited in claim 5, wherein changing the current state of the wearable device to the new state of the wearable device includes adjusting internal algorithm parameters.
8. The method as recited in claim 5, wherein changing the current state of the wearable device to the new state of the wearable device includes shifting to an alternate subset of runtime operating code.
9. The wearable device as recited in claim 3, wherein a second of the plurality of sensors is a thermal sensor.
10. The method as recited in claim 5, wherein changing the current state of the wearable device to the new state of the wearable device includes enabling a user sleep detection mode, wherein a first of the plurality of sensors is an electrochemical sensor, wherein a second of the plurality of sensors is a thermal sensor, wherein changing the current state of the wearable device to the new state of the wearable device includes increasing a rate of sensor data acquisition for enabling heart rate waveform sensing, wherein increasing a rate of sensor data acquisition includes increasing a sampling rate of at least some of the plurality of sensors and increasing a frequency of a cadence of at least some of the plurality of sensors, and the method comprising: applying a predefined filtering algorithm for determining whether the received biometric sensor data includes extraneous system noise resulting from the wearable device being incorrectly positioned on a body location of a user, wherein the body location of the user is pre-specified as a body location for collection of the sensor data; and in response to a determination that the received biometric sensor data includes extraneous system noise, removing portions of the received data that correspond to the extraneous system noise from the received data, wherein only remaining portions of the received data are considered for changing the current state of the wearable device to the new state of the wearable device.
11. A computer program product for sensor-dependent behavior modification of a wearable device, the computer program product comprising a nontransitory computer readable medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by a computer to cause the computer to: receive sensor data from sensors of a wearable device having a housing configured for positioning on a human body and a plurality of sensors in and/or on the housing for detecting a condition of the wearable device and/or an environment of the wearable device; and change a state of the wearable device based on the sensor data.
12. The computer program product of claim 11, wherein changing the state of the wearable device includes enabling a user sleep detection mode.
13. The computer program product of claim 11, wherein changing the state of the wearable device includes adjusting internal algorithm parameters.
14. The computer program product of claim 11, wherein changing the state of the wearable device includes shifting to an alternate subset of runtime operating code.
