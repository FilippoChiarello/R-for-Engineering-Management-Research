COMPUTER DEVICE FOR TRAINING A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
A computer device for training a deep neural network is provided. The computer device includes a receiving unit for receiving a two-dimensional input image frame, and a deep neural network for examining the two-dimensional input image frame in view of objects being included in the two-dimensional input image frame. The deep neural network includes a plurality of hidden layers and an output layer representing a decision layer. The computer device includes a training unit for training the deep neural network using transfer learning based on synthetic images for generating a model comprising trained parameters, and an output unit for outputting a result of the deep neural network based on the model.
