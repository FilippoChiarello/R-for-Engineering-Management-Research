<title>
Acoustic sensor and ventilation monitoring system
</title>

<abstract>
A method of monitoring respiration with an acoustic measurement device, the acoustic measurement device having a sound transducer, the sound transducer configured to measure sound associated with airflow through a mammalian trachea, the method includes correlating the measured sound into a measurement of tidal volume and generating at least one from the group consisting of an alert and an alarm if the measured tidal volume falls outside of a predetermined range.

<claims>
1. A method of monitoring respiration with an acoustic measurement device, the acoustic measurement device having a sound transducer, the sound transducer configured to measure sound associated with airflow through a mammalian trachea, the method comprising: correlating the measured sound into a measurement of tidal volume; and generating at least one from the group consisting of an alert and an alarm if the measured tidal volume falls outside of a predetermined range.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the measurement of sound associated with airflow through the trachea occurs at least periodically.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the acoustic measurement device includes a housing, and wherein the sound transducer is suspended within the housing.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the housing of the acoustic measurement device has a width between 0.5 cm and 2.5 cm.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the housing defines an opening, and wherein the sound transducer is disposed on an end of the housing opposite the opening.
6. The method of claim 3, wherein the housing is configured to releasably couple to skin of the mammalian trachea.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the housing includes a diaphragm configured to vibrate in response to sound.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the housing is configured to engage coupling component releasably adhered to the skin, and wherein the coupling component includes the diaphragm.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the housing includes a connector configured to engage the coupling component.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the acoustic measurement device further includes an accelerometer configured to measure a relative body position and a movement of the mammal, and wherein the method further includes modifying the respective predetermined range on the mammal's relative position and movement.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the acoustic measurement device further includes at least one from the group consisting of a device configured to measure a cardiac electrogram, temperature, and blood oxygenation.
12. The method of claim 1, further including calculating at least one from the group consisting of a rate of change and trend direction of the measured tidal volume, and wherein the at least one from the group consisting of the alert and the alarm is further generated if the calculated rate of change and trend direction of the tidal volume falls outside the predetermined range.
13. The method of claim 1, further including filtering out ambient noise from the measured sound.
14. An acoustic measurement device, comprising: a housing defining a chamber therein, the housing defining a width and a length of 2 cm or less, the housing defining an opening; a sound transducer disposed within the chamber opposite the opening; an adhesive surrounding the opening; and a wireless transmitter in communication with the sound transducer.
15. The device of claim 14, wherein the housing is surrounded by a sound insulation material except around the opening.
16. The device of claim 14, further including a diaphragm disposed within the opening and coextensive with a surface of the housing, the diaphragm being configured to resonate in response to sound.
17. The device of claim 16, wherein the diaphragm is coupled to the sound transducer.
18. The device of claim 14, further including a power source coupled to the housing, wherein the power source is configured to power the wireless transmitter.
19. The device of claim 14, wherein the housing includes a first connector configured to engage a second connector of a coupling component, the coupling component being configured to be adhered to the patient's skin, and wherein the coupling component includes the adhesive and a diaphragm, the adhesive being disposed about at least a portion of the second connector and the diaphragm.
20. An acoustic ventilation monitoring system, comprising: an acoustic measurement device, the acoustic measurement device including: a housing defining a chamber therein, the housing defining a width and a length of 2 cm or less, the housing defining an opening and being configured to releasably couple to a surface proximate a mammalian trachea; a sound transducer disposed within the chamber opposite the opening configured to measure sound energy emanating from the patient's trachea and lungs; a wireless transmitter in communication with the sound transducer; and a controller in communication with the acoustic measurement device, the controller being configured to: correlate the measured sound energy into a measurement of tidal volume and respiratory rate in real-time; and assign a first value of a likelihood of an adverse event based on the measured respiratory rate; assign a second value of a likelihood of the adverse event based on the measured tidal volume calculate a rate of change of the measured respiratory rate and tidal volume over time; assign a third value of a likelihood of the adverse event based on the calculated rate of change of the measured respiratory rate; assign a fourth value of a likelihood of the adverse event based on the calculated rate of change of the measured tidal volume; multiply the third value and the fourth value by a predetermined weighing factor; and generate an alert if a sum of the first value, the second value, the third value, and the fourth value, exceeds a predetermined risk score threshold.
