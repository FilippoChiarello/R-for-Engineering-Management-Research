DATA STRUCTURES FOR REFINED LINK TRAINING
</title>

<abstract>
A port (505) of a computing device (605) includes protocol circuitry to implement a particular interconnect protocol (615), where the protocol circuitry is to generate a set of ordered sets defined according to the particular interconnect protocol (615). The set of ordered sets is generated for a link (515) to couple a first device (605) to a second device (610) and the set of ordered sets comprises link information for the link (515). Translation layer circuitry (620) is provided to: generate, from the set of ordered sets, at least one data structure to comprise at least a portion of the link information, and cause the data structure to be sent from the first device (605) to the second device (610) on the link (515) in lieu of the set of ordered sets.

<claims>
1. 1. An apparatus comprising: protocol circuitry to implement a protocol stack of a particular interconnect protocol, wherein the protocol circuitry is to generate a set of ordered sets defined according to the particular interconnect protocol, the set of ordered sets is generated for a link to couple a first device to a second device, and the set of ordered sets comprises link information for the link; and translation layer circuitry to: generate, from the set of ordered sets, at least one data structure to comprise at least a portion of the link information; and cause the data structure to be sent from the first device to the second device on the link in lieu of the set of ordered sets.
2. 2. The apparatus of Claim 1, wherein the link comprises an asymmetrical link and the particular interconnect protocol assumes the link to comprise a symmetrical link.
3. 3. The apparatus of any one of Claims 1-2, wherein the set of ordered sets comprise a number of instances of a particular ordered set, each one of the number of instances of the particular ordered set is intended to be sent on a respective one of a number of lanes for the link, the link information in the data structure comprises link information for a particular one of the number of lanes, and two or more lanes of the link are to be used to send the data structure.
4. 4. The apparatus of Claim 3, wherein the link actually comprises fewer than the number of lanes.
5. 5. The apparatus of any one of Claims 3-4, wherein the data structure comprises a lane identifier to identify that the link information pertains to the particular lane.
6. 6. The apparatus of any one of Claims 3-5, wherein the at least one data structure comprises two or more data structures, a first one of the two or more data structures comprises link information for the particular lane, and a second one of the two or more data structures comprises link information for another one of the number of lanes.
7. 7. The apparatus of any one of Claims 1-6, wherein each ordered set in the set of ordered sets comprises a set of fields defined according to the particular interconnect, the set of fields comprise the link information, and the data structure comprises fields corresponding to at least a portion of the set of fields.
8. 8. The apparatus of Claim 7, wherein the fields of the data structure further comprises one or more particular fields to supplement the set of fields.
9. 9. The apparatus of any one of Claims 1-8, wherein the link comprises a plurality of lanes and the data structure comprises is to be sent on the plurality of lanes by striping bits of the data structure across the plurality of lanes.
10. 10. The apparatus of any one of Claims 1-9, wherein the interconnect protocol comprises a Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe)-based protocol.
11. 11. The apparatus of any one of Claims 1-10, wherein the set of ordered sets comprises one or more instances of a pattern, and the translation layer circuitry is to separate the pattern from the link information and transmit the pattern on the link in addition to the data structure.
12. 12. The apparatus of Claim 11, wherein the pattern comprises a high-speed link training sequence.
13. 13. The apparatus of Claim 12, wherein the pattern is defined to be used for at least one of bit lock or symbol lock during high speed link training.
14. 14. The apparatus of any one of Claims 1-13, wherein the set ordered sets comprises instances of a particular type of ordered set, generation of the data structure comprises: detecting the particular type of ordered set; identifying that a particular one of a plurality of types of data structures corresponds to the particular type of ordered set; and generating the data structure according to the particular type of data structure.
15. 1. 15. The apparatus of any one of Claims 1-14, wherein the link information comprises one or more of operational parameters for lanes of the link, link state transition information, and runtime status information for the link.
