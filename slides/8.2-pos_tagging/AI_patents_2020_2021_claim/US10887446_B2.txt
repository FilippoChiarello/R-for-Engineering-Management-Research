<title>
Detecting nuisance and restricted communications via a communication privilege control system
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques are described that facilitate generating a set of communication privilege rules that control real-time communication session associated with a client account. More specifically, a Communication Privilege Control (CPC) system is described that can generate a set of communication privilege rules for control of a communication session. The CPC system may detect a real-time communication session between a client device associated with a client account and a third-party device, and in doing so, determine whether the real-time communication session is restricted by the set of communication privilege rules. In doing so, the CPC system may transmit notification data to a trusted device associated with the client account. The notification data may include one or more selectable options to permit the trusted device to control the real-time communication session.
