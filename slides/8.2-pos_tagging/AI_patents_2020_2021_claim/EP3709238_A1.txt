</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for decontaminating raw yield maps by combining filters with spatial outlier detectors is provided. In an embodiment, the method comprises receiving over a computer network electronic digital data comprising first yield data representing crop yields har vested from an agricultural field; applying one or more filters to the first yield data to identify, from the first yield data, first outlier data; generating first filtered data from the first yield data by removing the first outlier data from the first yield data; identifying, in the first filtered data, second outlier data representing outlier values based on one or more outlier characteristics; generating second outlier data from the first filtered data by removing the second outlier data from the first filtered data; generating and causing displaying on a mobile computing device a graphical representation of the crop yields harvested from the agricultural field using only the second outlier data.
