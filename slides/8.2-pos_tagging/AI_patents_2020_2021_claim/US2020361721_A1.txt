SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PNEUMATIC TUBE SMART CARRIER TRACKING
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for tracking carriers and other critical path items are provided. The systems and methods comprise structure and functionality to allow for the real-time tracking of pneumatic tube smart carriers and other devices including the use of an IoT capable device, a computer, and an IoT access point. The present disclosure also provides monitoring and analytics capabilities to allow for complex information to be tracked. Such information includes, but is not limited to carrier velocity, air flow, and latch status of the carrier's door.

<claims>
1. A system for tracking a pneumatic tube carrier, the system comprising: a pneumatic tube carrier operable to house contents and be transmitted through a pneumatic transfer system; wherein the pneumatic tube carrier comprises an on-board wireless communication device; a central processing unit; a wireless access point, wherein the wireless access point is provided in wireless communication with the pneumatic tube carrier and the central processing unit, and wherein data from the pneumatic tube carrier is transmitted to the central processing unit via the wireless access point.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the wireless communication device is provided within an interior volume of the pneumatic tube carrier.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the wireless communication device is selectively insertable and removable from the pneumatic tube carrier.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the central processing unit comprises a computer with memory.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the wireless access point comprises at least one of a router, a gateway, a dual radio indoor access point, and a Wi-Fi network.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the pneumatic tube carrier comprises an access door to permit access to an interior volume of the pneumatic tube carrier and the access door is in communication with the central processing unit via the on-board wireless communication device.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the central processing unit comprises a GUI and the GUI is operable to provide information related to at least one of a physical location, speed, and status of the pneumatic tube carrier.
8. A pneumatic tube carrier operable to house contents and be transmitted through a pneumatic transfer system, the pneumatic tube carrier comprising: a housing at least partially defining an interior volume for receiving and transmitting carrier contents; an on-board wireless communication device with a dedicated power source; wherein the pneumatic tube carrier is provided in wireless communication with a central processing unit; and wherein the pneumatic tube carrier is provided in wireless communication with a wireless access point, wherein the wireless access point is provided in wireless communication with the on-board wireless communication device of the pneumatic tube carrier and the central processing unit, and wherein data from the pneumatic tube carrier is transmitted to the central processing unit via the wireless access point.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the wireless communication device is provided within an interior volume of the pneumatic tube carrier.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the wireless communication device is selectively insertable and removable from the pneumatic tube carrier.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the central processing unit comprises at least one of a personal computer, a smartphone and a tablet.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the wireless access point comprises at least one of a router, a gateway, a dual radio indoor access point, and a Wi-Fi network.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the pneumatic tube carrier comprises an access door to permit access to an interior volume of the pneumatic tube carrier and the access door is in communication with the on-board wireless communication device.
14. The system of claim 8, wherein the central processing unit comprises a GUI and the GUI is operable to provide information related to at least one of a physical location, speed, and status of the pneumatic tube carrier.
15. A system for tracking a pneumatic tube carrier, the system comprising: a pneumatic tube carrier operable to house contents and be transmitted through a pneumatic transfer system; wherein the pneumatic tube carrier comprises an on-board wireless communication device; a central processing unit; a wireless access point, wherein the wireless access point is provided in communication with the pneumatic tube carrier and the central processing unit, and wherein data from the pneumatic tube carrier is transmitted to the central processing unit via the wireless access point.
16. The system of claim 15, further comprising a wireless handheld device operable to scan the pneumatic tube carrier.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein the wireless handheld device comprises a smartphone or a tablet.
18. The system of claim 16, wherein the system is operable to generate a unique identifier code upon confirmation that the pneumatic tube carrier has been received by a user, and the unique identifier code is transmitted to the central processing unit.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein the unique identifier code comprises information specific to the user.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein the unique identifier code further comprises information related to at least one of an opening and a closing of a door provided on the pneumatic carrier.
