METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR PREDICTING OR DIAGNOSING CANCER
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides methods, systems, compositions, and kits for evaluating cancer risk. The methods and systems comprise producing an Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) profile derived from a sample collected from a human subject in need thereof, and executing a trained machine learning classifier to predict the probability that the human subject has cancer based on the OTU profile. Also provided are methods for diagnosing and treating a human subject at risk of having cancer, among other things.

<claims>
1. A computer-aided method for classifying a human subject in need thereof as having colorectal cancer (CRC) or being normal (NM), comprising the steps of: (a) obtaining a fecal sample taken from the human subject; (b) producing an Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) profile of the sample in step (a), (c) providing the OTU profile to a trained machine learning classifier; (d) executing the trained machine learning classifier to predict the probability that the human subject has colorectal cancer or is normal.
2. A computer-aided method for classifying a human subject in need thereof as having colorectal cancer (CRC), colorectal adenomas (AD), or being normal (NM), comprising the steps of: (a) obtaining a fecal sample taken from the human subject; (b) producing an Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) profile of the sample in step (a), (c) providing the OTU profile to a trained machine learning classifier; (d) executing the trained machine learning classifier to predict the probability that the human subject has colorectal cancer, has colorectal adenomas, or is normal.
3. A computer-aided method for classifying a human subject in need thereof as having colorectal cancer (CRC), polyps (PL), non-advanced adenomas (NA), advanced adenomas (AA), or being normal, comprising the steps of: (a) obtaining a fecal sample taken from the human subject; (b) producing an Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) profile of the sample in step (a), (c) providing the OTU profile to a trained machine learning classifier; (d) executing the trained machine learning classifier to predict the probability that the human subject has colorectal cancer, has polyps, has non-advanced adenomas, has advanced adenomas, or is normal.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the OTU profile is produced by (1) amplifying a 16S rRNA hyper variable region of microbial nucleic acid sequences present in the sample, (2) sequencing the amplified sequences; (3) producing a list of unique microbial sequences present in the fecal sample based on the sequencing result of step (2) to form the OTU profile, wherein the list comprises abundance information of each unique microbial sequence.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the 16S rRNA hyper variable region is the V3-V4 hyper variable region.
6. The method of claim 3, wherein the OTUs profile of step b) comprises expression profile of one or more microbial nucleic acid sequences having at least 95% identity to a consensus sequence in SEQ ID NOs. 1-345.
7. The method of claim 3, wherein the machine learning classifier is selected from the group consisting of decision tree classifier, K-nearest neighbor classifier (KNN), logistic regression classifier, nearest neighbor classifier, neural network classifier, Gaussian mixture model (GMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, nearest centroid classifier, linear regression classifier and random forest classifier.
8. 8-9. (canceled)
10. The method of claim 3, wherein the machine learning classifier has been trained using a set of reference data of a reference human subject population comprising colorectal cancer, polyps, non-advanced adenomas, advanced adenomas, and normal human subjects.
11. 11-12. (canceled)
13. The method of claim 10, wherein the reference data is produced by a process comprising the following steps: (1) obtaining a collection of human subject fecal samples as training samples, wherein the fecal samples are collected from colorectal cancer, polyps, non-advanced adenomas, advanced adenomas, and normal human subjects, (2) for each fecal sample in the collection, (i) amplifying 16S rRNA hyper variable region of bacterial nucleic acid sequences, (ii) sequencing the amplified sequences; and (iii) producing a list of unique microbial sequences present in the sample, wherein the list comprises abundance information of each unique microbial sequence; (3) grouping the lists of unique microbial sequences obtained in step (2) to form a reference OTU matrix as the reference data, wherein the reference matrix comprises abundance information of each unique microbial sequence for each fecal sample.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the reference OTU matrix is normalized such that the sum of sequence abundance for each sample is the same.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein the reference OTU matrix is simplified by reducing the number of OTUs through feature selection.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the feature selection is to remove low abundant OTUs across training samples.
17. The method of claim 3, wherein the machine learning classifier is a random forest classifier.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein hyperparameters of the random forest are tuned using cross validation method.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the hyperparameters to be tuned comprise the number of trees, number of maximum features used for each split of tree, and minimum samples per leaf.

31. The method of claim 10, wherein nucleic acid sequences in the samples collected from the reference human subject population are processed together with the sample collected from the human subject in need thereof for amplification and sequencing, to produce a set of reference data for training the classifier.
