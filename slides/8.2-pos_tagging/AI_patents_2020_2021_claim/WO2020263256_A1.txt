ASSEMBLY FOR PLACEMENT OF SENSORS WITHIN TIRE
</title>

<abstract>
An assembly (10) for positioning sensors within a tire is provided that has first and second bead sensors (14,16), and first and second sidewall/shoulder sensors (18, 20). A first actuator (30) moves the sensors in a radial direction of the tire, and a second actuator (32) moves the first and second bead sensors in the axial direction of the tire. A third actuator (34) is present and moves the first and second bead sensors in the axial direction relative to the first and second sidewall/shoulder sensors. A fourth actuator (36) moves the first and second bead sensors in the axial direction relative to one another, and a fifth actuator (38) moves the first and second sidewall/shoulder sensors in the axial direction relative to one another.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. An assembly for positioning sensors within a tire, comprising:
a first bead sensor;
a second bead sensor;
a first sidewall/shoulder sensor;
a second sidewall/shoulder sensor;
a first actuator that moves the first bead sensor, the second bead sensor, the first sidewall/shoulder sensor, and the second sidewall/shoulder sensor in a radial direction of the tire;
a second actuator that moves the first bead sensor and the second bead sensor in an axial direction of the tire such that the first bead sensor and the second bead sensor move in the axial direction relative to the first sidewall/shoulder sensor and the second sidewall/shoulder sensor;
a third actuator that moves the first bead sensor and the second bead sensor in the radial direction such that the first bead sensor and the second bead sensor move in the radial direction relative to the first sidewall/shoulder sensor and the second sidewall/shoulder sensor;
a fourth actuator that moves the first bead sensor and the second bead sensor in the axial direction relative to one another; and
a fifth actuator that moves the first sidewall/shoulder sensor and the second sidewall/shoulder sensor in the axial direction relative to one another.
2. The assembly as set forth in claim 1, wherein the first actuator moves the second actuator, the third actuator, the fourth actuator, and the fifth actuator in the radial direction.
3. The assembly as set forth in claims 1 or 2, wherein the first actuator is a pneumatic cylinder.
4. The assembly as set forth in any one of claims 1-3, wherein the second actuator moves the fourth actuator in the axial direction.
5. The assembly as set forth in any one of claims 1-4, wherein the second actuator is a pneumatic slide.
6. The assembly as set forth in any one of claims 1-5, wherein the third actuator moves the second actuator and the fourth actuator in the radial direction.
7. The assembly as set forth in any one of claims 1-6, wherein the third actuator is a servomotor.
8. The assembly as set forth in any one of claims 1-7, wherein the fourth actuator simultaneously moves the first bead sensor and the second bead sensor in the axial direction such that the first bead sensor and the second bead sensor are moved relative to one another in the axial direction.
9. The assembly as set forth in any one of claims 1-8, wherein the fourth actuator is a pneumatic cylinder.
10. The assembly as set forth in any one of claims 1-9, wherein the fifth actuator simultaneously moves the first sidewall/shoulder sensor and the second sidewall/shoulder sensor in the axial direction such that the first sidewall/shoulder sensor and the second sidewall/shoulder sensor are moved relative to one another in the axial direction.
11. The assembly as set forth in any one of claims 1-10, further comprising:
a frame that carries the first bead sensor, the second bead sensor, the first sidewall/shoulder sensor, the second sidewall/shoulder sensor, the first actuator, the second actuator, the third actuator, the fourth actuator, and the fifth actuator;
a post onto which the frame is pivotally mounted;
a frame actuator that is a pneumatic cylinder that urges the frame to pivot about the post such that the first bead sensor, the second bead sensor, the first sidewall/shoulder sensor, the second sidewall/shoulder sensor, the first actuator, the second actuator, the third actuator, the fourth actuator, and the fifth actuator pivot about the post.
12. The assembly as set forth in any one claims Ti l, further comprising a wheel post that has a pair of wheels that are configured for engaging an inner surface of the tire during measurements of the tire by the first bead sensor, the second bead sensor, the first sidewall/shoulder sensor, and the second sidewall/shoulder sensor;
wherein the wheel post is moved in the radial direction by the first actuator, and wherein the wheel post is not moved by the second actuator, the third actuator, the fourth actuator, or the fifth actuator.
13. The assembly as set forth in any one of claims 1-12, wherein the first bead sensor, the second bead sensor, the first sidewall/shoulder sensor, and the second sidewall/shoulder sensor are configured for engaging an inner surface of the tire and for detecting cord damage inside of the tire.
