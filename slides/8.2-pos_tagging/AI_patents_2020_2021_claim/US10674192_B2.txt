</title>

<abstract>
Methods, computer program products, and systems are presented. The method computer program products, and systems can include, for instance: obtaining a first media stream, the first media stream being played on a first playback device and having first timestamps indicating when respective different time ordered sections of data defining the first media stream have been played by the first playback device; obtaining a second media stream, the second media stream being played on a second playback device and having second timestamps indicating when respective different time ordered sections of data defining the second media stream have been played by the second playback device, wherein the first media stream and second media stream are common media streams being simultaneously played by the first playback device and the second playback device, respectively, at desynchronized times.
