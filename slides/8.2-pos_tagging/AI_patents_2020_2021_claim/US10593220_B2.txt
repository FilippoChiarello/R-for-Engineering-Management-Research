Systems and methods for bias-sensitive crowd-sourced analytics
</title>

<abstract>
A bias-sensitive crowd-sourced analytic system is disclosed that provides a collaborative, moderated, computer-mediated environment that includes integrated evaluation of analytical skill and cognitive de-biasing training; a simple, binary blue-team/red-team format that incorporates teaming and dedicated devil's advocacy; and accountability through quantitative scoring of reasoning, responses and associated confidence levels.

<claims>
1. A method of controlling access provisions in a multi-user, collaborative computer environment, the method comprising: initiating a workflow process associated with a structured analytic technique by one or more servers; establishing, by the one or more servers in response to initiating the workflow process, a collaborative data space that is simultaneously accessible by users over a communication network; dynamically grouping at least a subset of the users into groups, the groups including at least a first group of the users and a second group of the users; rendering, selectively, a sequence of timed windows on user devices in communication with the one or more servers through which input from the first group of the users and the second group of the users is received and according to a continuous clock functionality being executed by the one or more servers in response to execution of the workflow process; controlling access provisions to content in the collaborative data space in a first access phase to grant the first group of the users access to the content and to deny the second group of the users access to the content; receiving input in the collaborative data space from the first group of users via the timed windows to collaboratively modify the content of the data space in the first access phase; preventing access to the content of the collaborative data space from the second group of the users in the first access phase; and dynamically modifying the access provisions to the content in the collaborative data space in a second access phase to deny the first group of the users access to the content and to grant the second group of the users access to the content in response to a configurable amount of time that has elapsed since the first group of users was provided access to the content of the collaborative data space or in response to an action of at least one of the users in the first group and after collaborative modification to the content of the collaborate data space is committed to a database, wherein rendering the sequence of timed windows on the user devices includes automatically relocating text information between the timed windows upon expiration of specified time intervals, and wherein the timed windows are rendered on the user devices of the first group of the users or the second group of the users based on the continuous clock function to grant or deny access to the content in the collaborative data space.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein rendering the sequence of time windows includes: rendering a first window containing textual information from the collaborative data space, the first window being rendered on the user devices associated with the first group of the users, the textual information guiding the users of the first group through a review of evidence; rendering a second window on the user devices associated with the first group of users, the second window revealing the status of evidence being analyzed and probabilistic estimates of evidence being analyzed; and rendering a third window on the user devices of the first group of users that provides a computer-mediated synchronous communication interface through which the users of the first group debate the evidence in a contemporaneous forum, and within a first timed interval, provide probability estimates on hypothesized outcomes, the first timed interval being implemented by the continuous clock functionality.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: relocating the textual information of the first, second and third windows, by the one or more servers, to a fourth window automatically upon expiration of the first timed interval, the fourth window being rendered on the user devices associated with the second group of the users, one or more of the users in the second group being one or more end users, the first and second groups being mutually exclusive from each other, the textual information is relocated to the fourth window for review by the one or more end users in the second group independent of the first group of the users, the fourth window being configured to receive a separate estimate.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising: relocating the text information to a fifth window when a new group of one or more users are permitted to review the textual information, the new group of one or more users being permitted to review the textual information upon expiration of a second timed interval, the new group of one or more users generating a group estimate.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising: returning the relocated textual information, by the processor, from the fifth window back to the fourth window to prompt the one or more end users for a final estimate.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising: in response to a specified degree of disparity in the final estimate and the group estimate, automatically routing the one or more end users to the beginning of the workflow process.
7. The method of claim 3, wherein the textual information analyzed by the users in the first, second and third windows is presented as evidence to the one or more end users in the fourth window allowing the one or more end users to take into account the evidence analyzed by the one or more users in the first, second and third windows.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the workflow process does not require the one or more end users to take into account the evidence analyzed by the one or more users in the first, second and third windows.
9. The method of claim 2, wherein the textual information in the first window guides the one or more users within the graphical user interface through a verification review of evidence.
10. The method of claim 2, further comprising: scoring the probability estimates on the hypothesized outcomes on the basis of accuracy after answers have been revealed.
11. A system controlling access provisions in a multi-user, collaborative computer environment, the system comprising: one or more non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions executable by one or more servers and a collaborative data space; one or more servers, the one or more servers execute the instructions to: initiate a workflow process associated with a structured analytic technique; establish, in response to initiating the workflow process, the collaborative data space in the one or more computer-readable media, the collaborative data space being simultaneously accessible by users over a communication network; dynamically group at least a subset of the users into groups, the groups including at least a first group of the users and a second group of the users; render, selectively, a sequence of timed windows on user devices in communication with the one or more servers through which input from the first group of the users and the second group of the users is received and according to a continuous clock functionality being executed by the one or more servers in response to execution of the workflow process; control access provisions to content in the collaborative data space in a first access phase to grant the first group of the users access to the content and to deny the second group of the users access to the content; receive input in the collaborative data space from the first group of users via the timed windows to collaboratively modify the content of the data space in the first access phase; prevent access to the content of the collaborative data space from the second group of the users in the first access phase; and dynamically modify the access provisions to the content in the collaborative data space in a second access phase to deny the first group of the users access to the content and to grant the second group of the users access to the content in response to a configurable amount of time that has elapsed since the first group of users was provided access to the content of the collaborative data space or in response to an action of at least one of the users in the first group and after collaborative modification to the content of the collaborate data space is committed to a database, wherein the sequence of timed windows is rendered on the user devices to include automatically relocating text information between the timed windows upon expiration of specified time intervals, and wherein the timed windows are rendered on the user devices of the first group of the users or the second group of the users based on the continuous clock function to grant or deny access to the content in the collaborative data space.
