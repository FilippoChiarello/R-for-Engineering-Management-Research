<title>
Storage apparatus, storage system, and performance evaluation method using cyclic information cycled within a group of storage apparatuses
</title>

<abstract>
A storage apparatus includes a controller unit and output unit. The controller receives cyclic information that is cycled within a specific group of storage apparatuses with properties close to a relevant storage apparatus. The cyclic information includes performance information of each storage apparatus in the specific group and evaluation information indicative of an evaluation result of the performance information of each storage apparatus. The controller acquires the performance information including the evaluation results, combines it with the cyclic information, and transmits the cyclic information to a storage apparatus which is a next cycling destination. A similarity level may be calculated based on configuration information and a predetermined weight. A specific group may be formed by checking whether storage apparatuses are capable of communicating with each other, so a cyclic path can be formed. The output unit may transmit performance information as information to be displayed on a user terminal.
