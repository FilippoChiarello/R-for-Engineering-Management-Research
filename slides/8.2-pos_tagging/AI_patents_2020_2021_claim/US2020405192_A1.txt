<title>
EXIT MONITORING SYSTEM FOR PATIENT SUPPORT APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
An exit prediction system receives movement data, divides the movement data into segments of time, extracts features from each segment of time, and determines a pattern of movement from the extracted features. A patient exit from a patient support apparatus is predicted based on the determined pattern of movement.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An exit prediction system, comprising: at least one processor; and a memory storing instructions which, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the system to: receive movement data; divide the movement data into segments of time; extract features from each segment of time; determine a pattern of movement from the extracted features; and predict a patient exit from a patient support apparatus based on the determined pattern of movement.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the memory stores further instructions which, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the system to: generate low, moderate, or high alerts based on the predicted patient exit.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the alerts are customizable based on factors related to patient fall and injury likelihood when exiting the patient support apparatus unattended.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the pattern of movement is evaluated by a bed exit prediction model built by machine learning, deep learning, or artificial intelligence.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the bed exit prediction model is built using motion profiles that are pre-categorized as non-exit motions or exit motions.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the bed exit prediction model is calibrated based on multiple speed classifiers for various patient speeds.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the extracted features from each segment of time include a percentage change in load detected by load cells in the patient support apparatus.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the memory stores further instructions which, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the system to: assign output classes to each segment of time, each output class indicating a decision corresponding to an exit motion type or a non-exit motion type.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the memory stores further instructions which, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the system to: classify the pattern of movement as a non-exit pattern of movement or an exit pattern of movement based on the output classes over time.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is part of a centralized caregiver call system that generates alerts based on the predicted patient exit.
11. A method of predicting patient exit from a patient support apparatus, the method comprising: receiving motion profiles; pre-categorizing the motion profiles as non-exit motion or exit motion; extracting features from the pre-categorized motion profiles; generating a bed exit prediction model using the extracted features; and predicting patient exit from the patient support apparatus using the model.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising: generating low, moderate, or high alerts based on the predicted patient exit.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising: customizing the alerts based on additional factors related to patient fall and injury likelihood when the patent exits the patient support apparatus unattended.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein the bed exit prediction model identifies patterns from the extracted features using machine learning, deep learning, or artificial intelligence.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the patterns are identified by dividing the pre-categorized motion profiles into segments of time, and analyzing a row of features for each segment of time.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein predicting the patient exit from the patient support apparatus includes assigning output classes to segments of time within a motion profile detected from the patient support apparatus, each output class indicating a decision corresponding to an exit motion type or a non-exit motion type.
17. A non-transitory computer readable storage media, including computer readable instructions which when read and executed by a computing device, cause the computing device to: receive motion profiles; pre-categorize the motion profiles as non-exit motion or exit motion; extract features from the pre-categorized motion profiles; generate a bed exit prediction model using the extracted features; and predict patient exit from the patient support apparatus using the model.
18. The non-transitory computer readable storage media of 17, further comprising computer readable instructions which when read and executed by the computing device, cause the computing device to: generating low, moderate, or high alerts based on the predicted patient exit.
19. The non-transitory computer readable storage media of 18, further comprising computer readable instructions which when read and executed by the computing device, cause the computing device to: customize the alerts based on additional factors related to patient fall and injury likelihood when the patent exits the patient support apparatus unattended.
20. The non-transitory computer readable storage media of 17, wherein predict the patient exit from the patient support apparatus includes assigning output classes to segments of time within a motion profile detected from the patient support apparatus, each output class indicating a decision corresponding to an exit motion type or a non-exit motion type.
