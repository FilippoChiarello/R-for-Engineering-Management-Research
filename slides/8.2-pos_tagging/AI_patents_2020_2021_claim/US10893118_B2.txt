<title>
Content delivery network with deep caching infrastructure
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments herein include methods and systems for use in delivering resources to a client device over a local network. An exemplary system comprises a plurality of caching devices operable to cache resources on behalf of a plurality of content providers, and a local caching device communicatively situated between an access network and the client device, wherein the access network is communicably situated between the plurality of caching devices and the local caching device. The local caching device is operable to retrieve a requested resource from at least one of the plurality of caching devices, deliver the requested resource to the client device over the local network, and store the requested resource for future requests by other client devices.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving a request for a resource originating from a wireless client device connected to a first network, wherein the request is received prior to the request exiting the first network; determining whether the requested resource is serviceable by a first caching device of a second network; initiating delivery of the requested resource to the wireless client device from a second caching device of the first network when the requested resource is not serviceable by the first caching device; and initiating delivery of the requested resource to the wireless client device from the first caching device of the second network when the requested resource is serviceable by the first caching device, wherein the requested resource is provided to the wireless client device via the second network by bypassing at least a portion of the first network.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first network includes a portion of at least one of a cellular and/or mobile network.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: bypassing at least a portion of the at least one of the cellular and/or mobile network when the requested resource is provided to the wireless client device via the second network.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein a wireless hotspot includes the first caching device.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving the request for the resource at both the second caching device of the first network and a transceiver node of the second network, wherein the bypassed portion of the first network couples the transceiver node to a content delivery network.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising: routing the request for the resource using an anycast routing scheme.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: prefetching content, by the first caching device, based on a popularity of the content.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: retrieving, by the first caching device, the requested resource from one or more content delivery network caching devices.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein first network and second network are different network types.
10. A system comprising: a server comprising at least one processor that is operatively connected to memory, wherein the server is situated within a wireless network and operable to: receive a request for a resource originating from a wireless client device connected to the wireless network, wherein the request is received prior to the request exiting the wireless network, receive a determination as to whether the requested resource is serviceable by a first caching device of the wireless network, and initiate delivery of a portion of the requested resource to the wireless client device when the requested resource is serviceable by the first caching device; and a transceiver node coupled to a content delivery network via a cellular network, wherein the transceiver node is operable to receive a second request for the resource originating from the wireless client device, wherein the delivery of the portion of the requested resource to the wireless client device by the first caching device bypasses the cellular network.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the server is situated in a wireless network operating as a wireless hotspot.
12. The system of claim 10, wherein both the server and the transceiver node receive the request for the same resource.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the request for the resource is routed using an anycast routing scheme.
14. The system of claim 10, further comprising: prefetching content, by the server, based on a popularity of the content.
15. The system of claim 10, further comprising: retrieving, by the server, the requested resource from one or more content delivery network caching devices.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the server and the transceiver node are communicatively coupled to the same content delivery network.
17. A method comprising: receiving a first request for a resource originating from a wireless client device connected to a first network, wherein the first request is received prior to the first request exiting the first network; receiving a second request for the resource originating from the wireless client device connected to the first network at a transceiver node of a second network; determining whether the requested resource is serviceable by a caching device of the first network; initiating delivery of the requested resource to the wireless client device from a caching device communicatively coupled to the transceiver node of the second network when the requested resource is not serviceable by the caching device of the first network; and initiating delivery of the requested resource to the wireless client device from the caching device of the first network when the requested resource is serviceable by the caching device of the first network, wherein the requested resource is provided to the wireless client device via the first network by bypassing at least a portion of the second network coupling the transceiver node to the caching device of the second network.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein a wireless hotspot includes the caching device of the first network.
19. The method of claim 17, further comprising: prefetching content, by the caching device of the first network, based on a popularity of the content.
20. The method of claim 17, further comprising: retrieving, by the caching device of the first network, the requested resource from one or more content delivery network caching devices.
