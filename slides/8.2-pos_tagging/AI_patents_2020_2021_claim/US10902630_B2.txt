Passive sense and avoid system
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention provides a method suitable for use in a sense and avoid system of a vehicle having a hyperspectral imaging system, the method comprising: estimating the range to an object from the vehicle, wherein estimating the range comprises: measuring the emission spectrum of the object using the hyperspectral imaging system; identifying at least one trough and/or discontinuity in the emission spectrum by subtracting the measured emission spectrum from a perfect blackbody emission spectrum; and searching a storage means storing spectral radiances and/or wavelengths of troughs and/or discontinuities, each with an associated known atmospheric path length, for the corresponding spectral radiance and/or wavelength of the identified at least one trough and/or discontinuity in order to estimate the atmospheric path length, and consequently the range, between the object and the vehicle. The present invention also provides a sense and avoid system for performing the same method.
