<abstract>
A state change detection unit obtains the data generation probability on the basis of the values of observation data and the value of a parameter of a prior distribution, obtains, on the basis of the data generation probability, a run length probability distribution of the time-series observation data acquired up to the current time point as a condition, and detects a change in the state of a facility on the basis of the run length probability distribution. Furthermore, an update unit updates the value of the parameter of the prior distribution using the values of the observation data, to generate the prior distribution to be used for calculating the data generation probability at a next time point.
