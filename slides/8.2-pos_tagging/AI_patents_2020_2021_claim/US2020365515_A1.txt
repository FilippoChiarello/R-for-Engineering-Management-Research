ELECTRONIC PACKAGE WITH ROTATED SEMICONDUCTOR DIE
</title>

<abstract>
An electronic package configured to operate at Gigabit-per-second (Gbps) data rates is disclosed. The electronic package includes a package substrate of a rectangular shape. A chip package having a first high-speed interface circuit die is mounted on a top surface of the package substrate. The chip package is rotated relative to the package substrate above a vertical axis that is orthogonal to the top surface through about 45 degrees. The first high-speed interface circuit die includes a first Serializer/Deserializer (SerDes) circuit block.
