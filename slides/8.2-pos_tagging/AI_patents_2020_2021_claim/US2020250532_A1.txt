<abstract>
In some examples, a set of multiple input values are encoded on respective optical signals carried by optical waveguides. For each of at least two subsets of one or more optical signals, a corresponding set of one or more copying modules splits the subset of one or more optical signals into two or more copies of the optical signals. For each of at least two copies of a first subset of one or more optical signals, a corresponding multiplication module multiplies the one or more optical signals of the first subset by one or more matrix element values using optical amplitude modulation. For results of two or more of the multiplication modules, a summation module produces an electrical signal that represents a sum of the results of the two or more of the multiplication modules.
