<title>
Methods and system for iteratively aligning data sources
</title>

<abstract>
According to some aspects, a method for aligning a first data source and a second data source during a plurality of iterations comprising a current iteration and a previous iteration is provided. The method comprises generating at least one property alignment hypothesis between at least one first property of the first data source and at least one second property of the second data source; generating a plurality of instance alignment hypotheses between a respective first plurality of instances of the first data source and a respective second plurality of instances of the second data source; and verifying at least one property alignment hypothesis and/or at least one of the plurality of instance alignment hypotheses. Generating the at least one property alignment hypothesis and/or generating the plurality of instance alignment hypotheses is based, at least in part, on at least one property alignment hypothesis and/or at least one instance alignment hypothesis verified during the previous iteration.
