MULTIPORT MEMORY WITH ANALOG PORT
</title>

<abstract>
A multiport memory in which one of the ports is analog rather than digital is described. In one embodiment, the analog port functions as a read-only port and the digital port functions as a write only port. This allows the data in the core memory to be applied to an analog signal, while retaining a digital port having access to the core memory for rapid storage of data. One potential use of such a multiport memory is as a bridge between a digital computer and an analog computer; for example, this allows a digitally programmed two-port memory to derive a sum-of-products signal from a plurality of analog input signals, and a plurality of such multiport memories to be used in an analog neural network such as a programmable neural net implementing analog artificial intelligence (AI).

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A multiport memory, comprising:
a memory core containing memory cells arranged in a matrix having a plurality of lines, each line having a separate address;
a digital port configured to:
receive a first plurality of bits representing an address of one of the plurality of lines of memory cells; and
receive a second plurality of bits representing values that are to be stored in the one of the plurality of lines of memory cells at the address represented by the first plurality of bits; and an analog port configured to:
receive a plurality of analog input quantities, each input quantity corresponding to one of the plurality of lines of memory cells; and
generate a plurality of analog output quantities, the plurality of analog output quantities being a sum of products of each of the analog input quantities multiplied by the value stored on the one of the plurality of lines corresponding to each of the analog input quantities.
2. The multiport memory of claim 1, wherein the memory cells comprise programmable impedance elements.
3. The multiport memory of claim 2, wherein values of the programmable impedance elements are the values represented by the second plurality of bits.
4. The multiport memory of claim 2 wherein each of the programmable impedance elements comprises a plurality of field effect transistors biased into their resistive region and connected in a series and/or parallel
combination.
5. The multiport memory of claim 4 wherein the series and/or parallel combination of the field effect transistors is determined by the values represented by the second plurality of bits.
6. The multiport memory of claim 4 wherein each plurality of field effect transistors is connected in the series and/or parallel combination by a plurality of switches.
7. The multiport memory of claim 6 wherein each of the plurality of switches comprises a field effect transistor.
8. The multiport memory of claim 6 wherein each of the plurality of switches is in either an open position or a closed position based upon a bit in the values represented by the second plurality of bits.
9. The multiport memory of claim 8 wherein the bit upon which the open position or closed position is based is stored in a random access memory cell.
10. The multiport memory of claim 9 wherein each random access memory cell comprises a cell of six field effect transistors.
11. A neural network comprising first and second multiport memories, each multiport memory comprising:
a memory core containing memory cells arranged in a matrix having a plurality of lines, each line having a separate address;
a digital port configured to:
receive a first plurality of bits representing an address of one of the plurality of lines of memory cells; and
receive a second plurality of bits representing values that are to be stored in the one of the plurality of lines of memory cells at the address represented by the first plurality of bits; and an analog port configured to:
receive a plurality of analog input quantities, each input quantity corresponding to one of the plurality of lines of memory cells;
generate a plurality of analog output quantities, the plurality of analog output quantities being a sum of products of each of the analog input quantities multiplied by the value stored on the one of the plurality of lines corresponding to each of the analog input quantities; and
wherein the plurality of analog output quantities generated by the first multiport memory are the analog input quantities received by the second multiport memory.
