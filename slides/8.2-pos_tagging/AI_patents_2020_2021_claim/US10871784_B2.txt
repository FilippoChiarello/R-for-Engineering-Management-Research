<title>
Method and system for providing remote robotic control
</title>

<abstract>
A virtualized environment corresponding to a physical environment currently surrounding a robot is displayed. The virtualized environment is updated in accordance with streaming environment data received from sensors collocated with the robot. A first user input inserting a first virtual object at a first location in the virtualized environment is detected. The virtualized environment is modified in accordance with the insertion of the first virtual object at the first location. The first virtual object at the first location causes the robot to execute a first navigation path in the physical environment. A second user input is detected that moves the first virtual object along a movement path to a second location in the virtualized environment. The movement path is constrained by simulated surfaces in the virtualized environment, and the first virtual object at the second location causes the robot to execute a modified navigation path in the physical environment.
