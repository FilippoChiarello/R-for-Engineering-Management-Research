MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A machine learning system includes a learning section and an operating section including a memory. The operating section holds a required accuracy, and an internal state and a weight value of a learner in the memory and executes calculation processing by using data input to the machine learning system and the weight value held in the memory to update the internal state. An accuracy of the internal state is calculated from a result of the calculation processing and an evaluation value is calculated using the data input to the machine learning system, the weight value, and the updated internal state held in the memory when the calculated accuracy is higher than the required accuracy. The evaluation value is transmitted to the learning section, which updates the weight value by using the evaluation value and notifies the number of times of updating the weight value to the operating section.
