<title>
Intelligent system for multi-function electronic caregiving to facilitate advanced health diagnosis, health monitoring, fall and injury prediction, health maintenance and support, and emergency response
</title>

<abstract>
A system for monitoring and detecting the gait and other health related parameters of a user. One such parameter is monitoring of medication compliance and treatment session attendance done by a medication and liquid dispensing apparatus, which combines mechanical dispensing of medication. These parameters are provided in standard of care summaries to care providers, and are continually reported by the Optimum Recognition Blueprint as Standard of Care Summaries to care providers, as well as communicated to the end-user by the Virtual Caregiver Interface.

<claims>
1. A method for automated fall detection and reporting via a virtual system, the virtual system comprising at least one processor configured to execute the method comprising: receiving, at a processor in the virtual system, from a depth camera configured to be pointed at a human, a first data set of virtual movement markers comprising a cluster of data points in a shape of a body of the human, the first data set of virtual movement markers comprising a first movement marker estimated to a head location of the human, a second movement marker estimated to a spine location of the human, and a third movement marker estimated to a joint location of the human; receiving, at the processor in the virtual system, from the depth camera a second data set indicating volume in an area of a location of the human: detecting, at the processor in the virtual system, from an accelerometer, a rapid acceleration of at least two of the movement markers comprising the first data set of virtual movement markers, followed by a rapid deceleration of at least two of the movement markers comprising the first data set of virtual movement markers, wherein at least one of the rapid acceleration and the rapid deceleration includes a rapid change in direction of the location of at least one of the movement markers comprising the first data set of virtual movement markers; detecting, at the processor in the virtual system, an irregular pattern of activity for the human from changes in the first data set of virtual movement markers and the second data set; and sending, at the processor in the virtual system, an alert to a reporting device indicating that the human has fallen based on the detected irregular pattern of activity.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising processing the first data set and the second data set from the depth camera against an optimum recognition blueprint.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the alert to the reporting device comprises a communication from the virtual system to a monitoring central station with necessary information to dispatch local emergency services to the location of the human.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the alert to the reporting device comprises a communication from the virtual system to a user computing device warning that the human has fallen.
