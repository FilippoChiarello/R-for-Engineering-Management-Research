Machine learning system
</title>

<abstract>
A machine learning system using a neural network to output an output value corresponding to values of operating parameters of the machine. When the value of an operating parameter of a machine is outside a preset range, the number of nodes of the hidden layer one layer before the output layer of the neural network is increased and training data obtained by actual measurement for a newly acquired value of an operating parameter of the machine is used to learn the weights of the neural network so that the difference between the output value changing in accordance with the values of the operating parameters of the machine and training data corresponding to the values of the operating parameters of the machine becomes smaller.
