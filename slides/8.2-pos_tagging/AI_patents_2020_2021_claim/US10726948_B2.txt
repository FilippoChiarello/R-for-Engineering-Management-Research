<title>
Medical imaging device- and display-invariant segmentation and measurement
</title>

<abstract>
Medical imaging device- and display-invariant segmentation and measurement is provided. In various embodiments, a plurality of medical images is read from a data store. Metadata of each of the plurality of medical images is read. The metadata identifies an image acquisition device associated with each of the plurality of medical images. Based on the plurality of medical images and the metadata of each of the plurality of images, a learning system is trained to determine one or more image correction parameters. The one or more image correction parameters optimize segmentation of the plurality of medical images.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: reading a plurality of medical images from a data store; reading metadata of each of the plurality of medical images, the metadata identifying an image acquisition device associated with each of the plurality of medical images; based on the plurality of medical images and the metadata of each of the plurality of images, training a learning system to determine one or more image correction parameters, the one or more image correction parameters adapted to optimize the plurality of medical images for segmentation.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: after training, applying the learning system to determine one or more image correction parameters of an additional medical image.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: applying the determined one or more image correction parameters to the additional medical image to thereby generate a corrected medical image; and segmenting the corrected medical image.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein training the learning system comprises: determining a segmentation of each of the plurality of medical images; comparing the segmentation to ground truth.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: training the learning system to determine one or more segmentation parameters, the one or more segmentation parameters optimizing segmentation of the plurality of medical images.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising: determining an expected error range of the segmentation.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more image correction parameters includes window, level, noise, or smoothing.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the metadata further identifies one or more image acquisition parameter associated with each of the plurality of medical images.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more image correction parameters includes exposure, intensity, image reconstruction kernels, acquisition pixel and slice spacing, contrast agent dose amount, light power, noise, or contrast level.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the learning system comprises a genetic algorithm.
