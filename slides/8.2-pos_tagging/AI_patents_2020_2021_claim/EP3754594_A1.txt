INSPECTION DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
It is an object of the invention to provide an inspection device that can inhibit a reduction in the accuracy of inspections of goods that include plural articles that sometimes overlap each other. An X-ray inspection device (10) irradiates, with radiation, goods (G) containing plural articles (A) having a predetermined shape and inspects the goods (G) on the basis of inspection images obtained from radiation that has passed through the goods (G) or radiation that has reflected off the goods (G). The X-ray inspection device (10) includes a storage component (51), a learning component (52c), and an inspection component (52d). The storage component (51) stores, as teaching images, at least the inspection images of the goods (G) that are in a state in which the plural articles (A) overlap each other. The learning component (52c) acquires, by machine learning using the teaching images stored in the storage component (51), features relating to the goods (G) that are in a state in which the plural articles (A) overlap each other. The inspection component (52d) inspects the goods (G) using the features that the learning component (52c) has acquired.

<claims>
1. An inspection device configured to irradiate, with radiation, goods containing plural articles having a predetermined shape and inspect the goods on the basis of inspection images obtained from radiation that has passed through the goods or radiation that has reflected off the goods, the inspection device comprising: a storage component configured to store, as teaching images, at least the inspection images of the goods that are in a state in which the plural articles overlap each other; a learning component configured to acquire, by machine learning using the teaching images stored in the storage component, features relating to the goods that are in a state in which the plural articles overlap each other; and an inspection component configured to inspect the goods using the features that the learning component has acquired.
2. The inspection device according to claim 1, wherein the inspection component is configured to inspect for the presence or absence of contaminants included in the goods.
3. The inspection device according to claim 2, wherein
the storage component is configured to store, as the teaching images, at least the inspection images of the goods that include contaminants, and
the learning component is configured to acquire the features by machine learning using the teaching images and regions in the teaching images where there are contaminants included in the goods.
4. The inspection device according to claim 2 or 3, wherein
the storage component is configured to store, as the teaching images, at least images in which images of virtual contaminants have been incorporated into the inspection images of the goods that do not include contaminants, and
the learning component is configured to acquire the features by machine learning using the teaching images and regions in the teaching images where there are the virtual contaminants.
5. The inspection device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the inspection component is configured to inspect the quantities of the articles contained in the goods.
6. The inspection device according to claim 5, wherein the learning component is configured to acquire the features by machine learning using the teaching images and the quantities of the articles contained in the goods in the teaching images.
7. The inspection device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the inspection component is further configured to inspect the goods on the basis of the inspection images without using the features.
8. The inspection device according to claim 7, wherein the inspection component is configured to inspect the goods on the basis of inspection results of the goods in a case where it has used the features and inspection results of the goods in a case where it has not used the features.
