</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the disclosure relate to a computing system, computer-implemented method, and computer readable storage media for predicting, for a consumer in a group of consumers assigned to a subset of consumers in a plurality of subsets at the present time, which subset the consumer will be assigned to at a predetermined time in the future. Further aspects of the disclosure relate to a computer-implemented method for determining the likelihood that consumers in a group of consumers will migrate between subsets in a plurality of subsets of consumers. Further aspects of the disclosure related to a computer-implemented method for determining an expected revenue for a group of consumers at a predetermined time in the future.
