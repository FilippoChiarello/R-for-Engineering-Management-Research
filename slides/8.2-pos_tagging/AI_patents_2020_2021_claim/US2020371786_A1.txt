Method and Apparatus for Dual Issue Multiply Instructions
</title>

<abstract>
A method is provided that includes performing, by a processor in response to a dual issue multiply instruction, multiplication of operands of the dual issue multiply instruction using multiplication units comprised in a data path of the processor and configured to operate together to determine a product of the operands, and storing, by the processor, the product in a storage location indicated by the dual issue multiply instruction.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising: performing, by a processor in response to a dual issue multiply instruction, multiplication of a first operand and a second operand of the dual issue multiply instruction using a first multiplication unit and a second multiplication unit comprised in a data path of the processor and configured to operate together to determine a product of the first and second operands; and storing, by the processor, the product in a storage location indicated by the dual issue multiply instruction.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein performing further comprises: determining first partial product terms for a most significant half of the first operand and the second operand in the first multiplication unit and second partial product terms for a least significant half of the first operand and the second operand in the second multiplication unit; and determining the product in the first multiplication unit using the first partial product terms and the second partial product terms.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the data path is a scalar data path and the dual issue multiply instruction is a scalar multiply instruction.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the data path is a vector data path and the dual issue multiply instruction is a vector multiply instruction.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: performing, by the processor responsive to a first single issue multiply instruction and a second single issue multiply instruction, multiplication of operands of the first single issue multiply instruction using the first multiplication unit and multiplication of operands of the second single issue multiply instruction using the second multiplication unit, wherein the first and second single issue multiply instructions are executed in parallel; and storing, by the processor, a result of the first single multiply instruction in a storage location indicated by the first single issue multiply instruction and a result of the second single issue multiply instruction in a storage location indicated by the second single issue multiply instruction.
6. A processor comprising: a first multiplication unit in a first data path of the processor; and a second multiplication unit in the first data path; wherein the first multiplication unit and the second multiplication unit are configured to operate together to execute dual issue multiply instructions.
7. The processor of claim 6, wherein the first data path is a scalar data path and the dual issue multiply instructions are scalar multiply instructions.
8. The processor of claim 6, wherein the first data path is a vector data path and the dual issue multiply instructions are vector multiply instructions.
9. The processor of claim 6, wherein the first multiplication unit is further configured to determine first partial product terms for a most significant half of the first operand and the second operand, the second multiplication unit is further configured to determine second partial product terms for a least significant half of the first operand and the second operand, and the first multiplication unit is further configured to determine the product using the first partial product terms and the second partial product terms.
10. The processor of claim 6, wherein the first data path is a vector data path organized in a plurality of slices; the first multiplication unit comprises a slice multiplication component for each slice in the plurality of slices; and the second multiplication unit comprises a slice multiplication component for each slice of the plurality of slices, wherein for each slice of the plurality of slices, the slice multiplication component for the slice in the first multiplication unit and the slice multiplication component for the slice in the second multiplication unit are configured to operate together to determine a product of an element corresponding to the slice in the first operand and an element corresponding to the slice in the second operand.
11. The processor of claim 6, wherein the first multiplication unit and the second multiplication unit are further configured to execute respective single issue multiply instructions in parallel.
12. The processor of claim 6, wherein the processor is a digital signal processor (DSP).
