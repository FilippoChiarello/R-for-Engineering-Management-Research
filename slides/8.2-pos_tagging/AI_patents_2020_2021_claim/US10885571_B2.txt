12. A computer program product, comprising: a non-transitory computer readable storage medium having computer readable program code embodied therewith, the computer readable program code executable by a processor and comprising: computer readable program code configured to receive, at a data service provider comprising a cloud marketplace and a security advisor, a request from an information purchaser, wherein the request comprises (i) a budget identifying an amount of money to be spent on information included by at least one information seller on the cloud marketplace and (ii) an objective function identifying a type of information that the information purchaser is requesting, wherein the security advisor acts as an intermediary between information sellers on the cloud marketplace and information purchasers to facilitate information set purchases and reduce disclosure of information of the information sellers to information purchasers; computer readable program code configured to access, by the security advisor, at least a subset of at least one information set available for purchase from the at least one information seller, wherein the at least a subset is made accessible to the security advisor by the at least one information seller; computer readable program code configured to identify, by the security advisor, at least one accessed information set that fulfills the received request, wherein the identifying comprises transforming the request and the at least a subset of the at least information set into a format analyzable by the security advisor and into matching formats by parsing, utilizing a parsing engine, the request and the at least a subset of the at least one information set, wherein the identifying comprises comparing the parsed request to the parsed at least a subset of the at least one information set, wherein the comparing comprises determining a number of matches between the parsed request and the parsed at least a subset of the at least one information set by analyzing, utilizing an analytics engine, the parsed request and the parsed at least a subset of the at least one information set, wherein the identifying comprises determining, using the analytics engine, a quality of the at least a subset of the at least one information set with respect to the information purchaser in view of the objective function; and computer readable program code configured to provide, by the security advisor, a recommendation of an information set for purchase by the information purchaser, wherein the provided recommendation comprises at least one of the identified information sets that fulfills the received request.
