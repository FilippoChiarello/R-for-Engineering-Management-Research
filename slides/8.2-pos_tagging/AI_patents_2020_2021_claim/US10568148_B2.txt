Systems and methods for communicating notices within a vehicle using a mobile device
</title>

<abstract>
System, methods, and other embodiments described herein relate to controlling a mobile device to provide notices within a vehicle. In one embodiment, a method includes, in response to an electronic signal indicating an occurrence of an event associated with the vehicle, identifying whether a mobile device is actively in use by a passenger of the vehicle. The method further includes determining a viewing orientation for a display of the mobile device by analyzing state information from the mobile device about a present mode of operation for the display in relation to a relative alignment with the vehicle. The method also includes controlling the mobile device to display the notice according to the viewing orientation by wirelessly instructing the mobile device to render the notice on the display as a function of the viewing orientation to display the notice relative to an alignment between the vehicle and the mobile device.
