DATA BREACH PREVENTION AND REMEDIATION
</title>

<abstract>
Computer-implemented threat detection method and systems are provided. The method comprises discovering threat data associated with a first entity, translating the threat data to one or more threat models, translating the one or more threat models, using a threat model parameter generator, to at least a parameter threat model and translating the parameter threat model to one or more identification queries. The one or more identification queries may be executed and the generated results may be translated to result data in a first format. The one or more result data models may be published from the result data in one or more formats or to one or more locations.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented threat detection method comprising: discovering threat data associated with a first entity; translating the threat data to one or more threat models; translating the one or more threat models, using a threat model parameter generator, to at least a parameter threat model; translating the parameter threat model to one or more identification queries; executing the one or more identification queries and translating generated results to result data in a first format; and publish one or more result data models from the result data in one or more formats or to one or more locations.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the result data is aggregated and translated to a second format based on a format suitable for use by the first entity.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the result data is translated to a second format based on a format suitable for a computing technology used by the first entity.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the treat data includes indicators of financial compromise (IOFC).
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the IOFC is associated with at least one of partial account information, compromised login information, malware netflow, malicious proxy sessions, compromised card information and phishing domains.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the parameter threat model includes parameters associated with at least one of equality, inequality, full text, and partial text matches, wherein the parameters are used to identify a threat target associated with the first entity.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the parameter threat model is collected from a parameter model interface to translate the parameter threat model into the one or more identification queries based on computing technology or configuration used by the first entity's database implementation.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the computing technology is associated with at least one of a database query language or a distributed search engine utilized by the first entity for managing data.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the result data model includes at least one of the first entity's unique customer identifier, compromise timestamp, threat tag, attribution tag, provider tag and feed tag from the result data.
10. The method of claim 4, wherein a single IOFC is utilized to create several threat models of the same or different threat model types.
11. A system comprising:
at least one programmable processor; and a non-transitory machine-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by the at least one programmable processor, cause the at least one programmable processor to perform operations comprising: discovering threat data associated with a first entity; translating the threat data to one or more threat models; translating the one or more threat models, using a threat model parameter generator, to at least a parameter threat model; translating the parameter threat model to one or more identification queries; executing the one or more identification queries and translating generated results to result data in a first format; and publish one or more result data models from the result data in one or more formats or to one or more locations.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the result data is aggregated and translated to a second format based on a format suitable for use by the first entity.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the result data is translated to a second format based on a format suitable for a computing technology used by the first entity.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the treat data includes indicators of financial compromise (IOFC).
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the IOFC is associated with at least one of partial account information, compromised login information, malware netflow, malicious proxy sessions, compromised card information and phishing domains.
16. A computer program product comprising a non-transitory machine-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by at least one programmable processor, cause the at least one programmable processor to perform operations comprising:
discovering threat data associated with a first entity; translating the threat data to one or more threat models; translating the one or more threat models, using a threat model parameter generator, to at least a parameter threat model; translating the parameter threat model to one or more identification queries; executing the one or more identification queries and translating generated results to result data in a first format; and publish one or more result data models from the result data in one or more formats or to one or more locations.
17. The computer program product of claim 16, wherein the result data is aggregated and translated to a second format based on a format suitable for use by the first entity.
18. The computer program product of claim 16, wherein the result data is translated to a second format based on a format suitable for a computing technology used by the first entity.
19. The computer program product of claim 16, wherein the treat data includes indicators of financial compromise (IOFC).
20. The computer program product of claim 19, wherein the IOFC is associated with at least one of partial account information, compromised login information, malware netflow, malicious proxy sessions, compromised card information and phishing domains.
