SYSTEM FOR DISPENSING A COSMETIC PRODUCT
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a system (10) for dispensing a product, comprising a dispenser that can house at least two cartridges, each of which includes a reservoir containing a base product, a first base product comprising at least 0.1 wt.-% particles having a density differential relative to the medium containing same, preferably of at least 0.5 g/cm3, in particular particles having a density greater than or equal to 2 g/cm3, and a thickening agent. The dispenser allows at least two base products to be dispensed in adjustable proportions, the viscosity of the first base product being preferably greater than 2 Pa·s and more preferably greater than or equal to 4 Pa·s.

<claims>
1. A system for dispensing a product, comprising a dispenser that receives at least two cartridges that each have a reservoir comprising a base product, a first base product comprising at least 0.1% by mass of particles exhibiting a difference in density with a medium which contains them, the particles having a density greater than or equal to 2 g/cm3, and a thickener, the dispenser making it possible to deliver at least two base products in adjustable proportions, the viscosity of the first base product being greater than 2 Pa·s.
2. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the viscosity of the first base product is greater than or equal to 4 Pa·s.
3. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the dispenser receives a second cartridge containing a second base product having a viscosity less than that of the first base product.
4. The system as claimed in claim 3, wherein the second base product has a viscosity less than or equal to 1 Pa·s.
5. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the density of said particles is greater than or equal to 5 g/cm3.
6. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the particles comprise at least one selected from the group consisting of bismuth oxychloride, cerium oxide, chromium oxide, zirconium oxide, iron oxide, titanium oxide, talc, calcium carbonate, silica, boron nitride, and tungsten carbide.
7. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the second product does not have any particles with a density greater than or equal to 7 g/cm3.
8. The system as claimed in claim 1, which comprises a third cartridge with a third base product.
9. The system as claimed in claim 8, wherein the third base product comprises a thickener identical to or different than that of the first base product.
10. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the thickener of the first base product is selected from the group consisting of saccharide compounds of the rubber type, cellulose-based compounds, synthetic polymers, polyacrylic or polymethacrylic acids, polyurethanes, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, inverse or direct thick emulsions, combinations of non-aqueous solvents with thickening agents for oil, clays, attapulgite, organochelators, proteins, and shear-thinning or thixotropic rheology agents.
11. The system as claimed in claim 10, wherein the thickener of the first base product is chosen from saccharide compounds of the rubber type, mass content being between 0.1% and 5% relative to the total mass of the first base product.
12. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the cartridges are received in a removable manner in the dispenser.
13. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein each product leaves the cartridge through an outlet passage of the cartridge, the outlet passage being defined by a dispensing end piece of the cartridge, said end piece being driven in rotation relative to a body of the cartridge by a drive mechanism of the dispenser in order to dispense the base product contained in the cartridge.
14. The system as claimed in claim 1, which comprises a mechanism for homogenizing the first base product.
15. The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first base product comprises at least 0.1% by mass of particles exhibiting a difference in density of at least 0.5 g/cm3 with the medium which contains them.
