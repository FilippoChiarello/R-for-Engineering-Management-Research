HEALTHCARE OPTIMIZATION SYSTEMS AND METHODS TO PREDICT AND OPTIMIZE A PATIENT AND CARE TEAM JOURNEY AROUND MULTI-FACTOR OUTCOMES
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for patient healthcare plan optimization. An optimization system includes a user interface, an optimizer and an influencer system. The user interface receives data including multi-factor determinants of a patient and a plurality of treatment personnel. The multi-factor determinants include at least one of clinical, behavioral, psychosocial, organizational and economic characteristics. The optimizer generates an electronic patient journey plan for the patient, by identifying one or more personnel among the treatment personnel to form a care team, roles for each selected personnel of the care team and actions for each of the care team and the patient, based on optimization of the multi-factor determinants of the patient and the treatment personnel according to one or more optimization algorithms. The influencer system determines software influencer instructions to be performed by designated influencers based on the electronic patient journey plan.
