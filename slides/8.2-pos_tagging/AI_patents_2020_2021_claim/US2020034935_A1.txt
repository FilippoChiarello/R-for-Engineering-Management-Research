SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR INTELLIGENT SUBSIDENCE RISK ANALYSIS USING GIS DATA
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are systems and a method for intelligent subsidence risk analysis using GIS data. More specifically the intelligent subsidence risk analysis using GIS data includes vegetation data. In one aspect, GIS data is used to analyze vegetation (trees) in the vicinity of the real estate property. Based on the vegetation, estimate of soil can also be done and combining the vegetation data, soil data and other data overall subsidence risk is estimated. As per yet another aspect of the disclosure, GIS data is obtained using commercial mapping systems and combined with public data.
