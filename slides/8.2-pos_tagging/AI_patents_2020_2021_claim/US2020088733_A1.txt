BIOMARKERS AND METHODS FOR DIAGNOSIS OF EARLY STAGE PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention provides biomarker compositions and methods for the diagnosis and prognosis of PDAC. In a particular embodiment, the invention provides methods and compositions for screening, diagnosis and prognosis of early stage, asymptomatic PDAC.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A panel of isolated biomarkers comprising N of the biomarkers listed in Tables 1 through 4.
2. The panel of claim 1, wherein N is a number selected from the group consisting of 2 to 30.
3. The panel of claim 2, wherein said panel comprises at least two isolated biomarkers selected from the group consisting of the biomarkers set forth in Tables 1 through 4.
4. The panel of claim 2, wherein said panel comprises basigin (BSG).
5. The panel of claim 2, wherein said panel comprises soluble hyaluronic acid (HA).
6. A method of determining a probability for early stage pancreatic ductal adenoncarcinoma (PDAC) in an individual, the method comprising detecting a measurable feature of each of N biomarkers selected from the biomarkers listed in Tables 1 through 4 in a biological sample obtained from said individual, and analyzing said measurable feature to determine the probability for early stage PDAC in said individual.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein said measurable feature comprises fragments or derivatives of each of said N biomarkers selected from the biomarkers listed in Tables 1 through 4.
8. The method of claim 6, wherein said detecting a measurable feature comprises quantifying an amount of each of N biomarkers selected from the biomarkers listed in Tables 1 through 4, combinations or portions and/or derivatives thereof in a biological sample obtained from said individual.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising calculating the probability for early stage PDAC in said individual based on said quantified amount of each of N biomarkers selected from the biomarkers listed in Tables 1 through 4.
10. The method of claim 6, further comprising an initial step of providing a biomarker panel comprising N of the biomarkers listed in Tables 1 through 4.
11. The method of claim 6, further comprising an initial step of providing a biological sample from the individual.
12. The method of claim 6, further comprising communicating said probability to a health care provider.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein said communication informs a subsequent treatment decision for said individual.
14. The method of claim 6, wherein N is a number selected from the group consisting of 2 to 30.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein said N biomarkers comprise basigin (BSG).
16. The method of claim 14, wherein said N biomarkers comprise soluble hyaluronic acid (HA).
17. The method of claim 6, wherein said analysis comprises a use of a predictive model.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein said analysis comprises comparing said measurable feature with a reference feature.
19. The method of claim 6, wherein the biological sample is selected from the group consisting of whole blood, plasma, and serum.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein the biological sample is serum.
21. The method of claim 8, wherein said quantifying comprises an assay that utilizes a capture agent.
22. The method of claim 21, wherein said capture agent is selected from the group consisting of and antibody, antibody fragment, nucleic acid-based protein binding reagent, small molecule or variant thereof.
23. The method of claim 22, wherein said assay is selected from the group consisting of enzyme immunoassay (EIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and radioimmunoassay (RIA).
24. The method of claim 6, further comprising detecting a measurable feature for one or more risk indicia.
25. A method of determining a probability for recurrence of PDAC in an individual, the method comprising detecting a measurable feature of each of N biomarkers selected from the biomarkers listed in Tables 1 through 4 in a biological sample obtained from said individual, and analyzing said measurable feature to determine the probability for for recurrence of PDAC in said individual.
26. A method of determining a probability of a positive response to therapy for pancreatic ductal adenoncarcinoma (PDAC) in an individual, the method comprising detecting a measurable feature of each of N biomarkers selected from the biomarkers listed in Tables 1 through 4 in a biological sample obtained from said individual, and analyzing said measurable feature to determine the probability of a positive response to therapy for PDAC in said individual.
27. The method of claim 26, wherein said therapy is selected from the group consisting of prophylactic anticoagulants, resection, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation.
