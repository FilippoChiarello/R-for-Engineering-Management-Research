<title>
CHEMORECEPTOR STIMULUS FOR SEDATION STATUS ASCERTAINMENT
</title>

<abstract>
A system (SYS) and related method for imaging support. The system (SYS) comprises a stimulus delivery component (SDC) configured to cause a chemoreceptor stimulus in a patient residing in or at an imaging apparatus (IA). A response measuring component (RMC) measure a response of the patient to the stimulus, and a decision logic (DL) establishes, based on the measured response, a sedation status of the patient for the purpose of imaging the patient. An imaging operation can be modified, for instance, halted if the patient is no longer sufficiently sedated.

<claims>
1. A system (SYS) for imaging support, comprising: - a stimulus delivery component (SDC) configured to cause a chemoreceptor stimulus in a patient residing in or at an imaging apparatus (IA); - a response measuring component (RMC) configured to measure a response of the patient to the stimulus; and - a decision logic (DL) configured to establish, based on the measured response, a sedation status of the patient for the purpose of imaging the patient.
2. System of claim 1, wherein the decision logic (DL) is further to provide, based on the established sedation status, at least one of i) a control signal to control the imaging apparatus and/or ii) an indication on the sedation status and/or on how to operate the imaging apparatus.
3. System of claim 1 or 2, wherein the causing by the stimulus delivery component (SDC) of the stimulus comprises any one or more of: i) providing a substance to the patient capable of stimulating a chemoreceptor of the patient or ii) applying an electrical signal to a chemoreceptor of the patient.
4. System of any one of the previous claims, wherein the decision logic comprises a pre-trained machine learning component (MLC).
5. System of any one of the previous claim, wherein the stimulus delivery component (SDC) comprises any one or more of: i) a portable device configured for oral placement and configured to electrically induce a taste sensation in a patient by having electrodes of the device in contact with at least a part of the patient's tongue when so placed, and configured to apply a voltage across the electrodes driven by a power source ii) a portable device configured for oral placement, having at least one container including a tastant or odorant, the device configured to release a quantum of said tastant upon the device receiving a trigger signal, iii) a tube arrangement in fluid communication with a container including a tastant or odorant, and a pump configured to pump a quantum of the tastant or odorant from the container, through the tube arrangement, to a terminal end thereof, so as to dispense the quantum of tastant or odorant at the patients mouth or nose, iv) a jet-delivery system including a nozzle through which an odorant is delivered as an aerosol.
6. System of claim 5, wherein the power source is based on inductive coupling.
7. System of any one of the previous claims, wherein the response measuring component (RMC) comprises a sensor arrangement capable of measuring any one or more in relation to the patient: i) a galvanic skin response [GSR] signal, ii) a facial gesture, iii) a body gesture, iv) an uttered sound, v) a vital sign.
8. System of any one of the previous claims, wherein the stimulus is caused in a sequence of different intensities.
9. Method (500) of training the machine learning component (MLC) as per claim 4.
10. Method (400) of imaging support, comprising the steps of: - causing (S410) a chemoreceptor stimulus in a patient residing in or at an imaging apparatus (IA); - measuring (S420) a response of the patient to the stimulus; and - establishing (S430), based on the measured response, a sedation status of the patient for the purpose of imaging the patient.
11. A method (700) for chemoreceptor stimulus based sedation control, comprising the steps of: - receiving (S710) training data comprising patient data and stimulant data, the stimulant data comprising a combination of different base tastes; and - applying (S720) a machine learning algorithm to the training data to learn a relationship between the patient data and the stimulant data.
12. Method of claim 11, further comprising: - predicting (S730), based on the learned relationship, new stimulant data given new patient data of a patient to be imaged; and - stimulating (S740) the patient based on the new stimulant data to establish a sedation status of the patient.
13. An imaging arrangement (IA), comprising: - a system of any one of previous claims 1-8; - the imaging apparatus (IA).
14. A computer program element, which, when being executed by at least one processing unit (PU), is adapted to cause the processing unit (PU) to perform the method as per any one of claims 9-12.
15. A computer readable medium having stored thereon the program element of claim 14.
