<title>
MACHINE LEARNING-BASED VARIANT CALLING USING SEQUENCING DATA COLLECTED FROM DIFFERENT SUBJECTS
</title>

<abstract>
An example computer-implemented genotyping method includes identifying a locus of interest from a reference sequence; and obtaining sequencing data collected from a target subject. The sequencing data collected from the target subject includes a plurality of sequencing reads collected from the target subject using a hardware sequencing machine. The method further includes: aligning each sequencing read in the plurality of sequencing reads collected from the target subject based on the locus of interest identified from the reference sequence to produce a plurality of aligned sequencing reads; obtaining genotype data from a plurality of baseline subjects, wherein the plurality of baseline subjects are subjects different from the target subject; and identifying a genotype for the target subject at the locus of interest identified from the reference sequence based on (1) the plurality of aligned sequencing reads and (2) the genotype data obtained from a plurality of baseline subjects.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented genotyping method, comprising: identifying a locus of interest from a reference sequence; obtaining sequencing data collected from a target subject, wherein the sequencing data collected from the target subject includes a plurality of sequencing reads collected from the target subject using a hardware sequencing machine; aligning each sequencing read in the plurality of sequencing reads collected from the target subject based on the locus of interest identified from the reference sequence to produce a plurality of aligned sequencing reads; obtaining genotype data from a plurality of baseline subjects, wherein the plurality of baseline subjects are subjects different from the target subject; and identifying a genotype for the target subject at the locus of interest identified from the reference sequence based on (1) the plurality of aligned sequencing reads; and (2) the genotype data obtained from a plurality of baseline subjects.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the genotype data includes one or more genotypes determined for one or more loci for the plurality of baseline subjects.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the one or more loci include the locus of interest.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the one or more loci exclude the locus of interest.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein the one or more loci include the locus of interest and at least one locus other than the locus of interest.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the genotype data includes a second plurality of aligned sequencing reads collected from the plurality of baseline subjects.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising: aligning each sequencing read in the second plurality of sequencing reads collected from the baseline subjects based on the locus of interest identified from the reference sequence to produce a second plurality of aligned sequencing reads collected from the baseline subjects.
8. The method of claim 6, wherein the aligned sequencing reads of the plurality of baseline subjects include sequencing reads including the locus of interest and one or more loci other than the locus of interest.
9. The method in claim 8, wherein the one or more loci other than the locus of interest include varied loci that are within a predefined distance from the locus of interest.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the varied loci include loci with minor allele frequency greater than a predetermined threshold within the plurality of baseline subjects.
11. The method of claim 6, wherein the aligned sequencing reads of the plurality of baseline subjects include sequencing reads that do not include the locus of interest.
12. The method of claim 6, wherein the aligned sequencing reads of the plurality of baseline subjects include sequencing reads that include only the locus of interest.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying the genotype for the target subject at the locus of interest identified from the reference sequence includes applying a machine learning-based classification algorithm, wherein the machine learning-based classification algorithm is trained in accordance with samples with known genotypes.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the machine learning-based classification algorithm uses a classification method is selected from one of: a Naive Baise (NB) classification method, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification method, a Logistic Regression (LR) classification method, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method, and a Random Forest (RF) classification method.
15. The method of claim 14, where a feature selection method is used in conjunction with the classification method.
16. The method of claim 13, wherein the machine learning-based classification algorithm uses a classification method selected from one of: a deep fully-connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classification method, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification method, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) classification method, or a classification method derived from a network structure derived from any of the preceding network structures.
17. The method of claim 1, wherein the hardware sequencing machine is a next-generation sequencing equipment and the next-generation sequencing equipment is an Illumina, Ion Torrent, Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore sequencing machine.
18. The method of claim 16, wherein the next-generation sequencing equipment is a high throughput sequencing machine.
19. The method of claim 1 is executed by a computer that is different and separate from the hardware sequencing machine.
20. The method of claim 1, where identifying the genotype for the target subject at the locus of interest identified from the reference sequence is further based on (3) genotype data determined for one or more loci other than the locus of interest for the target subject.
