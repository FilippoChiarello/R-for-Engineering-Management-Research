SYSTEM AND METHODS TO SHARE MACHINE LEARNING FUNCTIONALITY BETWEEN CLOUD AND AN IOT NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
A system and methods are provided for using deep learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) as applied to Internet of Things (IoT) networks that includes a plurality of sensing nodes and aggregating nodes. Events of interest are detected based on collected data with higher reliability, and the IoT network improves bandwidth usage by dividing processing functionality between the IoT network and a cloud computing network.
