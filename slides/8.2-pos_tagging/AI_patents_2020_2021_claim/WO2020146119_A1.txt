<title>
COMPOSITIONAL MODEL FOR TEXT RECOGNITION
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments relate to a two-stage end-to-end text recognition system. The text recognition system includes a text detection stage and a text recognition stage. Images inputted to the text recognition system are provided to both the text detection stage and to the text recognition stage. The text detection stage detects text regions in the images and provides the detected regions to the text recognition stage. The text recognition stage is trained to perform geometric rectification on the text regions using the images. There is end-to-end alignment between the text detection stage and the text recognition stage. Additionally, the text detection stage and text recognition stage are each trained independent of the other.

<claims>
1. A method performed by one or more computing devices, the method comprising:
training a neural network with training data comprised of training images of training text and ground truth text that corresponds to the images of the training text, the trained neural network being configured to recognize text in images inputted thereto; receiving an image comprised of image data, the image including a region comprised of image data representing text;
performing text detection on the image to detect the region of the image;
passing the image to the trained neural network;
based on the detection of the region, providing an indication of the region to the trained neural network, wherein the trained neural network recognizes text in and around the region of the image detected by the text detection.
2. A method according to claim 1, wherein the trained neural network, after recognizing the text near an indicated region, outputs the recognized text and a rectification of the region to the nearby text.
3. A method according to claim 2, wherein the rectified region includes a portion of the image that was not included in the region detected by the text detection, wherein the portion of the image includes image data representing some of the recognized text, and wherein the portion is used by the neural network when recognizing the text.
4. A method according to claim 1, the trained neural network comprises modules or layers that correspond to an inverse of a compositional model, the compositional model modeling generation of word images from corresponding text.
5. A method according to claim 4, wherein the compositional model comprises a kerning function that models kerning of text.
6. A method according to claim 5, wherein the compositional model further comprises a composition of the kerning function and one or more of: a skeletonization function, a font function, an appearance function, or a geometry function.
7. A method according to claim 1, wherein the trained neural network models geometric distortion of text and models noise of the text detection.
8. A computing device comprising:
processing hardware;
storage hardware storing information configured to, when executed by the processing hardware, cause the processing hardware to implement a text detector and a text recognizer;
the text detector configured to detect, in images inputted thereto, regions containing text, and to output indicia of the regions to a trained neural network;
the trained neural network configured to receive the images and the indicia of the regions of text detected by the text detector, wherein the trained neural network comprises nodes and interconnections therebetween that have been trained to correspond to an inverse of a compositional model for generating images of text.
9. A computing device according to claim 8, wherein the compositional model comprises at least three of: a transcription and/or skeletonization function, a kerning function, a typesetting function, an appearance function, and a geometric distortion function.
10. A computing device according to claim 8, wherein the trained neural network comprises a geometric rectification module or layer, a typesetting module or layer, and a kerning module.
11. A computing device according to claim 8, wherein the trained neural network comprises a spatial transformer network (STN) module/layer feeding a convolutional encoding module/layer.
12. A computing device according to claim 11, wherein STN module/layer receives an image and an indication of a region of text therein and outputs, to the convolutional encoding module/layer, a rectified crop of the image.
13. A computing device according to claim 8, wherein the trained neural network comprises a text recognition module/layer that is directly or indirectly fed by an STN module.
14. Computer-readable storage hardware storing instructions configured to cause a computing device to perform a process, the process comprising:
providing a two-stage end-to-end text recognition system comprising a text detection stage and a text recognition stage, wherein images inputted to the text recognition system are provided to the text detection stage and to the text recognition stage, wherein the text detection stage detects text regions in the images and provides the detected regions to the text recognition stage, wherein there is end-to-end alignment between the text detection stage and the text recognition stage, wherein the text detection stage and text recognition stage are each trained independent of the other, and wherein the text recognition stage is trained to perform geometric rectification on the text regions using the images.
15. Computer-readable storage hardware according to claim 14, wherein, for a given text region, when the text recognition stage recognizes text within the given text region, the text recognition stage recognizes portions of that text that are outside of and adjacent to the given text region, and wherein when the given text region is rectified the rectification of the given text region encompasses the portions of text.
