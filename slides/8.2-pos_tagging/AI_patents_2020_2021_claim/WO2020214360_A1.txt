SYSTEM FOR THROUGHPUT INCREASES FOR OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed in some examples, are optical devices, systems, and machine-readable mediums that send and receive multiple streams of data across a same optical communication path (e.g., a same fiber optic fiber) with a same wavelength using different light sources transmitting at different power levels - thereby increasing the bandwidth of each optical communication path. Each light source corresponding to each stream transmits at a same frequency and on the same optical communication path using a different power level. The receiver differentiates the data for each stream by applying one or more detection models to the photon counts observed at the receiver to determine likely bit assignments for each stream.

<claims>
1. A system for transmitting data using light, the system comprising:
a first light source configured to transmit a first data stream at a first power level and on a first wavelength to a receiver over a first optical communication path; and
a second light source configured to transmit a second data stream at a second power level different than the first power level and on the first wavelength to the receiver over the first optical communication path simultaneously to a transmission of the first data stream by the first light source.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the first optical communication path is a single fiber optic fiber.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the first and second light sources, when both activated, at least partially interfere with one another.
4. The system of claim 1, further comprising:
a receiver configured to receive the first and second data streams and utilize a plurality of detection models to recover the first data stream and the second data stream.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the first and second light sources, when both activated, interfere with one another at least sometimes on the first optical communication path and wherein the plurality of detection models are configured to account for the interference and wherein the receiver is configured to recover the first and second data streams despite the interference.
6. The system of claim 4, wherein the receiver is configured to recover the first and second data streams by inputting a photon count of received photons to the plurality of detection models.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein at least one of the plurality of detection models is a Poisson probability distribution.
8. The system of claim 6, wherein at least one of the plurality of detection models is a supervised learning neural network model.
9. The system of claim 6, wherein at least two of the plurality of detection models have different detection ranges.
10. The system of claim 6, wherein the receiver is configured to recover the first and second data streams by:
submitting a photon count to the plurality of detection models, each of the plurality of detection models corresponding to a bit assignment of the first and second data streams; and assigning a value to the first data stream and the second data stream equal to the corresponding bit assignment of the detection model that produces a highest probability given a photon count.
11. The system of claim 6, wherein the receiver is configured to instruct the first and second light sources to transmit a plurality of training sequences and the receiver is further configured to determine, from the training sequences, the plurality of detection models.
12. The system of claim 6, wherein the receiver is configured to communicate a power level assignment scheme to the first and second light sources, the power level assignment schemes specifying a power level used by the first and second light sources at a plurality of phases, including a phase in which the first light source transmits at the first power level and the second light source transmits at the second power level.
13. The system of claim 1, wherein the first and second light sources are contained in a same computing device.
14. The system of claim 1, wherein the first light source is contained in a first computing device and a second light source is contained in a second computing device.
15. The system of claim 1, wherein a controller of the first light source is configured to receive an instruction from the receiver indicating the first power level.
