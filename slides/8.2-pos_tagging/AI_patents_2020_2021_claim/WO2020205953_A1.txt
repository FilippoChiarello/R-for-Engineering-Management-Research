<title>
DISTALLY SHARED, AUGMENTED REALITY SPACE
</title>

<abstract>
In a method facilitating connectivity between at least first and second persons contemplates utilizing one or more computer processors to instantiate a first augmented reality space that mimics a real world space physically in existence about a first person. The first augmented reality space includes at least an avatar of the first person, and a first virtual representation of at least one real world object within the first augmented reality space. Using one or more computer processors, the method provides an interface through which the second person, distal to the first person, can use a second avatar to contemporaneously occupy and enter the first augmented reality space, traverse the space, and interact with the object.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method of facilitating connectivity between at least first and second persons, comprising: utilizing one or more computer processors to instantiate a first augmented reality space that mimics a real world space physically in existence about a first person, the first augmented reality space including at least an avatar of the first person, and a first virtual representation of at least one real world object within the first augmented reality space;
utilizing the one or more computer processors to provide an interface through which the second person, distal to the first person, can use a second avatar to enter the first augmented reality space, traverse the space, and interact with the object; and wherein the first and second avatar appear to the second person to contemporaneously occupy the first augmented reality space.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first avatar and the second avatar appear to the first person to contemporaneously occupy the first augmented reality space.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising utilizing the one or more computer processors to instantiate an interaction of the second person.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the second person has an additional augmented reality space about the second person, and wherein the first person accesses the additional augmented reality space.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein a third person has an additional augmented reality space about the third person.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising providing a portal form the first augmented reality space to the second augmented reality space.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising instantiating, by the one or more computer processors, a third augmented reality space that combines the first augmented reality space and the additional augmented reality space to create a combined space.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the combined space is at least one of an overlapped space, a stacked space, and an adjacent space.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the first person is within the first augmented reality space at the same time as the second person.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the first person is not within the first augmented reality space at the same time as the second person.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the first augmented reality space is a shared, distal augmented reality environment.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving program instructions from the first person to designate an object in the first augmented reality environment as confidential.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein designating the object as confidential causes the object to be at least one of hidden and censored.
