SYSTEM FOR MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF A CONSUMER PRODUCTS STOCK LIST
</title>

<abstract>
The present application describes a system for monitoring and management of a consumer products stock list, suitable for kitchen machines. The system is comprised by a consumer product supply platform, at least one kitchen machine, said kitchen machine further comprising a stock list management module comprising a detection unit, a memory unit and a communication unit. A communication link interconnects the communication unit of the kitchen machine's stock list management module to the consumer product marketing platform. With this system architecture, it is possible to automatically update the stock list containing consumer products as they are being used in the kitchen machine and, when needed, request for a replenishment of a specific ingredient or set of ingredients. Therefore, the intelligent management system proposed ensures that all the ingredients to be used in an automatic cooking program executed by a kitchen machine are in stock.
