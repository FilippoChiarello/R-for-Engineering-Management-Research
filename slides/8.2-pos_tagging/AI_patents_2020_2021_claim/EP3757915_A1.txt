METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR ADAPTIVE INVENTORY REPLENISHMENT
</title>

<abstract>
In an inventory management scenario, if inflow of goods is less than outflow of goods at any point of time any sale point, this leads to the sale point running out of stock. Manual inspection and stock keeping is prone to human errors, and also is done at the expense of dedicated human resources, which adds to cost of operation. The disclosure herein generally relates to inventory management, and, more particularly, to a method and system for adaptive inventory replenishment. The system collects real-time information on product-inflow, product-outflow, and damaged goods, as input, and processes the inputs to learn a product-replenishment pattern. Further, a replenishment policy that matches the learnt product-replenishment pattern is selected, and based on the selected replenishment policy, at least one product-replenishment recommendation for the collected real-time information is generated.

<claims>
1. A processor implemented method (300) of inventory replenishment, comprising: generating (302) a replenishment data model for a retail scenario using a reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, via one or more hardware processors, wherein generating the replenishment data model comprises modeling the retail scenario as a reinforcement learning model, wherein each state from among a plurality of states in the reinforcement learning model represents values of one or more parameters of a product-inflow, a product-outflow, and amount of damaged goods, at an instance of time; collecting (304) real-time information on product-inflow, product-outflow, and damaged goods, as input, via the one or more hardware processors; processing (306) the real-time information using the replenishment data model, via the one or more hardware processors; and generating (308) at least one product-replenishment recommendation to replenish one or more products, based on the real-time information and the replenishment data model, via the one or more hardware processors.
2. The processor implemented method (300) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the replenishment data model is generated using values of a plurality of historical product replenishment characteristics, product movement characteristics, and Product Life Cycle (PLC) characteristics.
3. The processor implemented method (300) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the at least one product-replenishment recommendation comprises calculated values for re-order quantity, order frequency, and safety stocks at one or more service levels.
4. A system (100) for inventory replenishment, comprising: one or more hardware processors (102); a communication interface (103); and a memory (101) comprising a plurality of instructions, wherein the plurality of instructions when executed, cause the one or more hardware processors to: generate a replenishment data model for a retail scenario using a reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, via one or more hardware processors, wherein generating the replenishment data model comprises modeling the retail scenario as a reinforcement learning model, wherein each state from among a plurality of states in the reinforcement learning model represents values of one or more parameters of a product-inflow, a product-outflow, and amount of damaged goods, at an instance of time; collect real-time information on product-inflow, product-outflow, and damaged goods, as input; process the real-time information using the replenishment data model; and generate at least one product-replenishment recommendation to replenish one or more products, based on the real-time information and the replenishment data model.
5. The system (100) as claimed in claim 4, wherein the system generates the replenishment data model using values of a plurality of historical product replenishment characteristics, product movement characteristics, and Product Life Cycle (PLC) characteristics.
6. The system (100) as claimed in claim 4, wherein the at least one product-replenishment recommendation comprises calculated values for re-order quantity, order frequency, and safety stocks at one or more service levels.
7. A non-transitory computer readable medium for inventory replenishment, the non-transitory computer readable medium performs the inventory replenishment by: generating a replenishment data model for a retail scenario using a reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, via one or more hardware processors, wherein generating the replenishment data model comprises modeling the retail scenario as a reinforcement learning model, wherein each state from among a plurality of states in the reinforcement learning model represents values of one or more parameters of a product-inflow, a product-outflow, and amount of damaged goods, at an instance of time; collecting real-time information on product-inflow, product-outflow, and damaged goods, as input, via the one or more hardware processors; processing the real-time information using the replenishment data model, via the one or more hardware processors; and generating at least one product-replenishment recommendation to replenish one or more products, based on the real-time information and the replenishment data model, via the one or more hardware processors.
8. The non-transitory computer readable medium as claimed in claim 7, wherein the non-transitory computer readable medium generates the replenishment data model using values of a plurality of historical product replenishment characteristics, product movement characteristics, and Product Life Cycle (PLC) characteristics.
9. The non-transitory computer readable medium as claimed in claim 7, wherein the at least one product-replenishment recommendation comprises calculated values for re-order quantity, order frequency, and safety stocks at one or more service levels.
