<title>
Machine learning models for detecting the causes of conditions of a satellite communication system
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for training and using machine learning models to detect problems in a satellite communication system. In some implementations, one or more feature vectors that respectively correspond to different times are obtained. The feature vector(s) are provided as input to one or more machine learning models trained to receive at least one feature vector that includes feature values representing properties of the satellite communication system and output an indication of potential causes of a condition of the satellite communication system based on the properties of the satellite communication system. A particular cause that is indicated as being a most likely cause of the condition of the satellite communication system is determined based on one or more machine learning model outputs received from each of the one or more machine learning models.
