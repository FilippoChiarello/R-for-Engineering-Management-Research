<title>
System and detecting and defending method for edge network
</title>

<abstract>
A computer system includes an openflow switch, configured to receive a plurality of packets; a network controller, coupled to the openflow switch and configured to determine a route of each of the plurality of packets; and a detecting and defending system, configured to perform transformation of information formats of the plurality of packets, retrieve and label the plurality of packets to determine whether the plurality of packets are abnormal or not and generate a defending determination.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer system, comprising: an openflow switch, configured to receive a plurality of packets; a network controller, coupled to the openflow switch and configured to determine a route of each of the plurality of packets; and a detecting and defending system, configured to perform transformation of information formats of the plurality of packets, retrieve and label the plurality of packets to determine whether the plurality of packets are abnormal or not and generate a defending determination: wherein the detecting and defending system comprises: a control module, coupled to the network controller via an interface and configured to update a plurality of openflow rules to a database; an analyze module, coupled to the network controller via the interface and configured to transform the information formats of the plurality of packets and label a plurality of signaling signatures corresponding to the information formats of the plurality of packets; an allocation module, coupled to the network controller via the interface and configured to perform an allocation of the plurality of packets according to the defending determination; a signature detecting module, coupled to the database and the analyze module, and configured to compare the plurality of signaling signatures corresponding to the information formats of the plurality of packets with the database to determine a first result; a deep learning module, coupled to the database and the analyze module, and configured to take the plurality of signaling signatures corresponding to the information formats of the plurality of packets as input information for classification of a deep neural network (DNN) to determine a second result; and a determination module, coupled to the signature detecting module and the deep learning module, and configured to generate the defending determination according to the first result and the second result; wherein when the first result is abnormal, the allocation module adopts a virtualized firewall to block a source IP of an attack; and when the first result is normal and the second result is abnormal, the allocation module limits a bandwidth of the attack to control the source IP of the attack.
2. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the database comprises a rule database, a signature database and a training model database, and the interface is configured to integrate the control module, the analyze module and the allocation module.
3. A detecting and defending method for an edge network, comprising: receiving a plurality of packets; performing transformation of information formats of the plurality of packets, retrieving and labeling the plurality of packets, to determine whether the plurality of packets are abnormal or not and generate a defending determination; and transferring the plurality of packets to a corresponding plurality of destinations, when the plurality of packets conform to a plurality of openflow rules; wherein the plurality of openflow rules are stored in a database; wherein the step of determining whether the plurality of packets are abnormal or not to generate the defending determination comprises: comparing the plurality of signaling signatures corresponding to the information formats of the plurality of packets with a database to determine a first result; taking the plurality of signaling signatures corresponding to the information formats of the plurality of packets as input information for classification of a deep neural network to determine a second result; and generating the defending determination according to the first result and the second result; when the first result is abnormal, adopting a virtualized firewall to block a source IP of an attack; and when the first result is normal and the second result is abnormal, limiting a bandwidth of the attack to control the source IP of the attack.
4. The detecting and defending method of claim 3, wherein the step of performing transformation of the information formats of the plurality of packets, retrieving and labeling the plurality of packets comprises: transforming the information formats of the plurality of packets; and labeling a plurality of signaling signatures corresponding to the information formats of the plurality of packets.
