SELECTING BEAMFORMING OPTIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A method, apparatus and computer program is described, comprising: collecting performance information, at a current iteration, of a current beamforming option at a node of a mobile communication system; updating a decision function for each of a plurality of beamforming options for the node of the mobile communication system, wherein updating the decision function uses the collected performance information of the current beamforming option at the current iteration; and selecting one of said beamforming options and operating the node of the communication system at a next iteration accordingly, wherein the selected beamforming option maximises the decision function. The method may make use of machine-learning principles.
