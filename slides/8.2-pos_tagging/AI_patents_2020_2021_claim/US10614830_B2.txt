System, method, and computer program for estimation of target value
</title>

<abstract>
A system, method, and computer program for estimation of a target value, which can change the aggregation of estimation results based on the degrees of confidence, taking the nature of an input observation signal into consideration. An unknown observation signal is input to a plurality of regression models. A plurality of estimated values are respectively obtained by a plurality of regression models corresponding to the plurality of features of the unknown observation signal. A target value of the unknown observation signal is estimated by aggregation of the target values. The estimating section calculates weights to be added the estimation results output from the regression models, based on the degrees of confidence with respect to the inputs into the regression models. A target value of the unknown observation signal is estimated through the aggregation by calculating a weighted sum of the estimation results output from the regression models.
