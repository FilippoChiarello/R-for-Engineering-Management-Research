OBJECT DESIGN USING MACHINE-LEARNING MODEL
</title>

<abstract>
A system to aid in design for manufacturing an object includes a processor and a memory configured to store instructions. The processor is configured to receive first data representing a design of the object to be manufactured and second data representing a machine-learning model. The processor is configured to execute the instructions to generate third data using the first data and the second data. The third data indicates at least one of a modification to the design of the object or process conditions for production of the object. The processor is configured to send the design of the object, the process conditions, or both, to a manufacturing tool to enable production of the object. The machine-learning model is representative of production data and based at least partially on one or more of: object features, process parameters, environmental factors, and quality data.

<claims>
1. A method (500) for manufacturing an object (100), the method comprising:
using a processor (112) to perform the steps of: receiving (502) first data (122) representing a design (120) of the object to be manufactured; obtaining (504) second data (124) representing a machine-learning model (126), the machine-learning model representative of production data (168) and based at least partially on one or more of: object features (176), process parameters (178), environmental factors (180), and quality data (182); generating (506) third data (128) using the first data and the second data, wherein the third data indicates at least one of a modification (130) to the design of the object or process conditions (132) for production of the object; and sending (510) the design of the object, the process conditions, or both, to a manufacturing tool (104) to enable production of the object.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine-learning model is updated using globally dispersed production data.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, further comprising using the processor to perform the step of generating (508) data indicative of a supply chain dispersion estimate (194), floor space estimate (196), or cost estimate (198) based on the design and the second data.
4. The method of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the production of the object includes an automated fiber placement (AFP) process (142).
5. The method of any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the modification includes adjusting at least one of an object geometry (202) or a ply angle (210).
6. The method of any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the process parameters include at least one of temperature (146), pressure (148), tension (150), or roller type (152).
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the environmental factors include at least one of ambient temperature (162) or humidity (164).
8. The method of any of claims 1-7, wherein the quality data includes data (166) indicative of observed defects in produced objects.
9. The method of any of claims 1-8, wherein the object features include regions of curvature (204).
10. The method of any of claims 1-9, wherein the process conditions include temperature (134), tension (136), roller type (138), compaction force (139), or any combination thereof.
11. A system (102) to aid in design for manufacturing an object (110), the system comprising: a memory (114) configured to store instructions (116); and a processor (112) configured to receive first data (122) representing a design (120) of the object to be manufactured and second data (124) representing a machine-learning model (126), to execute the instructions to generate third data (128) using the first data and the second data, wherein the third data indicates at least one of a modification (130) to the design of the object or process conditions (132) for production of the object, and to send the design of the object, the process conditions, or both, to a manufacturing tool (104) to enable production of the object, wherein the machine-learning model is representative of production data (168) and based at least partially on one or more of: object features (176), process parameters (178), environmental factors (180), and quality data (182).
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the production of the object includes an automated fiber placement (AFP) process (142) and the modification includes adjusting at least one of an object geometry (202) or a ply angle (210).
13. The system of claims 11 to 12, wherein the process parameters include at least one of temperature (146), pressure (148), tension (150), or roller type (152), and wherein the environmental factors include at least one of ambient temperature (162) or humidity (164).
14. The system of any of claims 11 to 13, wherein the quality data includes data (166) indicative of observed defects in produced objects, and wherein the object features include regions of curvature (204).
15. The system of any of claims 11 to 14, wherein the process conditions include temperature (134), tension (136), roller type (138), or compaction force (139).
