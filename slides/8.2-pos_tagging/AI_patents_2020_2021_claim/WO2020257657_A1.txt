SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR IMPLEMENTING A SPONSOR PORTAL FOR MEDIATING SERVICES TO END USERS
</title>

<abstract>
A graphical user interface (GUI) for a sponsor portal system includes a first display area that persistently displays a list of a plurality of tabs and a second display area. When the GUI is executed by a computing device of a sponsor of the plurality of sponsors, the second display area is dynamically updatable to display a scrollable list of customers of the sponsor, a list of vendors approved by the sponsor, and a list of active offers. In response to selection of an active offer, the GUI is configured to display a draft offer message and an approval control. In response to selection of the approval control, the sponsor engine is configured to transmit an interactive graphic to mobile computing devices, the interactive graphic configured to communicate information to the mobile computing devices for display on a screen of limited size.
