<title>
NEURAL NETWORK SYSTEM WHOSE TRAINING IS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF MODEL AND FLIGHT INFORMATION FOR ESTIMATION OF AIRCRAFT AIR DATA
</title>

<abstract>
Aircraft air data is estimated using a neural network trained to be independent of any signals from air data sensors whose values are based on air flow pressure measurements.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of generating estimated air data comprising: on board an aircraft, using sensors to sense parameters other than air data based on air flow pressure measurements; and with at least one processor, operating a trained neural network on board the aircraft to estimate air data in response to said sensed parameters other than air data based on air flow pressure measurements.
2. The method of claim 1 further including training the neural network on sensor data other than air data.
3. The method of claim 1 further including filtering the air data estimated by the neural network by a Low-pass, Kalman or Complementary filter.
4. The method of claim 1 further including preprocessing the sensed parameters before applying them as inputs to the neural network.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the sensed parameters include the group consisting essentially of W, GS, H, Gamma, Thrust, Theta, Nx, Ny, Nz, and Delta Temperature or TAT.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein the sensed parameters include some or all of H-Stab, Elev, CG, Ice, Phi, TAT, Q, P and R.
7. The method of claim 1 further including merging the neural network airspeed estimation with at least one inertial measurement using a Kalman or Complementary filter.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein the sensed parameters are independent of air flow pressure measurements.
9. The method of claim 1 further including detecting failure of air data and in response to detected failure, using an air data-dependent value captured before the failure and holding the said value or updating it with sensor parameters other than air data, and inputting the updated value to the neural network.
10. A system for generating estimated air data comprising: at least one sensor on board an aircraft, the sensor being configured to sense a parameter other than air data; and at least one processor on board the aircraft, the processor being operatively coupled to receive the sensed parameter, the processor operating a trained neural network to estimate air data in response to said sensed parameter.
11. The system of claim 10 wherein the processor is configured to perform Low Pass, Kalman or Complementary filtering on the estimated air data before providing it to a flight computer and/or a display.
12. The system of claim 10 wherein the processor is configured to detect failure of air data, and to use the sensed parameter other than air data to update an air data dependent value captured before the air data failure.
13. The system of claim 10 wherein the estimated air data comprises airspeed.
14. The system of claim 10 wherein the estimated air data comprises Mach number.
15. The system of claim 11 wherein the estimated air data comprises angle of attack.
16. The system of claim 10 wherein the estimated air data comprises angle of sideslip.
17. The system of claim 10 wherein the estimated air data comprises dynamic pressure.
18. A method of training a neural network comprising: inputting to a neural network training data comprising model data and/or flight test data, the training data including at least some parameters that are independent of air data; and training the neural network so it can estimate air data based solely on the parameters that are independent of air data in the event that air data failure occurs.
19. The method of claim 18 wherein the neural network is trained to estimate aircraft air data independent of any signals from air data sensors whose values are based on airflow pressure measurements.
