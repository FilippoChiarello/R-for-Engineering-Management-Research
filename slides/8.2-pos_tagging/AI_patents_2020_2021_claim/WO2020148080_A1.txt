IMAGE ANALYSIS METHOD AND DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
An image analysis method and device is for detecting failure or error in an image segmentation procedure. The method comprises comparing (14) segmentation outcomes for two or more images, representative of a particular anatomical region at different respective time points, and identifying a degree of consistency or deviation between them. Based on this derived consistency or deviation measure, a measure of accuracy of the segmentation procedure is determined (16).

<claims>
1. An image analysis method (10) for determining failures in an image segmentation procedure, where the segmentation procedure is for identifying and segmenting one or more anatomical features in an image, and the method comprising:
obtaining (12) image segmentations of two or more images of an anatomical region of a patient, representative of the region at different respective time points, and each segmented using said segmentation procedure;
comparing (14) the image segmentations, and deriving one or more measures of consistency between the different segmentations; and
determining (16) a measure of accuracy of the segmentation procedure based on the one or more consistency measures.
2. A method (10) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the comparing (14) the image segmentations and/or the deriving the one or more measures of consistency comprises comparing one or more similar segmented features, segmented in each of the image segmentations, and deriving one or more measures of consistency between the features in the different segmentations.
3. A method (10) as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the measure of accuracy is determined based on applying one or more pre-determined minimum thresholds for the consistency measure(s).
4. A method (10) as claimed in any of claims 1-3, wherein the measure of accuracy is determined based on the one or more derived measures of consistency and on reference to a pre-determined normal degree of inconsistency between the image
segmentations for images captured at said different time points.
5. A method (10) as claimed in any of claims 1-4, wherein the deriving the one or more measures of consistency and/or the deriving the measure of accuracy comprises use of a machine learning algorithm.
6. A method (10) as claimed in claim 5, wherein the machine learning algorithm is trained for distinguishing between normal and abnormal levels of inconsistency between image segmentations of the anatomical region representative of the region at said different time points.
7. A method (10) as claimed in any of claims 1-6, wherein said measure of accuracy comprises a probabilistic measure of accuracy.
8. A method (10) as claimed in any of claims 2-7, wherein determining the one or more measures of consistency comprises comparison of a position, shape, and/or dimensions of at least a portion of an outline of each of the segmented features.
9. A method (10) as claimed in any of claims 1-8, wherein the different time points correspond to defined time points in a periodic or cyclic movement pattern of the imaged anatomical region.
10. A method (10) as claimed in any of claims 1-9, wherein the method is performed in real time with obtaining of said image segmentations.
11. A method (10) as claimed in any of claims 1-10, wherein the method is an ultrasound image analysis method.
12. A method (10) as claimed in any of claims 1-11, wherein the obtaining of the one or more image segmentations comprises receiving one or more images and processing the images with the segmentation procedure.
13. A method (10) as claimed in any of claims 1-11, wherein the obtaining the one or more image segmentations comprises receiving ultrasound data, processing the data to derive a set of two or more images, representative of the anatomical region at different respective time points, and processing the derived one or more images with the segmentation procedure.
14. An image analysis device (30) for determining failures in an image segmentation procedure, where the segmentation procedure is for identifying and segmenting one or more anatomical features in an image, the device comprising:
an acquisition module (32) configured to obtain image segmentations of two or more images of an anatomical region of a patient, representative of the region at different time points, and each segmented using said segmentation procedure;
a comparison module (34) configured to compare the image segmentations, and to derive a measure of consistency between the different segmentations; and
an analysis module (36) configured to determine a measure of accuracy of the segmentation procedure based on the one or more consistency measures.
15. An ultrasound system (40), comprising:
an ultrasound transducer unit (38); and
an image analysis device (30) as claimed in claim 14, operatively coupled with the ultrasound transducer unit for use in obtaining said two or more image segmentations.
