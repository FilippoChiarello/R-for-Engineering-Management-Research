Server, electronic device, and electronic device information providing method
</title>

<abstract>
Various examples of the present invention provide a server for providing information of an electronic device, and the server can comprise: a communication unit for receiving, from at least one first electronic device, at least one piece of information of the first electronic device; and a control unit for determining, from the received information, a current state among a plurality of states preset for the first electronic device, and controlling the first electronic device such that state prediction information of the first electronic device is transmitted to a second electronic device if the determined current state satisfies a preset notification condition on a state diagram in which a relationship among the plurality of states is set. Additionally, other examples could be possible besides the various examples of the present invention.

<claims>
1. A server for providing information of an electronic device, the server comprising: a communicator configured to receive at least one information of at least one first electronic device from the at least one first electronic device; and a controller configured to determine, from the received information, a current state among a plurality of states that are preset for the first electronic device and to transmit state expectation information of the first electronic device to a second electronic device if the determined current state satisfies a preset notification condition on a state diagram in which relationships between the plurality of states are set, wherein the state expectation information indicates at least one state to which the first electronic device is expected to transition from the current state according to the state diagram.
2. The server of claim 1, wherein a preset state transition condition is set between at least two states among the plurality of states on the state diagram.
3. The server of claim 1, wherein the state expectation information transmitted to the second electronic device comprises information about the at least one state and time information about an expected time required for the first electronic device to make transition from the current state to the at least one state.
4. The server of claim 3, wherein the state expectation information transmitted to the second electronic device comprises information related to prevention corresponding to abnormality information expected in the first electronic device.
5. The server of claim 1, wherein the state expectation information transmitted to the second electronic device comprises at least one of information related to battery discharging, information related to sound output, information related to light out, information related to a navigator, and information related to transition to a power saving mode.
6. The server of claim 1, wherein the setting of the relationships between the plurality of states is performed by analyzing a life cycle corresponding to a use pattern of a user from the information received from the at least one first electronic device.
7. The server of claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to control the first electronic device to output the state expectation information to be transmitted to the second electronic device.
8. A method for providing information of an electronic device at a server, the method comprising: receiving at least one information of at least one first electronic device from the at least one first electronic device; determining, from the received information, a current state among a plurality of states that are preset for the first electronic device; and transmitting state expectation information of the first electronic device to a second electronic device if the determined current state satisfies a preset notification condition on a state diagram in which relationships between the plurality of states are set, wherein the state expectation information indicates at least one state to which the first electronic device is expected to transition from the current state according to the state diagram.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein a preset state transition condition is set between at least two states among the plurality of states on the state diagram.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the state expectation information transmitted to the second electronic device comprises information about the at least one state and time information about an expected time required for the first electronic device to make transition to the at least one state.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the state expectation information transmitted to the second electronic device comprises information related to prevention corresponding to abnormality information expected in the first electronic device.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the state expectation information transmitted to the second electronic device comprises at least one of information related to battery discharging, information related to sound output, information related to light out, information related to a navigator, and information related to transition to a power saving mode.
13. The method of claim 8, wherein the setting of the relationships between the plurality of states is performed by analyzing a life cycle corresponding to a use pattern of a user from the information received from the at least one first electronic device.
14. The method of claim 8, further comprising outputting, by the first electronic device, the state expectation information of the first electronic device.
