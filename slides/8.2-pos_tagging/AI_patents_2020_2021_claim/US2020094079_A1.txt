<title>
NEUROMODULATION TECHNIQUES
</title>

<abstract>
The subject matter of the present disclosure generally relates to techniques for following a treatment protocol having one or more treatment parameters to cause a targeted physiological outcome at a distal site, assessing an expression level of a gene in a region of interest after completing the treatment protocol, and modifying the one or more treatment parameters based on the expression level of the gene. The treatment protocol may include one or more ultrasound energy treatments to the region of interest.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: following a treatment protocol having one or more treatment parameters, to cause a change in concentration of one or more molecules of interest at a distal site, the treatment protocol comprising one or more ultrasound energy treatments to a region of interest; assessing an expression level of a gene in the region of interest and the concentration of the one or more molecules of interest at the distal site after completing the treatment protocol; and modifying the one or more treatment parameters based on the expression level of the gene, the concentration of the one or more molecules of interest, or both.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more treatment parameters comprises an application frequency of the ultrasound energy treatments, a duration of the ultrasound energy treatments, a duration of a recovery period between ultrasound energy treatments, or a combination thereof.
3. The method of claim 1, additionally comprising assessing a baseline expression level of the gene before following the treatment protocol, and wherein the expression level of the gene is assessed relative to the baseline expression level of the gene.
4. The method of claim 1, additionally comprising following a modified treatment protocol having one or more modified treatment parameters, the modified treatment protocol comprising one or more modified ultrasound energy treatments to the region of interest.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein following the treatment protocol causes the change in concentration of the one or more molecules of interest at the distal site and induces a change in the expression level of the gene in the region of interest.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein assessing an expression level of the gene comprises assessing the expression level of the gene from RNA transcriptome data, mRNA transcriptome data, a cluster analysis of the RNA transcriptome data or the mRNA transcriptome data, or a combination thereof.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the region of interest comprises a portion of a liver.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the region of interest comprises a portion of a spleen.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the region of interest comprises a portion of a pancreas.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the region of interest comprises a portion of a peripheral nerve ganglion.
11. A method, comprising: following a treatment protocol having one or more treatment parameters, to cause a targeted physiological outcome at a distal site, the treatment protocol comprising one or more ultrasound energy treatments to a region of interest; assessing an expression level of a gene in the region of interest after completing the treatment protocol; and modifying the one or more treatment parameters based on the expression level of the gene.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the one or more treatment parameters comprise an application frequency of the ultrasound energy treatments, a treatment duration of the ultrasound energy treatments, a recovery period between two or more subsets of the series of ultrasound energy treatments, or a combination thereof.
13. The method of claim 11, additionally comprising following a modified treatment protocol having one or more modified treatment parameters, the modified treatment protocol comprising one or more modified ultrasound energy treatments to the region of interest.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein following the treatment protocol causes the targeted physiological outcome at the distal site without inducing a change to the expression level of the gene in the region of interest.
15. The method of claim 11, wherein the targeted physiological outcome comprises a change in concentration of an enzyme responsible for synthesis or secretion of circulating vasorelaxant molecules, circulating vasoconstricting molecules, or both, and wherein the gene comprises a gene associated with the enzyme.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the targeted physiological outcome comprises a change in blood pressure and the circulating vasorelaxant molecules comprises acetylcholine.
17. A method, comprising: following a treatment protocol having one or more treatment parameters, to cause a change in concentration of one or more molecules of interest at a distal site, the treatment protocol comprising one or more ultrasound energy treatments to a region of interest; assessing RNA transcription of a gene in the region of interest; and modifying the one or more treatment parameters based on the RNA transcription of the gene in the region of interest.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein assessing the RNA transcription of a gene in the region of interest comprises sequencing RNA from blood cells extracted from the region of interest.
