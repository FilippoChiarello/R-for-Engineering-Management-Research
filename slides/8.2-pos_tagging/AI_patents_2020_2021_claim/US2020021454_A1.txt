DETECTING RECOMMISSIONING
</title>

<abstract>
Method of detecting a change in a lighting system comprising a plurality of devices each comprising a luminaire and/or a sensor, wherein each respective one of the devices has a respective location recorded in a commissioning database in association with data reported by the respective device; the method comprising: identifying a subset of said devices located within a predetermined spatial demarcation; automatically monitoring a respective value of a characteristic of each of the devices in said subset, thereby forming a data cluster comprising the values of said characteristic for the subset; automatically detecting that one of one of the devices in the subset has been moved by detecting a shift in one of the cluster values relative to the rest of the values in the data cluster; and in response to said detection, automatically outputting an indication that the commissioning database is likely to require updating to reflect said change.

<claims>
1. A method of automatically detecting a change in a lighting system comprising a plurality of devices each comprising a luminaire and/or a sensor, wherein each respective one of the devices has a respective location recorded in a commissioning database in a cloud or back end server in association with lighting, data reported by the respective device to the cloud or back end server, wherein the lighting data includes a value of a characteristic of the respective device: the method comprising: identifying a subset of said devices located within a predetermined spatial demarcation; automatically monitoring the respective value of the characteristic of each of the devices in said subset as reported by each of the devices to the cloud or back end server, thereby forming a data cluster comprising the values of said characteristic for the devices in the subset; automatically detecting that one of one of the devices in the subset has been changed by detecting a shift in one of the values relative to the rest of the values in the data cluster; and in response to said detection, automatically outputting an indication that the commissioning database is likely to require updating to reflect said change.
2. The method of claim 1, where the change includes a movement of the one or more of the devices.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the detecting of said shift comprises evaluating a metric combining the values of the data duster, and detecting a shift in said metric.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein said metric comprises a centroid of the duster values.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein said characteristic comprises a property of a wireless signal received by a wireless node from each of the devices in said subset, the values being respective measurements of said property of the received signal.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein said property comprises received signal strength and/or time-of-flight and/or angle-of arrival.
7. The method of claim 3, wherein said wireless node is another of the devices located within said spatial demarcation.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein said characteristic comprises a parameter measuring a degree of usage of each device.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein said parameter comprises an energy consumption of the device or wherein each of the devices in the subset comprises a luminaire and said parameter comprises a number of burning hours of the luminaire.
10. The method of claim 4, wherein each of the devices in said subset comprises a sensor and said characteristic comprises a sensor reading sensed by each sensor,
11. The method of claim 10, wherein each of the sensors in said subset comprises a light sensor and the sensor reading comprises a light level reading.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein each of the sensors in said subset comprises a presence sensor and the sensor reading comprises a presence sensing result.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein said characteristic comprises a control setting applied by a user to each device.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein each of the devices in said subset comprises an illumination source and said setting comprises a dim level of each illumination source.
15. Apparatus for automatically detecting a change in a lighting system comprising a plurality of devices each comprising a luminaire and/or a sensor, wherein each respective one of the devices has a respective location recorded in a commissioning database in a server in association with lighting data reported by the respective device to the cloud or back end server; the apparatus comprising one or more processing units arranged to retrieve and run code from computer-readable storage comprising one or more memory devices, the code being configured so as when run on the one or more processing units to perform operations of: for a subset of said devices located within a predetermined spatial demarcation, automatically monitoring the respective value of the characteristic of each of the devices in said subset as reported by the each of the devices to the cloud or back end server, thereby forming a data cluster comprising the values of said characteristic for the devices in the subset; automatically detecting a change in the lighting system by detecting a shift in one of the values relative to the rest of the values in the data cluster; and in response to said detection, automatically outputting an indication that the commissioning database is likely to require updating to reflect said change.
