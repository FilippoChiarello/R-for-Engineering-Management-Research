DYNAMIC ADJUSTMENT OF GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACES IN RESPONSE TO LEARNED USER PREFERENCES
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments provide for the dynamic adjustment of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in response to learned user preferences via generating a plurality of scores for a plurality of action plans based on logical structures defined by a plurality of diagnosis paradigms that identify conditions addressable by individual action; determining a plurality of weights associated with the plurality of diagnosis paradigms, wherein a given weight of the plurality of weights is based on a historic frequency of selection of individual action plans from a GUI associated with a particular diagnosis paradigm; determining a concordance measure for each action plan relative to each other action plan based on a machine learning clustering of the action plans using the plurality of weights and the plurality of scores; and generating the GUI to present the plurality of diagnosis paradigms and the plurality of action plans based on a respective concordance measure for each action plan.

<claims>
The claims are as follows:
1. A method comprising: generating a plurality of scores for a plurality of candidate action plans based on logical structures defined by a plurality of diagnosis paradigms that identify conditions addressable by individual candidate action plans of the plurality of candidate action plans; determining a plurality of weights associated with the plurality of diagnosis paradigms, wherein a given weight of the plurality of weights is based on a historic frequency of selection of the individual candidate action plans from a Graphical User Interface (GUI) associated with a particular diagnosis paradigm, wherein a given candidate action plan is displayed via a plurality of instances in the GUI in association with at least two diagnosis paradigms so that, in response to receiving a selection of the given candidate action plan and determining that a selected instance of the plurality of instances is associated with a given diagnosis paradigm of the at least two diagnosis paradigms, selection of the given candidate action plan is treated as being associated only with the given diagnosis paradigm; determining a concordance measure for each one of the plurality of candidate action plans relative to each other one of the plurality of candidate action plans based on a machine learning clustering of the plurality of candidate action plans using the plurality of weights and the plurality of scores; and generating the GUI to present the plurality of diagnosis paradigms and the plurality of candidate action plans based on a respective concordance measure for each one of the candidate action plans.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: in response to determining that a given concordance measure for the given candidate action plan selected in the GUI is below a predefined threshold, displaying a request to confirm the selection in the GUI.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein each one of the plurality of candidate action plans is displayed in the GUI via visual indicators, wherein the visual indicators for those candidate action plans associated with a concordance score that satisfies a concordance threshold differ in color or size from the visual indicators for other candidate action plans displayed in the GUI that do not satisfy the concordance threshold.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining a difference between a first score and a second score of the plurality of scores for the given candidate action plan, wherein the first score and the second score are generated based on a first diagnosis paradigm and a second diagnosis paradigm respectively; in response to the difference between the first score and the second score exceeding an anomaly threshold, determining that the given candidate action plan is anomalous; and modifying the GUI to emphasize the given candidate action plan as anomalous.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining an aggregate score for the given candidate action plan based on the plurality of scores; determining a difference between a first score generated based on a particular paradigm and the aggregate score; and in response to determining that the difference exceeds an anomaly threshold, modifying the GUI to emphasize the given candidate action plan as anomalous.
6. (canceled)
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the historic frequency of selection is based on selections received from one of: a current individual user; a selected individual user; and a predefined cohort of users.
8. A system comprising: a processor; and a memory storage device, including instructions that when performed by the processor cause the processor to: generate a plurality of scores for a plurality of candidate action plans based on logical structures defined by a plurality of diagnosis paradigms that identify conditions addressable by individual candidate action plans of the plurality of candidate action plans; determine a plurality of weights associated with the plurality of diagnosis paradigms, wherein a given weight of the plurality of weights is based on a historic frequency of selection of individual candidate action plans from a Graphical User Interface (GUI) associated with a particular diagnosis paradigm, wherein a given candidate action plan is displayed via a plurality of instances in the GUI in association with at least two diagnosis paradigms so that, in response to receiving a selection of the given candidate action plan and determining that a selected instance of the plurality of instances is associated with a given diagnosis paradigm of the at least two diagnosis paradigms, selection of the given candidate action plan is treated as being associated only with the given diagnosis paradigm; determine a concordance measure for each one of the plurality of candidate action plans relative to each other one of the plurality of candidate action plans based on a machine learning clustering of the plurality of candidate action plans using the plurality of weights and the plurality of scores; and generate the GUI to present the plurality of diagnosis paradigms and the plurality of candidate action plans based on a respective concordance measure for each one of the candidate action plans.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the instructions when performed by the processor further cause the processor to: in response to determining that a given concordance measure for the given candidate action plan selected in the GUI is below a predefined threshold, display a request to confirm the selection in the GUI.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein each one of the plurality of candidate action plans is displayed in the GUI via visual indicators, wherein the visual indicators for those candidate action plans associated with a concordance score that satisfies a concordance threshold differ in color or size from the visual indicators for other candidate action plans displayed in the GUI that do not satisfy the concordance threshold.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to: determine a difference between a first score and a second score of the plurality of scores for the given candidate action plan, wherein the first score and the second score are generated based on a first diagnosis paradigm and a second diagnosis paradigm respectively; in response to the difference between the first score and the second score exceeding an anomaly threshold, determine that the given candidate action plan is anomalous; and modify the GUI to emphasize the given candidate action plan as anomalous.
12. The system of claim 8, the instructions further cause the processor to: determine an aggregate score for the given candidate action plan based on the plurality of scores; determine a difference between a first score generated based on a particular paradigm and the aggregate score; and in response to determining that the difference exceeds an anomaly threshold, modify the GUI to emphasize the given candidate action plan as anomalous.
13. (canceled)
14. The system of claim 8, wherein the historic frequency of selection is based on selections received from one of: a current individual user; a selected individual user; and a predefined cohort of users.
15. A computer readable storage device including instructions that when performed by a processor cause the processor to perform an operation, the operation comprising: generating a plurality of scores for a plurality of candidate action plans based on logical structures defined by a plurality of diagnosis paradigms that identify conditions addressable by individual candidate action plans of the plurality of candidate action plans; determining a plurality of weights associated with the plurality of diagnosis paradigms, wherein a given weight of the plurality of weights is based on a historic frequency of selection of individual candidate action plans from a Graphical User Interface (GUI) associated with a particular diagnosis paradigm, wherein a given candidate action plan is displayed via a plurality of instances in the GUI in association with at least two diagnosis paradigms so that, in response to receiving a selection of the given candidate action plan and determining that a selected instance of the plurality of instances is associated with a given diagnosis paradigm of the at least two diagnosis paradigms, selection of the given candidate action plan is treated as being associated only with the given diagnosis paradigm; determining a concordance measure for each one of the plurality of candidate action plans relative to each other one of the plurality of candidate action plans based on a machine learning clustering of the plurality of candidate action plans using the plurality of weights and the plurality of scores; and generating the GUI to present the plurality of diagnosis paradigms and the plurality of candidate action plans based on a respective concordance measure for each one of the candidate action plans.
