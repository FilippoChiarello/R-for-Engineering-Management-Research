<title>
ENTERPRISE NETWORK THREAT DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
In a threat management platform, a number of endpoints log events in an event data recorder. A local agent filters this data and feeds a filtered data stream to a central threat management facility. The central threat management facility can locally or globally tune filtering by local agents based on the current data stream, and can query local event data recorders for additional information where necessary or helpful in threat detection or forensic analysis. The central threat management facility also stores and deploys a number of security tools such as a web-based user interface supported by machine learning models to identify potential threats requiring human intervention and other models to provide human-readable context for evaluating potential threats.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: an enterprise network; an endpoint coupled to the enterprise network, the endpoint having a data recorder that stores an event stream of event data for computing objects, a filter for creating a filtered event stream with a subset of event data from the event stream, and a query interface for receiving queries to the data recorder from a remote resource, the endpoint further including a local security agent configured to detect malware on the endpoint based on event data stored by the data recorder, and further configured to communicate the filtered event stream over the enterprise network; and a threat management facility coupled in a communicating relationship with the endpoint and a plurality of other endpoints through the enterprise network, the threat management facility configured to receive the filtered event stream from the endpoint, detect malware on the endpoint based on the filtered event stream, and remediate the endpoint when malware is detected, the threat management facility further configured to modify security functions within the enterprise network based on a security state of the endpoint.
2. The system of claim 1 wherein the threat management facility is configured to adjust reporting of event data through the filter in response to a change in the filtered event stream received from the endpoint.
3. The system of claim 2 wherein the threat management facility is configured to adjust reporting of event data through the filter when the filtered event stream indicates a compromised security state of the endpoint.
4. The system of claim 1 wherein the threat management facility is configured to adjust reporting of event data from one or more other endpoints in response to a change in the filtered event stream received from the endpoint.
5. The system of claim 1 wherein the threat management facility is configured to adjust reporting of event data through the filter when the filtered event stream indicates a compromised security state of the endpoint.
6. The system of claim 1 wherein the threat management facility is configured to request additional data from the data recorder when the filtered event stream indicates a compromised security state of the endpoint.
7. The system of claim 1 wherein the threat management facility is configured to request additional data from the data recorder when a security agent of the endpoint reports a security compromise independently from the filtered event stream.
8. The system of claim 1 wherein the data recorder records one or more events from a kernel driver.
9. The system of claim 1 wherein the data recorder records at least one change to a registry of system settings for the endpoint.
10. The system of claim 1 wherein the threat management facility is configured to adjust handling of network traffic at a gateway to the enterprise network in response to a predetermined change in the filtered event stream.
11. The system of claim 10 wherein the threat management facility includes a machine learning model for identifying potentially malicious activity on the endpoint based on the filtered event stream.
12. The system of claim 1 wherein the endpoint includes a server.
13. The system of claim 1 wherein the endpoint includes a firewall for the enterprise network.
14. The system of claim 1 wherein the endpoint includes a gateway for the enterprise network.
15. The system of claim 1 wherein the endpoint is coupled to the enterprise network through a virtual private network.
16. The system of claim 1 wherein the endpoint is coupled to the enterprise network through a wireless network.
17. The system of claim 1 wherein the threat management facility is configured to detect potentially malicious activity based on a plurality of filtered event streams from a plurality of endpoints.
18. The system of claim 1 wherein the endpoint is configured to periodically transmit a snapshot of aggregated, unfiltered data from the data recorder to the threat management facility for remote storage.
19. The system of claim 18 wherein the data recorder is configured to delete records in the data recorder corresponding to the snapshot in order to free memory for additional recording.
20. The system of claim 1 wherein the threat management facility is configured to detect malware on the endpoint based on the filtered event stream and additional context for the endpoint.
