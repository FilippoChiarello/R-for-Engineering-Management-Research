<title>
USER-CENTRIC BROWSER LOCATION
</title>

<abstract>
This disclosure provides a system and method for providing intelligently-selected collections of user-centric content in a web browser. When implemented as a method, the method includes maintaining a user-centric graph with a plurality of user-centric facts derived from user interaction with different computer services. The method further includes recognizing different contexts of interest to the user. For each context, a collection of user-centric facts pertaining to the context are recognized in the user-centric graph, such recognition being based on a relationship between user-centric facts in the user-centric graph. The method further includes, for each context, displaying intelligently-selected content based on the collection of user-centric facts.

<claims>
1. A method for providing intelligently-selected collections of user-centric content in a browser, comprising:
maintaining a user-centric graph including a plurality of user-centric facts derived from interaction, by a user, with a plurality of different computer services;
recognizing a plurality of different contexts of interest to the user; and
for each context, (1) recognizing a collection of user-centric facts pertaining to the context from the user-centric graph, such recognition being based on a relationship between user-centric facts in the user-centric graph, and (2) displaying intelligently-selected content in the browser based on the collection of user-centric facts.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of different computer services includes a computer service other than the browser.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein for at least one of the plurality of contexts, the intelligently-selected content includes assistive information to facilitate completion of a task related to the context by the user.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein at least one of the plurality of contexts is based on a predefined topic, and wherein the collection of user-centric facts for that context includes user-centric facts pertaining to the predefined topic.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein at least one of the plurality of contexts is based on a project of the user, and wherein the collection of user-centric facts for that context includes one or more of 1) emails related to the project; 2) calendar data related to the project; and 3) documents related to the project.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein for at least one of the plurality of contexts, the collection of user-centric facts includes one or more of 1) a browser history item, 2) a browser favorite, and 3) a web site.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising, for at least one of the plurality of contexts, recognizing one or more sub-collections for the context, and for each sub collection, displaying intelligently-selected content for the sub-collection based on a sub-set of the collection of user-centric facts for the context.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein for at least one of the plurality of contexts, the collection of user-centric facts is based on a temporal relationship between user-centric facts in the user-centric graph.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein for at least one of the plurality of contexts, the context is a recent activity context and wherein the collection of user-centric facts for the context includes user-centric facts derived from interaction between the user and plurality of different computer services wherein such interaction occurred after a predefined recency date.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein for at least one of the plurality of contexts, the context is a schedule tracking context and wherein the collection of user-centric facts for the context includes user-centric facts pertaining to an upcoming responsibility of the user.
11. A user-centric graph server computer system, comprising:
a logic subsystem; and
a storage subsystem configured to hold instructions executable by the logic subsystem to, in connection with operation of a browser by a user:
maintain a user-centric graph including a plurality of user-centric facts derived from interaction, by the user, with a plurality of different computer services;
recognize a plurality of different contexts of interest to the user; and for each context, (1) recognize a collection of user-centric facts pertaining to the context from the user-centric graph, such recognition being based on a relationship between user-centric facts in the user-centric graph, and (2) based on the collection of user-centric facts, intelligently select content for presentation to the user via the browser.
12. The user-centric graph server computer system of claim 11, wherein the plurality of different computer services includes a computer service other than the browser.
13. The user-centric graph server computer system of claim 11, wherein for at least one of the plurality of contexts, the intelligently-selected content includes assistive information to facilitate completion of a task related to the context by the user.
14. The user-centric graph server computer system of claim 11, wherein at least one of the plurality of contexts is based on a predefined topic, and wherein the collection of user-centric facts for that context includes user-centric facts pertaining to the predefined topic.
15. The user-centric graph server computer system of claim 11, wherein at least one of the plurality of contexts is based on a project of the user, and wherein the collection of user-centric facts for that context includes one or more of 1) emails related to the project; 2) calendar data related to the project; and 3) documents related to the project.
