<title>
Identification and localization of anomalous crop health patterns
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for generating a map identifying the size and location of anomalous crop health patterns of a geographic area. Predictive crop health forecasting based historical crop health images generates expected crop health images. Statistical parametric mapping is used to model differences in the expected crop health images and current crop health images to generate a statistical parametric map. Regions of anomalous crop health based on the modeled differences are identified in the statistical parametric map. The number of the identified anomalous crop health regions and the size of each of the identified anomalous crop health regions are determined. The statistical significance of the size and number of the anomalous crop health regions relative to the expected crop health is quantified. A map of anomalous crop health patterns delineates the anomalous crop health regions and the statistical significance of the size and number of anomalous crop health regions.
