<abstract>
In one embodiment, a method includes generating a query based on a seed product offer that describes a product being offered for sale and executing the query, using a search engine that normalizes search terms in the query, on a plurality of product offers to determine candidate offers. The candidate offers are likely associated with the product. The method further includes determining one or more common attribute values across corresponding attributes of the candidate offers. The method additionally includes for each attribute value of each candidate offer, scoring the attribute value based on whether it matches one or more of the common attribute values, and updating a set of normalized attribute values for the product to include the attribute value based on whether the score is greater than a predetermined threshold.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: by one or more processors, generating a query based on a seed product offer that describes a product being offered for sale, wherein the seed product offer is retrieved from a webpage that includes an incomplete list of attribute vales for the seed product offer by converting the webpage to a hierarchical tree data structure comprising content elements of the webpage and extracting the attribute values from the hierarchical tree data structure, wherein the incomplete list of attribute values is missing a universal product code attribute value, and wherein the query is generated based on the incomplete list of attribute list of attribute values, and wherein generating the query includes: determining one or more distinguishing terms in a title attribute value of the seed product offer that are likely to identify matching product across vendors; selecting other attribute values of the seed product offer to include in the query based on a scaled propensity of each corresponding attribute to identify matching products; and including the one or more distinguishing terms and the selected other attribute values in the query; by the one or more processor, executing the query, using a search engine, on a plurality of product offers to determine candidate offers based on a likelihood that each product offer the plurality of product offers is associated with the product; by the one or more processors, determining one or more common attribute values across each corresponding attribute of the candidate offers; by the one or more processors, determining a common attribute value score based on a number of times each common attribute value occurs between corresponding attributes of the candidate offers; by the one or more processors, for each attribute value of each candidate offer: scoring the attribute value based on whether it matches one or more of the common attribute values by multiplying the common attribute value score for a matching attribute value by a match score that assesses how closely the attribute value matches the matching attribute value; and determining a complete list of normalized attribute values for the product, including the universal product code attribute value, based on whether the score for the attribute value is greater than a predetermined threshold; by the one or more processors, storing the complete list of normalized attribute values for the product in a product catalog listing for the product; and by the one or more processors, crawling a new webpage to identify additional candidate offers for the product based on the complete list of normalized attribute values for the product retrieved from the product catalog listing for the product.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining a number of discrete attribute values associated with each of the plurality of product offers; and selecting a product offer associated with a greatest number of discrete attribute values as the seed product offer.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein executing the query on the plurality of product offers comprises iteratively executing the query until a number of the candidate offers returned from the query is less than a predetermined threshold, wherein the query is modified after each iteration to return fewer results.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein modifying the query comprises including an additional attribute of the seed product offer in the query.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the one or more common attribute values comprises determining whether two or more attribute values are synonyms.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the one or more common attribute values comprises determining that one or more attribute values refer to a secondary product related to the product being offered for sale.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: for each of the plurality of product offers, determining whether the product offer describes the product being offered for sale based on whether each attribute value of the product offer matches one or more of the normalized attribute values.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising associating each of the plurality of product offers that are determined to describe the product being offered for sale with the product catalog listing for the product.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving information indicative of a new product offer; and determining whether the new product offer describes the product being offered for sale based on whether each attribute value of the new product offer matches one or more of the normalized attribute values.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the normalized attribute values comprise: one or more nouns describing the product; a brand name associated with the product; and one or more description terms associated with the product.
11. The method claim 1, wherein the normalized attribute values comprise: one or more manufacturer's part numbers; one or more universal product codes; and a model name for the product.
12. One or more computer-readable non-transitory storage media embodying software that is operable when executed to: generate a query based on a seed product offer that describes a product being offered for sale, where the seed product offer is retrieved from a webpage that includes an incomplete list of attribute values for the seed product offer by converting the webpage to a hierarchical tree data structure comprising content elements of the webpage and extracting the attribute values from the hierarchical tree data structure, wherein the incomplete list of attribute values is missing a universal product code attribute value, and wherein the query is generated based on the incomplete list of attribute values, and wherein generating the query includes: determining one or more distinguishing terms in a title attribute value of the seed product offer that are likely to identify matching products across vendors; selecting other attribute values of the seed product offer to include in the query based on a scaled propensity of each corresponding attribute to identify matching products; and including the one or more distinguishing terms and the selected other attribute values in the query; execute the query, using a search engine, on a plurality of product offers to determine candidate offers based on a likelihood that each product offer of the plurality of product offers is associated with the product; determine one or more common attribute values across each corresponding attribute of the candidate offers; determine a common attribute value score based on a number of times each common attribute value occurs between corresponding attributes of the candidate offer; for each attribute value of each candidate offer: score the attribute value based on whether it matches one or more of the common attribute values by multiplying the common attribute value score for a matching attribute value by a match score that assesses how closely the attribute value matches the matching attribute value; and determine a complete list of normalized attribute values for the product, including the universal product code attribute value, based on whether the score for the attribute value is greater than a predetermined threshold; store the complete list of normalized attribute values for the product in a product catalog listing for the product; and crawl a new webpage to identify additional candidate offers for the product based on the complete list of normalized attribute values for the product retrieved from the product catalog listing for the product.
13. The computer-readable media of claim 12, wherein the software is further operable when executed to: determine a number of discrete attribute values associated with each of the plurality of product offers; and select a product offer associated with a greatest number of discrete attribute values as the seed product offer.
