INTELLIGENT ENDPOINT SYSTEMS FOR MANAGING EXTREME DATA
</title>

<abstract>
A system and methods are provided that can make distributed and autonomous decision science based recommendations, decisions, and actions that increasingly become smarter and faster over time. The system can comprise intelligent computing devices and components (i.e., Intelligent Endpoint Systems) at the edge or endpoints of the network (e.g., user devices or IoT devices). Each of these Intelligent Endpoint Systems can optionally have the ability to transmit and receive new data or decision science, software, data, and metadata to other intelligent devices and third party components and devices so that data or decision science, whether real-time or near real-time, batch, or manual processing, can be updated and data or decision science driven queries, recommendations and autonomous actions can be broadcasted to other Intelligent Endpoint Systems and third party systems in real-time or near real-time.
