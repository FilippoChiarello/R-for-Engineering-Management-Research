</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided for generating a first trained machine learning model, the first machine learning model comprising a plurality of hard layers for learning correlations between listing features and a plurality of soft layers, each soft layer for learning correlations for a prespecified listing feature. The systems and methods further provide for analyzing, using the first trained machine learning model, each of a plurality of price changes and price independent listing features for the first listing to determine a predicted value for each of a prespecified price dependent listing feature for each of the plurality of price changes for the first listing and generating, using the first trained machine learning model, the predicted value for each of the prespecified price dependent listing features for each of the plurality of price changes for the first listing.
