CLASSIFICATION APPARATUS, CLASSIFICATION METHOD, AND CLASSIFICATION PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
A classification apparatus includes: a crawler unit that acquires access result data for a website, the access result data including website application information, web server information, and the like that are updated by an administrator of the website; an update history generation unit that generates an update history of the website by making comparison in chronological order between pieces of information included in the access result data for the website; a classifier generation unit that generates a classifier that classifies a website having a possibility of being abused in the future, by using, as a feature value, the update history of the website; and a classification unit that classifies, through the classifier generated, the website having the possibility of being abused in the future.

<claims>
1. A classification apparatus, comprising: a memory; and a processor coupled to the memory and programmed to execute a process comprising: acquiring access result data for websites updated by administrators of the websites, the access result data including information on the websites; first generating update histories of the websites by making comparison between sets of access result data for the websites in chronological order; and second generating a classifier that classifies a website having a possibility of being abused in the future by using feature values that are the update histories of the websites.
2. The classification apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the access result data for the websites include access result data for websites that have not been abused and pre-abuse access result data for websites that have been abused, wherein the first generating executes processing of generating update histories of the websites that have not been abused by making comparison in chronological order between sets of access result data for the websites that have not been abused and processing of generating update histories of the websites that have been abused by making comparison in chronological order between sets of access result data before abuse for the websites that have been abused, and wherein the second generating generates the classifier that classifies the websites having the possibility of being abused in the future, by using features values of the update histories of the websites that have not been abused and feature values of the update histories of the websites that have been abused.
3. The classification apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the access result data for the websites include at least one of: web server information on the websites acquired from HTTP header information on the websites; web application information on the websites acquired from HTTP bodies; and CMS information indicating whether or not content management systems (CMSs) of the websites are able to be identified from each of pieces of information that are URLs of the websites, HTTP header information, and the web application information.
4. The classification apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the web server information is information indicating at least one of: web server software used in the websites; and programming languages used in the websites.
5. The classification apparatus according to claim 1, wherein when making the comparison between the sets of access result data for the websites in chronological order, the first generating includes, in the update histories of the websites, differences between access dates and times for the websites indicated by the compared sets of access result data.
6. The classification apparatus according to claim 1, the process further comprising: classifying websites having a possibility of being abused in the future by using: update histories of access result data for websites to be classified; and the classifier.
7. A classification method, including: a step of acquiring, at a classification apparatus that classifies websites having a possibility of being abused in the future, access result data for a website updated by an administrator of the website, the access result data including information on the website; a step of generating, at the classification apparatus, an update history of the website by making comparison in chronological order between sets of access result data for the website; and a step of generating, at the classification apparatus, a classifier that classifies a website having a possibility of being abused in the future, by using, as a feature value, the update history of the website.
8. A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium having stored therein classification program for classifying a website having a possibility of being abused in the future, the classification program causing a computer to execute a process comprising: acquiring access result data for a website that is updated by an administrator of the website, the access result data including information on the website; generating an update history of the website by making comparison in chronological order between sets of access result data for the website; and generating a classifier that classifies a website having a possibility of being abused in the future, by using, as a feature value, the update history of the website.
