Steganographic camera communication

<abstract>
Identifiers or references to supplemental information or content regarding images may be steganographically encoded into the images. The identifiers or references may be encoded into least significant bits or less significant bits of pixels within the image that may be selected on any basis. The identifiers or references may include alphanumeric characters, bar codes, symbols or other features. When an image is captured of an image having one or more identifiers or references steganographically encoded therein, the identifiers or references may be interpreted, and the supplemental information or content may be accessed and displayed on a computer display. In some embodiments, the supplemental information or content may identify and relate to a commercial product expressed in an image, and may include a link to one or more pages or functions for purchasing the commercial product.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: identifying an image of at least a portion of a scene by at least one computer processor; extracting information regarding at least one of an edge, a contour, an outline, a color, a texture, a silhouette or a shape within the image of at least the portion of the scene by the at least one computer processor; determining that the at least one of the edge, the contour, the outline, the color, the texture, the silhouette or the shape corresponds to an object by the at least one computer processor; identifying content relating to at least one of the scene or the object by the at least one computer processor, wherein the content relating to at least one of the scene or the object is maintained in at least one data store; generating a link to the content relating to at least one of the scene or the object by the at least one computer processor; modifying the image by the at least one computer processor, wherein modifying the image comprises steganographically encoding the link into a portion of the image; and storing the modified image in at least one data store.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein modifying the image further comprises: determining a location of the at least one of the edge, the contour, the outline, the color, the texture, the silhouette or the shape within the image by the at least one computer processor, wherein the portion of the image is the location of the at least one of the edge, the contour, the outline, the color, the texture, the silhouette or the shape within the image; and determining a pattern associated with the link by the at least one computer processor; and selecting a plurality of representative pixels in the portion of the image corresponding to the pattern associated with the link by the at least one computer processor, wherein the link is steganographically encoded into the plurality of representative pixels.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, wherein steganographically encoding the link into the portion of the image comprises: identifying a plurality of bits of at least some of the representative pixels in the portion of the image corresponding to the pattern associated with the link by the at least one computer processor; and steganographically modifying the plurality of bits to generate a visual contrast within the portion of the image, wherein the visual contrast is not visible to a human eye.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein identifying the content relating to at least one of the scene or the object comprises: determining that the object is a commercial product by the at least one computer processor based at least in part on the at least one of the edge, the contour, the outline, the color, the texture, the silhouette or the shape, wherein the content relating to at least one of the scene or the object is at least one network page offering the commercial product for sale.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein identifying the image of at least the portion of the scene comprises: capturing the image of at least the portion of the scene by at least one imaging device, wherein the portion of the scene is within a field of view of the at least one imaging device; and wherein the method further comprises: causing a display of the modified image on at least one display device over a network.
6. A server comprising: at least one computer processor; and at least one data store having at least one or more instructions stored thereon, wherein the server, upon executing the one or more instructions, is configured to at least: identify a series of image frames maintained in the at least one data store; extract information regarding at least one of an edge, a contour, an outline, a color, a texture, a silhouette or a shape depicted within at least the subset of the series of image frames; determine that the at least one of the edge, the contour, the outline, the color, the texture, the silhouette or the shape depicted within at least the subset of the series of image frames depicts at least one item in at least a portion of a scene; identify content relating to the at least one item; generate at least one link to at least a portion of the content; steganographically embed the at least one link into portions of each of the image frames of the subset depicting the at least one of the edge, the contour, the outline, the color, the texture, the silhouette or the shape; store a video file comprising the series of image frames in the at least one data store, wherein the video file comprises the subset of the series of image frames having the at least one link steganographically embedded therein; transmit, over at least one computer network, the video file to a first device comprising at least a first display; receive, over the at least one computer network, a request for at least the portion of the content from a second device comprising at least one camera, wherein the request comprises the link; and transmit, over the at least one computer network, at least some of the content to the second device.
7. The server of claim 6, wherein the server, upon executing the one or more instructions, is further configured to at least: determine a pattern associated with the at least one link; select a plurality of representative pixels in each of the subset of the series of image frames corresponding to the pattern; identify a plurality of bits of at least some of the plurality of representative pixels in each of the subset of the series of image frames corresponding to the pattern; and modify the plurality of bits in each of the subset of the series of image frames to generate a visual contrast that is not visible to the human eye.
8. The server of claim 6, wherein the link is one of: a uniform resource locator of at least one network site having the content; a bar code having the uniform resource locator of the at least one network site encoded therein; or a plurality of characters comprising at least some of the content.
