DRILLING CONTROL
</title>

<abstract>
A method can include receiving sensor data during drilling of a portion of a borehole in a geologic environment; determining a drilling mode from a plurality of drilling modes using a trained neural network and at least a portion of the sensor data; and issuing a control instruction for drilling an additional portion of the borehole using the determined drilling mode.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method comprising:
receiving sensor data during drilling of a portion of a borehole in a geologic environment;
determining a drilling mode from a plurality of drilling modes using a trained neural network and at least a portion of the sensor data; and
issuing a control instruction for drilling an additional portion of the borehole using the determined drilling mode.
2. The method of claim 1 , wherein the plurality of drilling modes comprises a rotary drilling mode.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the plurality of drilling modes comprises a sliding drilling mode.
4. The method of claim 1 , wherein the plurality of drilling modes comprises a sliding up drilling mode and a sliding down drilling mode.
5. The method of claim 1 , comprising determining a toolface orientation from a plurality of toolface orientations using the trained neural network and at least a portion of the sensor data.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein issuing the control instruction comprises issuing an instruction for using the determined toolface orientation.
7. The method of claim 1 , comprising determining a tool survey interval from a plurality of tool survey intervals using the trained neural network and at least a portion of the sensor data.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein issuing the control instruction comprises issuing an instruction for using the determined tool survey interval.
9. The method of claim 1 , wherein the control instruction for drilling the additional portion of the borehole corresponds to drilling a length of pipe.
10. The method of claim 1 , comprising drilling the additional portion of the borehole.
11. The method of claim 1 , comprising issuing an application programming interface call using at least a portion of the sensor data and receiving the drilling mode in response to the application programming interface call.
12. The method of claim 1 , wherein the determining the drilling mode comprises defining a coordinate system for a portion of a drillstring using at least a portion of the sensor data.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the sensor data comprise an inclination of the portion of the drillstring and wherein the coordinate system comprises an axial direction defined using the inclination.
14. The method of claim 12, wherein the coordinate system is a two-dimensional coordinate system and wherein the plurality of drilling modes comprises a sliding up drilling mode, a sliding down drilling mode and a rotary drilling mode.
15. The method of claim 12, wherein the coordinate system is a three-dimensional coordinate system and wherein the plurality of drilling modes comprises a sliding drilling mode and a rotary drilling mode and further comprising determining a toolface orientation using the trained neural network and at least a portion of the sensor data.
16. The method of claim 1 , wherein the receiving the sensor data during drilling of the portion of the borehole in the geologic environment comprises performing a survey using sensors of a drillstring that is utilized to perform the drilling wherein the sensors acquire the sensor data.
17. The method of claim 16, further comprising determining a survey interval using the trained neural network and at least a portion of the sensor data and performing a subsequent survey according to the determined survey interval using the sensors of the drillstring.
18. The method of claim 1 , comprising receiving a planned trajectory for the borehole wherein the determining the drilling mode is based at least in part on the planned trajectory.
19. A system comprising:
a processor;
memory accessible to the processor;
processor-executable instructions stored in the memory and executable by the processor to instruct the system to:
receive sensor data during drilling of a portion of a borehole in a geologic environment;
determine a drilling mode from a plurality of drilling modes using a trained neural network and at least a portion of the sensor data; and
issue a control instruction for drilling an additional portion of the borehole using the determined drilling mode.
20. One or more computer-readable storage media comprising computer-executable instructions executable to instruct a computing system to:
receive sensor data during drilling of a portion of a borehole in a geologic environment;
determine a drilling mode from a plurality of drilling modes using a trained neural network and at least a portion of the sensor data; and
issue a control instruction for drilling an additional portion of the borehole using the determined drilling mode.
