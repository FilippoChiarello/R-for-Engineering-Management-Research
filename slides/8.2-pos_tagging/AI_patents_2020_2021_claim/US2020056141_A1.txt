Charged Particle Beam Apparatus and Cell Evaluation Method
</title>

<abstract>
Provided is a charged particle beam apparatus capable of more objectively and highly accurately calculating a feature of a cell from an observation image of a cell and evaluating a cell. The charged particle beam apparatus includes an image acquisition unit 18 that acquires an image of a cell, a contour extraction unit 19 that extracts a contour of the image, a feature calculation unit 20 that calculates a morphological feature of the contour based on the contour and calculates the feature of an internal structure such as a cytoplasm contained in an internal area of the contour, and a determination unit 21 that determines quality and/or functionality of the cell based on the feature, and can objectively and highly accurately evaluate the quality and/or the functionality of the cell included in the captured image.
