<claims>
1. A manufacturing system comprising: a manufacturing execution system (MES) configured to manage each of a series of manufacturing steps based on a target value; a sensor coupled to a jig; an electric motor configured to drive the jig to manufacture a product in at least two steps; an inverter that controls the electric motor; and a lower system connected to the MES and the inverter, wherein the MES provides, to the lower system, a lower target value that is information in response to driving details of the electric motor to achieve the target value of a step of the series of manufacturing steps based on step result information related to the step, wherein the lower system provides, to the inverter, driving target information that is information that has the same content as the lower target value, wherein the inverter obtains the step result information related to the step and identifies a command value that is information of driving details of the electric motor to achieve the driving target according to the target value of the step based on the step result information to drive the electric motor.
2. The manufacturing system according to claim 1, wherein the manufacturing execution system (MES) manages each of the series of manufacturing steps based on the target value of a final step among the series of manufacturing steps and provides target values of each step based on at least the step result information, which indicates at least a measured value of a characteristic measured by the sensor of a product to be manufactured related to each respective step of the series of manufacturing steps to the lower system, wherein the inverter obtains, in each step, predetermined information related to another step other than the step, and determines the command value according to the target value of the step based on each predetermined information of the step and the other step.
3. The manufacturing system according to claim 2, wherein the inverter is configured to: obtain a target value of a step other than a current step, and determines the command value according to the target value of the step based on the obtained target value of the other step, the received information indicating the measured value and the received driving target information.
4. The manufacturing system according to claim 2, wherein the inverter is configured to: obtain, in a final step of the series of steps, a target value of the final step from the MES and determine the command value according to the target value of the final step based on the received information indicating the measured value, the received driving target information and the obtained target value of the final step.
5. The manufacturing system according to claim 1, wherein the inverter is configured to: train, using machine learning, an engine that learns a corresponding pattern between the received driving target information and the received information indicating the measured value to a characteristic to be achieved for the product to be manufactured and a control parameter of the electric motor, and determine a command value of the electric motor based on the trained engine.
6. The manufacturing system according to claim 1, wherein the characteristic is one of quality information, the quality information indicating one or more selected from the group consisting of hardness, smoothness, shape, temperature, humidity, and agitation degree of the product to be manufactured.
7. A manufacturing method comprising: providing, by a manufacturing execution system (MES), to a lower system, a lower target value that is information in response to driving details of an electric motor to achieve the target value of a step of the series of manufacturing steps based on step result information related to the step, providing, by the lower system, to the inverter, driving target information that is information that has the same content as the lower target value, obtaining, by the inverter, the step result information related to the step and identifying a command value that is information of driving details of the electric motor to achieve the driving target according to the target value of the step based on the step result information to drive the electric motor.
