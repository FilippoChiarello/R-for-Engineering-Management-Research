INTEGRATED BATTERY MONITORING CIRCUIT
</title>

<abstract>
A system for dealing with rechargeable batteries, including a computerized server, a monitoring circuit installed in a rechargeable battery and configured to periodically sample the status of the rechargeable battery and communicate the sampled information to the server, wherein the server analyzes the sampled information from the monitoring circuits of one or more rechargeable batteries and provides instructions for dealing with each rechargeable battery to a communication device of an administrator in charge of dealing with each rechargeable battery.

<claims>
I/We claim:
1. A system for monitoring rechargeable batteries, comprising:
a computerized server;
a monitoring circuits installed in a rechargeable battery and configured to periodically sample the status of the rechargeable battery and communicate the sampled information to the server;
wherein the server analyzes the sampled information from the monitoring circuits of one or more rechargeable batteries and provides instructions for dealing with each rechargeable battery to a communication device of an administrator in charge of dealing with each rechargeable battery.
2. The system according to claim 1, wherein the monitoring circuit comprises a voltage sensor, a current sensor and a resistance sensor.
3. The system according to claim 1, wherein the monitoring circuit comprises a global positioning system chip.
4. The system according to claim 1, wherein the monitoring circuit comprises a temperature sensor.
5. The system according to claim 1 , wherein the monitoring circuit periodically communicates the status information to the server at a lower frequency than sampling the status.
6. The system according to claim 1, wherein the monitoring circuit includes a storage mode of operation in which the monitoring circuit tests the rechargeable battery to determine if the rechargeable battery has been connected to a consumer device to be charged and provide power, and does not communicate with the server.
7. The system according to claim 6, wherein the monitoring circuit automatically changes from the storage mode to a consumer mode that periodically samples the status of the rechargeable battery, when the monitoring circuit identifies that the rechargeable battery started to receive charge or started to provide charge at the inputs or outputs of the rechargeable battery.
8. The system according to claim 1, wherein the status of the rechargeable battery includes measurement of internal resistance and internal charge.
9. The system according to claim 1 , wherein the server builds a statistical model from the sampled status of multiple monitoring circuits, to recommend maintenance of the battery based on the sampled status of the rechargeable battery.
10. The system according to claim 1, wherein the server trains a neural network from the sampled status of multiple monitoring circuits, to recommend maintenance of the rechargeable battery based on the sampled status of the battery.
11. A method of monitoring rechargeable batteries, comprising:
periodically sampling the status of a rechargeable battery by a monitoring circuit installed in the rechargeable battery;
communicating the sampled information to a computerized server;
analyzing the sampled information from the monitoring circuits of one or more rechargeable batteries at the server; and providing instructions for dealing with each rechargeable battery to a communication device of an administrator in charge of dealing with each rechargeable battery.
12, The method according to claim 11, wherein the monitoring circuit comprises a voltage sensor, a current sensor and a resistance sensor.
13. The method according to claim 11, wherein the monitoring circuit comprises a global positioning System chip.
14. The method according to claim 11, wherein the monitoring circuit comprises a temperature sensor.
15. The method according to claim 11 , wherein the monitoring circuit periodically communicates the status information to the server at a lower frequency than sampling the status.
16. The method according to claim 11, wherein the monitoring circuit includes a storage mode of operation in which the monitoring circuit tests the rechargeable battery to determine if the rechargeable battery has been connected to a consumer device to be charged and provide power, and does not communicate with the server.
17, The method according to claim 16, wherein the monitoring circuit automatically changes from the storage mode to a consumer mode that periodically samples the status of the rechargeable battery, when the monitoring circuit identifies that the rechargeable battery started to receive charge or started to provide charge at the inputs or outputs of the rechargeable battery.
18. The method according to claim 1 1, wherein the status of the rechargeable battery includes measurement of internal resistance and internal charge.
19. The method according to claim 11, wherein the server builds a statistical model from the sampled status of multiple monitoring circuits, to recommend maintenance of the battery based on the sampled status of the rechargeable battery.
20. The method according to claim 11 , wherein the server trains a neural network from the sampled status of multiple monitoring circuits, to recommend maintenance of the rechargeable battery based on the sampled status of the battery.
