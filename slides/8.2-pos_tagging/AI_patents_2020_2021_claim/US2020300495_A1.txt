PREDICTION METHOD, MODEL LEARNING METHOD, AND NON-TRANSITORY COMPUTER-READABLE STORAGE MEDIUM FOR STORING PREDICTION PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
A prediction method implemented by a computer, the method includes: receiving a classification model from a server, the classification model being a model for classifying logs of an electronic device into two or more classes, the server being a computer configured to distribute the classification model; calculating, with respect to different time points, a prediction error by using a predicted value outputted by the classification model and an actual measured value observed at each of the different time points; performing sequential machine learning for the classification model to have the prediction error satisfy a certain condition; and when a cumulative sum with respect to the prediction error of the sequential machine learning is equal to or greater than a threshold, requesting the server apparatus to relearn the classification model.

2. The prediction method according to claim 1, further comprising: inputting, to the classification model for predicting details of operation performed by a user to control an air conditioning device, a temperature of a space targeted by the air conditioning device for control and an outside-air temperature both measured at a prediction target time in accordance with a temperature of the space and an outside-air temperature; obtaining, as the predicted value outputted by the classification model, information indicating an operation for increasing a set temperature of the air conditioning device, an operation for decreasing the set temperature, or an operation for maintaining the set temperature; and controlling the air conditioning device in accordance with the obtained predicted value.
3. The prediction method according to claim 2, wherein the performing of the sequential machine learning for the classification model includes updating a weight included in the classification model in accordance with an online gradient descent method by using the predicted value and the actual measured value when the prediction error occurs because the predicted value and the actual measured value are different from each other and also includes stopping the sequential machine learning for the classification model when the prediction error does not occur because the predicted value and the actual measured value are identical to each other.
4. The prediction method according to claim 1, wherein the calculating includes calculating the prediction error in accordance with a cross entropy error calculated by using the predicted value and the actual measured value, and the requesting includes requesting relearning the classification model when a cumulative sum with respect to the cross entropy error is equal to or greater than a threshold.

A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium for storing a prediction program which causes a processor to perform processing, the processing comprising: receiving a classification model from a server, the classification model being a model for classifying logs of an electronic device into two or more classes, the server being a computer configured to distribute the classification model; calculating, with respect to different time points, a prediction error by using a predicted value outputted by the classification model and an actual measured value observed at each of the different time points; performing sequential machine learning for the classification model to have the prediction error satisfy a certain condition; and when a cumulative sum with respect to the prediction error of the sequential machine learning is equal to or greater than a threshold, requesting the server apparatus to relearn the classification model.
6. A model learning method implemented by a computer, comprising: collecting logs of electronic devices installed individually in spaces of different environments; learn a classification model for performing classification into two or more classes by using learning data generated from the logs of the electronic devices; distributing the learned classification model to particular devices installed in the spaces; relearning the classification model in response to a request from any of the particular devices; and redistributing the relearned classification model to the particular devices.
