ENHANCED ENSEMBLE MODEL DIVERSITY AND LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments for implementing enhanced ensemble model diversity and learning by a processor. One or more data sets may be created by combining one or more clusters of data points of a minority class with selected data points of a majority class. One or more ensemble models may be created from the one or more data sets using a supervised machine learning operation. An occurrence of an event may be predicted using the one or more ensemble models.

<claims>
1. A method for implementing enhanced ensemble model diversity and learning in a computing environment by a processor, comprising:
creating one or more data sets by combining one or more clusters of data points of a minority class with selected data points of a majority class;
creating one or more ensemble models from the one or more data sets using a supervised machine learning operation; and
predicting an occurrence of an event using the one or more ensemble models.
2. The method of claim 1 , further including determining a score for a test data point by combining one or more predictions from the one or more ensemble models.
3. The method of claim 1 , further including:
extracting one or more features from a plurality of data points;
classifying those of the plurality of data points into the majority class or the minority class according to the one or more features.
4. The method of claim 1, further including:
clustering a plurality of minority class data points into a K number of clusters, wherein the K number of clusters form the minority class; and
augmenting each of the K number of clusters the minority class with a random number of the selected data points of the majority class.
5. The method of claim 1 , further including detecting one or more sub-classes of the minority class.
6. The method of claim 1 , further including partitioning the minority class into the one or more clusters of data points using the supervised machine learning operation.
7. The method of claim 1, further including labeling the one or more clusters of data points of the minority class according to predefined criteria.
8. A system for implementing enhanced ensemble model diversity and learning in a computing environment, comprising:
one or more computers with executable instructions that when executed cause the system to:
create one or more data sets by combining one or more clusters of data points of a minority class with selected data points of a majority class; create one or more ensemble models from the one or more data sets using a supervised machine learning operation; and
predict an occurrence of an event using the one or more ensemble models.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions determine a score for a test data point by combining one or more predictions from the one or more ensemble models.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions:
extract one or more features from a plurality of data points;
classify those of the plurality of data points into the majority class or the minority class according to the one or more features.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions:
cluster a plurality of minority class data points into a K number of clusters, wherein the K number of clusters form the minority class; and
augment each of the K number of clusters the minority class with a random number of the selected data points of the majority class.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions detect one or more sub-classes of the minority class.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions partition the minority class into the one or more clusters of data points using the supervised machine learning operation.
14. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions label the one or more clusters of data points of the minority class according to predefined criteria.
15. A computer program product for implementing enhanced ensemble model diversity and learning by a processor, the computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable program code portions stored therein, the computer-readable program code portions comprising:
an executable portion that creates one or more data sets by combining one or more clusters of data points of a minority class with selected data points of a majority class;
an executable portion that creates one or more ensemble models from the one or more data sets using a supervised machine learning operation; and
an executable portion that predicts an occurrence of an event using the one or more ensemble models.
16. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that determines a score for a test data point by combining one or more predictions from the one or more ensemble models.
17. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that:
extracts one or more features from a plurality of data points;
classifies those of the plurality of data points into the majority class or the minority class according to the one or more features.
18. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that:
clusters a plurality of minority class data points into a K number of clusters, wherein the K number of clusters form the minority class; and
augments each of the K number of clusters the minority class with a random number of the selected data points of the majority class.
19. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that:
detect one or more sub-classes of the minority class; or
label the one or more clusters of data points of the minority class according to predefined criteria.
20. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that partitions the minority class into the one or more clusters of data points using the supervised machine learning operation.
