METHOD FOR REGULATING POSITION OF OBJECT
</title>

<abstract>
A method for regulating a position of an object includes detecting a plurality of first alignment structures of the object under rotation of the object, wherein a plurality of second alignment structures of the object sequentially face a photosensitive element during the rotation of the object, and when the plurality of first alignment structures have reached a first predetermined state, stopping the rotation of the object and performing an image capturing procedure of the object. The image capturing procedure includes: capturing a test image of the object, wherein the test image includes an image block presenting the second alignment structure currently facing the photosensitive element; detecting the position of the image block in the test image; when the image block is located in the middle of the test image, capturing a detection image of the object.
