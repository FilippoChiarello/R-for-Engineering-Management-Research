IMAGE DISPLAY APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
An image display apparatus according to an embodiment of the present technology includes a light source section, a first sensor, a second sensor, and a light source control section. The light source section emits emitted light. The first sensor is arranged in a first region and is capable of detecting a state of the emitted light. The second sensor is arranged in a second region and is capable of detecting the state of the emitted light, the second region being less influenced by dust than the first region. The light source control section is capable of controlling the light source section according to a first detection result of detection performed by the first sensor, and a second detection result of detection performed by the second sensor.

<claims>
1. An image display apparatus comprising: a light source section that emits emitted light; a first sensor that is arranged in a first region and is capable of detecting a state of the emitted light; a second sensor that is arranged in a second region and is capable of detecting the state of the emitted light, the second region being less influenced by dust than the first region; and a light source control section that is capable of controlling the light source section according to a first detection result of detection performed by the first sensor, and a second detection result of detection performed by the second sensor.
2. The image display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the second region is a region in which an amount of dust is smaller than an amount of dust in the first region.
3. The image display apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising a housing that includes an inlet used to intake outside air, wherein the first region is provided in a flow passage of the outside air intaken from the inlet, or near the flow passage of the outside air, and the second region is provided at a position away from the flow passage of the outside air.
4. The image display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the second region is provided in a hermetically sealed space, or in a space into which entrance of the outside air is restricted.
5. The image display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the light source control section controls the light source section such that intensity of the emitted light emitted from the light source section is maintained constant.
6. The image display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the light source section includes at least one light source that is driven by being supplied with current, and according to the first detection result and the second detection result, the light source control section controls the current supplied to the at least one light source.
7. The image display apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising a storage that stores therein first reference information regarding the first sensor and second reference information regarding the second sensor, wherein the light source control section controls the light source section according to the first detection result, the second detection result, the stored first reference information, and the stored second reference information.
8. The image display apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the light source control section controls the light source section according to a correlation between the first reference information and the second reference information, and a correlation between the first detection result and the second detection result.
9. The image display apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the first reference information is a detection result detected by the first sensor when the emitted light in a reference state is emitted, and the second reference information is a detection result detected by the second sensor when the emitted light in the reference state is emitted.
10. The image display apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the light source control section corrects the first detection result according to the first detection result, the second detection result, the stored first reference information, and the stored second reference information.
11. The image display apparatus according to claim 10, wherein the light source section includes at least one light source that is driven by being supplied with current, and according to the corrected first detection result, the light source control section controls the current supplied to the at least one light source.
12. The image display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the light source section includes at least one light source that is driven by being supplied with current, and according to the second detection result, the light source control section controls the current supplied to the at least one light source.
13. The image display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the light source section includes at least one light source and a light emitter, the light emitter being excited by light emitted from the at least one light source and emitting visible light, and emits, as the emitted light, light that includes the light from the at least one light source and the visible light from the light emitter.
14. The image display apparatus according to claim 13, wherein the light source section includes a hermetically sealed portion that includes a window and has a hermetically sealed space formed inside the hermetically sealed portion, the light emitter is arranged in the hermetically sealed space, and the second sensor is arranged to face the window of the hermetically sealed portion.
15. The image display apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: an image generator that generates an image using the emitted light emitted from the light source section; and a projection section that projects the image generated by the image generator.
