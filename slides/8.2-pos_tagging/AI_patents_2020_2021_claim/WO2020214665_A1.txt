QUERYING OVER EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods, and devices for querying over an external table are disclosed. A method includes connecting a database platform to an external table such that the database platform has read access for the external table and does not have write access for the external table. The method includes receiving a query comprising a predicate, the query directed at least to data in the external table. The method includes determining, based on metadata, one or more partitions in the external table comprising data satisfying the predicate. The method includes pruning, based on the metadata, all partitions in the external table that do not comprise any data satisfying the predicate. The method includes generating a query plan comprising a plurality of discrete subtasks. The method includes assigning, based on the metadata, the plurality of discrete subtasks to one or more nodes in an execution platform.
