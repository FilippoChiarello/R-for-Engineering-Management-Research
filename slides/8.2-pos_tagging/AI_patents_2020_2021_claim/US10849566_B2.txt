<title>
Apparatus, system, method and computer program for assessing the risk of an exacerbation and/or hospitalization
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to an apparatus, a system (100), a method (200), and a computer program for assessing the risk of an exacerbation and/or hospitalization. A patient's physical activity is measured (e.g., by an accelerometer (110)) during an active period of time (e.g., during awake hours) and during a rest period of time (e.g., during sleep hours) to gather first and second activity data. A risk of exacerbation and/or hospitalization is assessed (e.g., by a risk assessment unit (120)) based on an expression involving the respective activity data during active and rest periods fulfilling a predetermined relationship with respect to a predetermined activity level. For instance, low activity data during active periods and high activity data during rest periods indicates an increased risk of exacerbation and/or hospital readmission for the patient.

<claims>
1. An apparatus for assessing the risk of an exacerbation and/or hospitalization of a subject, said apparatus comprising: a first accelerometer having a first sensitivity; a second accelerometer having a second sensitivity, different from the first sensitivity; an input unit for receiving first and second activity data for said subject from the first and second accelerometers, respectively, wherein said first activity data is indicative of said subject's physical activity during at least part of an active period of time, wherein said second activity data is indicative of said subject's physical activity during at least part of a rest period of time; and a risk assessment unit configured to detect an onset of the exacerbation based on predetermined criteria, wherein the predetermined criteria comprises the condition that an expression involving the first activity data and/or the second activity data fulfills a predetermined relationship with respect to a predetermined activity level, the apparatus being configured to determine a ratio between first activity data and second activity data, wherein the apparatus is configured to compare the ratio to a ratio activity level, wherein the predetermined criteria comprise the condition that the ratio is lower than the ratio activity level.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the first activity data corresponds to average activity data of said subject during at least part of the active period; and/or wherein the second activity data corresponds to average activity of said subject during at least part of the rest period.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the first activity data corresponds to average activity data of said subject during the entire active period; and/or wherein the second activity data corresponds to average activity of said subject during the entire rest period.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the apparatus is configured to compare the first activity data to past first activity data, wherein the past first activity data correspond to first activity data gathered on one or more previous days; and/or wherein the apparatus is configured to compare the second activity data to past second activity data, wherein the past second activity data correspond to second activity data gathered on the one or more previous days.
5. The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the predetermined criteria comprise the conditions that: (1) the first activity data is lower than one or more of the past first activities, and (2) the second activity is higher than one or more of the past second activities.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the apparatus is configured to compare the ratio to past ratios, wherein the past ratios correspond to ratios between first activity data and second activity data gathered on one or more previous days.
7. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the predetermined criteria comprise the condition that the ratio is smaller than one or more of the past ratios.
8. A system for assessing the risk of an exacerbation and/or hospitalization of a subject, the system comprising: a physical activity measurement unit; wherein the physical activity measurement unit is configured to measure said subject's physical activity during at least part of an active period of time to gather first activity data; wherein the physical activity measurement unit is further configured to measure the subject's physical activity during at least part of a rest period of time to gather second activity data; and an apparatus as defined in claim 1; wherein said input unit of said apparatus is configured to receive said first and second activity data from said physical activity measurement unit.
9. An apparatus as in claim 1, wherein the ratio activity level comprises an average activity level of a patient group.
10. An apparatus as in claim 1, wherein the apparatus is further configured to determine a stability classification for the subject based on the comparison of the ratio to the ratio activity level, and further comprising a display configured to display the determined stability classification.
