SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PRODUCING SEARCH RESULTS BASED ON USER PREFERENCES
</title>

<abstract>
Methods for producing personalized search results. The methods may include identifying a first list of search results associated with a search query from a user; identifying a search profile of the user; generating a set of characteristic features for each search result of the first list of search results, wherein each set of characteristic features describes the content of a search result in a binary form; identifying, in the first list of search results, one or more search results having characteristic features matching the characteristic features of the search profile; based on the matching, generating a second list of search results organized by the relevance of the search results with respect to the search profile; and providing the second list of search results to the user.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method of producing personalized search results comprising: identifying a first list of search results associated with a search query from a user; identifying a search profile of the user, wherein the search profile includes: an identification of a topic defined by the user; an identification of a set of documents associated with the user, wherein the set of documents contains content matching the topic defined by the user; and an identification of a set of characteristic features describing the topic in a binary form, wherein the set of characteristic features is derived from at least the content of the set of documents; generating a set of characteristic features for each search result of the first list of search results, wherein each set of characteristic features describes the content of a search result in a binary form; identifying, in the first list of search results, one or more search results having characteristic features matching the characteristic features of the search profile; based on the matching, generating a second list of search results organized by the relevance of the search results with respect to the search profile; and providing the second list of search results to the user.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the second list of search results further comprises reordering the first list of the search results based on one or more quality factors determined for each search result in the matching process according to a predetermined scheme.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of generating the second list of search results further comprises filtering the second list of search results by one or more quality factors determined for each search result in the matching process.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein filtering the second list search results further comprises selecting one or more search results having a quality factor meeting a predefined filtering criteria.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the quality factor of a search result comprises a relevance score of the search result with respect to the search profile.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein the filtering criteria comprises a threshold value for the relevance score.
7. A computer-implemented method of producing personalized search results, performed on a server system having one or more processors and memory storing one or more programs for execution by the one or more processors to perform the method, comprising: identifying a list of search results associated with a search query from a user; identifying a plurality of shared search profiles of one or more other users, wherein a shared search profile includes an identification of a set of documents collected by the user, wherein the documents belonging to a search profile have a content matching a specific topic defined by the user for the respective search profile, and wherein each search profile further includes an identification of a set of characteristic features describing a search topic in a binary form, said characteristic features of the search profile being derived from at least the content of the documents assigned to the respective search profile, generating a set of characteristic features for each search result of the returned list, said set of characteristic features describing the content of the search result in a binary form, for at least one search result, identifying one or more shared search profiles of the one or more other users, the topics of which match the content of the search results based on the characteristic features of the search results and the characteristic features of said plurality of shared search profiles; based on the matching process, generating a list of search results with recommended shared search profiles, wherein at least one shared search profile of at least one other user is associated with at least one of the search results; providing the list of search results with recommended shared search profiles to the user; and upon selecting a recommended shared search profile of another user, using the selected recommended shared search profile in a new search to obtain a personalized list of search results.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the step of identifying one or more shared search profiles for the search results comprises determining a set of quality factors for each shared search profile according to a predetermined scheme, a quality factor being indicative of the degree of matching between the topic of the shared search profile and the content of a search result.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the step of generating the list of search results comprises selecting a shared search profile for recommendation to a search result if the respective quality factor meets predefined filtering criteria.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein a quality factor of a search profile is defined as a score of relevance of the shared search profile with respect to a search result, and the filtering criteria includes a threshold value for the relevance of the shared search profile, and a shared search profile is recommended to a search result if its score of relevance exceeds said threshold value.
11. A computer-implemented method of producing personalized search results, performed on a server system having one or more processors and memory storing one or more programs for execution by the one or more processors to perform the method, comprising: identifying a search query from a user; identifying a plurality of shared search profiles of one or more other users, wherein each search profile include an identification of a set of documents collected by the user, wherein the documents belonging to a search profile have a content matching a specific topic defined by the user for the respective search profile, and wherein each search profile further includes an identification of a set of characteristic features describing a search topic in a binary form, said characteristic features of the search profile being derived from at least the content of the documents assigned to the respective search profile, generating a set of characteristic features for the search query, said set of characteristic features describing the content of the search query in a binary form, for the search query, identifying one or more shared search profiles of the one or more other users, the topics of which match the content of the search query based on the characteristic features of the search query and the characteristic features of said plurality of shared search profiles; based on the matching process, generating a list of at least one recommended shared search profile; providing the list of the at least one recommended shared search profile to the user; and upon selecting a recommended shared search profile of another user, using the selected recommended shared search profile in a new search to obtain a personalized list of search results.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the step of identifying one or more shared search profiles for the search query comprises determining a set of quality factors for the search query according to a predetermined scheme, a quality factor being indicative of the degree of matching between the topic of the shared search profile and the content of a search query.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the step of generating the list of at least one recommended shared search profile comprises selecting a shared search profile for recommendation to the search query if the respective quality factor meets predefined filtering criteria.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein a quality factor of a search profile is defined as a score of relevance of the shared search profile with respect to the search query, and the filtering criteria includes a threshold value for the relevance of the shared search profile, and a shared search profile is recommended to the search query if its score of relevance exceeds said threshold value.
