VOICE PROCESSING DEVICE AND VOICE PROCESSING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A voice processing device (1) and method includes a microphone (15), a feature amount extracting portion (121) that extracts a feature amount of an audio signal representing sound collected by the microphone (15) on a near-end side, a gain determining portion (122) that determines a gain of the audio signal based on the extracted feature amount, a signal processing portion (12) that processes the audio signal based on the determined gain of the audio signal, and a sending portion (11) that sends the processed audio signal to a far-end side.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A voice processing device (1) comprising: a microphone (15); a feature amount extracting portion (121) that extracts a feature amount of an audio signal representing sound, collected by the microphone (15) on a near-end side, including person's voice, ; a gain determining portion (122) that determines a gain of the audio signal based on the extracted feature amount a signal processing portion (12) that processes the audio signal based on the determined gain of the audio signal; and a sending portion (11) that sends the processed audio signal to a far-end side.
2. The voice processing device (1) according to claim 1, further comprising: a voice estimating portion (121) that estimates a probability value of the audio signal including person's voice, wherein the gain determining portion (122) determines the gain of the audio signal based on the estimated probability value.
3. The voice processing device (1) according to claim 2, further comprising: an audio signal-to-noise (SN) ratio calculating portion (124) that estimates an audio SN ratio in the audio signal, wherein the gain determining portion (122) determines the gain of the audio signal based on the estimated probability value and the estimated SN ratio.
4. The voice processing device (1A) according to claim 2 or 3, further comprising: a plurality of microphones (15A, 15B) including the microphone (15); a correlation value calculating portion (125) that estimates a correlation value of the audio signal representing the sound collected by the plurality of microphones (15A, 15B), wherein the gain determining portion (122) determines the gain of the audio signal representing the sound collected by the plurality of the microphones (15A, 15B) based on the estimated probability value and the estimated correlation value.
5. The voice processing device (1, 1A) according to any one of claims 2 to 4, wherein the processing portion (12) gradually reduces or instantly increases the gain of the audio signal.
6. The voice processing device (1, 1A) according to one of any claims 2 to 5, wherein the gain determining portion (122) determines the gain of the audio signal to be: a minimum in a case where the estimated probability value is less than a predetermined value; and a value greater than the minimum in a case where the estimated probability value is greater than the predetermined value.
7. The voice processing device (1, 1A) according to one of any claims 2 to 6, wherein the voice estimating portion (121) estimates the probability value using a cepstrum analysis.
8. The voice processing device (1, 1A) according to any one of claims 2 to 6, wherein the voice estimating portion (121) estimates the probability value using a machine learning method.
9. The voice processing device (1, 1A) according to any one of claims 2 to 6, wherein the voice estimating portion (121) estimates the probability value using a frequency distribution of a fundamental tone and a harmonic tone of the audio signal.
10. A voice processing method comprising: extracting a feature amount of voice of an audio signal representing sound, collected by a microphone (15) on a near-end side, including person's voice, ; determining a gain of the audio signal based on the extracted feature amount; processing the audio signal based on the determined gain of the audio signal; and sending the processed audio signal to a far-end side.
11. A voice processing method according to claim 10, further comprising: obtaining a probability value of the audio signal representing sound, collected by the microphone (15) on the near-end side, including a person's voice, wherein the determining determines a gain of the audio signal based on the determined probability value.
12. The voice processing method according to claim 11, further comprising: estimating an audio signal-to-noise (SN) ratio in the audio signal, wherein the determining determines the gain of the audio signal based on the obtained probability value and the estimated audio SN ratio.
13. The voice processing method according to claim 11 or 12, further comprising: estimating a correlation value of the audio signal representing sound collected by a plurality of microphones (15A, 15B), including the microphone (15), wherein the determining determines the gain of the audio signal representing the sound collected by the plurality of microphones (15A, 15B) based on the obtained probability value and the estimated correlation value.
14. The voice processing method according to any one of claims 11 to 13, wherein the processing gradually reduces or instantly increases the determined gain of the audio signal.
15. The voice processing method according to any one of claims 11 to 14, wherein the determining determines the gain of the audio signal to be: a minimum in a case where the probability value is less than predetermined value; and a value greater than the minimum in a case where the probability value is greater than the predetermined value.
