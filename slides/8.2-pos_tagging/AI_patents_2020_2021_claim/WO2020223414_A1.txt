LOW LATENCY WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM FOR TELEOPERATED VEHICLE ENVIRONMENTS
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle remote support system includes a communication system that operates over a plurality of parallel wireless network connections to provide low-latency video from vehicle to a remote support server that provides remote support to the vehicle dependent on real-time video. The vehicle includes a source that encodes multiple versions of the original video segments (e.g., one per wireless network connection) and transmits the multiple versions of the segments to a sink at the remote support server over the respective wireless connections. This redundant multi-path communication system rationally allocates network resources to the managed video streams and balances bandwidth against latency in order to avoid network congestion and safety issues associated with single-path transmissions. In other embodiments, a similar communication system that transmits video or other real-time messages between a source and a sink may be utilized in cloud robotics applications.
