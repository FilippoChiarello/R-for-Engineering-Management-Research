<title>
SYSTEM AND METHOD TO DETECT CHANGES IN HEALTH PARAMETERS AND ACTIVATE LIFESAVING MEASURES
</title>

<abstract>
Certain exemplary embodiments can provide an apparatus wearable by a user. The apparatus can comprise a biometric sensor constructed to generate signals based upon measurements of the user. The apparatus can comprise a processor constructed to determine a significant detrimental change in the user via an algorithm based upon the signals.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: detecting a biometric data of a user during a calibration period, the biometric data detected via a device having at least one sensor secured to the user; calibrating the device based on the biometric data to yield a calibration profile of the user; detecting new biometric data of the user via the sensor; comparing the new biometric data with the calibration profile to determine whether the user has experienced a change; and generating an alert when the user has experienced at least a detrimental change.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the calibrating of the device based on the biometric data includes comparing the biometric data to a population norm for the biometric data detected.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the calibrating of the device based on the biometric data includes determining an average of the biometric data.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the calibrating of the device includes comparing the biometric data of the user to a past medical history of the user, the past medical history input into the device via a user interface.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: instructing the user not to move for a baseline portion of the calibration period; instructing the user to perform a physical activity for an active portion of the calibration period; determining whether the user is performing the physical activity; and wherein the calibrating of the device is based on the biometric data detected during the active portion of the calibration period when it is determined that the user is performing the physical activity.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the determining of whether the user is performing the physical activity is determined via a motion sensor.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein the determining of whether the user is performing the physical activity is determined via user input into the device via a user interface.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the alert includes at least one of an audible alarm, a visual queue, a vibration, a text message, or a phone call.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the generating of the alert includes initiating a communication between the device and a third party.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the communication to the third party includes two-way audio communication with the third party.
11. The method of claim 9, further comprising: canceling the alert by making a selection on a display of the device to cancel the communication to the third party.
12. The method of claim 9, wherein the communication to the third party includes a one-way transmission to initiate emergency medical services.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the device is (i) an electrocardiogram sensor, and (ii) operable to couple to the user in at least two locations.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the device is configured to monitor a heart rate of the user.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein the device is configured to monitor blood pressure of the user.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein determining whether a change is detrimental includes (i) determining a confidence level associated with the new biometric data, and (ii) determining a deviation of the new biometric data from the calibration profile based upon the confidence level.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein the device is configured to (i) detect data from a plurality of sensors to account for disturbances or to boost data certainty, (ii) render the new biometric data from the sensor over a determined time period, and (ii) render a deviation of the new biometric data from a baseline value.
17. The method of claim 1, further comprising: processing the new biometric data, via a processor, to generate one or more processed signals; determining a confidence level based on the processed signals; and determining whether the user has experienced the detrimental change based on the confidence level.
18. The method of claim 1, wherein, the at least one sensor includes a plurality of sensors; and the device is configured to use data received from the sensors to account for disturbances and to boost data certainty.
