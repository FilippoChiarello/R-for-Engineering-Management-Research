System and Method for Image Recognition Registration of an Athlete in a Sporting Event
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for image recognition registration of an athlete into a sporting event. The athlete is registered in the sporting event using image recognition technology. A digital commencement image of the athlete taken by a camera (106) as the athlete crosses a starting line. The digital commencement image is compared with a stored profile image of the athlete to identify the athlete and enter them into the event without the need for the athlete to pre-register for the particular event. Enhanced recognition techniques incorporating pattern recognition may be used to increase identity accuracy.

<claims>
1. An image recognition system for entering an athlete in a sporting event, the system comprising: a camera configured to capture an image of the athlete commencing the sporting event; an athlete database configured to store a profile image of the athlete prior to commencement of the event; and a processor configured to compare the profile image stored in said athlete database with a commencement image of the athlete captured by said camera, said processor being configured to register the athlete to participate in the sporting event based on the comparison between the profile image and the commencement image.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein said processor is configured to enter the athlete as a participant in the sporting event without receiving an indication prior to commencement of the sporting event that the athlete will be participating in the sporting event.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein said processor is configured to enter the athlete as a participant in the sporting event without using a bib number wearable by the athlete.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein said processor is configured to enter the athlete as a participant in the sporting event without using a timing chip wearable by the athlete.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein said processor is configured to enter the athlete as a participant in the sporting event without using a RFID tag wearable by the athlete.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein said processor is configured to enter the athlete as a participant in the sporting event using solely the comparison between the profile image and the commencement image.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein said processor is configured to enter the athlete as a participant in the sporting event using one or more facial features of the athlete.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein said processor is configured to enter the athlete as a participant in the sporting event using solely facial recognition technology.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein said athlete database includes payment information associated with the athlete, said processor being configured to extract payment based on the payment information of the athlete after the athlete is entered in the sporting event.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the sporting event is a timed sporting event, said processor being configured to use the comparison of the profile image and the commencement image to start timing the athlete in the sporting event.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the sporting event has a start and a finish, said camera being positioned proximate the start, further comprising a second camera proximate the finish.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein said camera includes a wireless communications module having at least one of a Wi-Fi radio and a Bluetooth radio.
13. A method of image recognition entry of an athlete in a sporting event, comprising: capturing a digital profile image of the athlete prior to commencement of the sporting event; associating, with a processor, identification data of the athlete with the athlete's profile image; capturing a digital commencement image of the athlete as the athlete commences the sporting event; and registering the athlete to participate in the sporting event based on a comparison of the profile image and the commencement image.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the entering of the athlete as a participant in the sporting event is conducted using only image recognition technology.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein the entering of the athlete as a participant in the sporting event is conducted using only facial recognition technology.
16. The method of claim 13, wherein the entering of the athlete as a participant in the sporting event is conducted without data from a wearable timing chip.
17. The method of claim 13, wherein the entering of the athlete as a participant in the sporting event is conducted without using a RFID tag worn by the athlete.
18. The method of claim 13, wherein the sporting event is a timed event, further comprising assigning a commencement time with the athlete's commencement image.
19. The method of claim 13, further comprising charging the athlete an entry fee after entering the athlete in the sporting event.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein the entry fee is charged while the athlete is participating in the sporting event.
21. The method of claim 13, wherein the digital commencement image is captured at an angle below a horizontal plane intersecting a chin of the athlete.
22. The method of claim 13, wherein the digital commencement image is captured at an angle below a horizontal plane intersecting a waist of the athlete.
23. The method of claim 13, further comprising conducting a pre-registration check to determine if the athlete is already registered before entering the athlete based on the comparison of the profile image and commencement image.
24. The method of claim 13, further comprising using a behaviour pattern recognition to enhance identification accuracy of the athlete in the commencement image.
25. The method of claim 24, wherein the behaviour pattern recognition includes a weighting of calendar event data and event participation history data.
26. A system for entering an athlete in a sporting event, the system comprising: a means for capturing an image of the athlete commencing the sporting event; an athlete database configured to store a profile image of the athlete prior to commencement of the event; and a means for registering the athlete to participate in the sporting event based on the comparison between the profile image and the commencement image.
