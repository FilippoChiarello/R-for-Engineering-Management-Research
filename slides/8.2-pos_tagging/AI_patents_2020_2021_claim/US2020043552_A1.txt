<title>
Programmable artificial neuron and associated programming method
</title>

<abstract>
A programmable artificial neuron emitting an output signal controlled by at least one control parameter, includes, for each control parameter, a capacitor and at least one block including at least one multiplexer configured to be in two states: a programming state and an operating state; a transistor; and a non-volatile resistive random access memory connected in series with the transistor, the capacitor and the resistive random access memory being mounted in parallel. The multiplexer is configured to, when it is in the programming state, set a resistance value of the resistive random access memory to set the value of the control parameter; when it is in the operating state, conserve the set resistance value of the resistive random access memory.
