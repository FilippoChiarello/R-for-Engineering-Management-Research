<title>
DYNAMIC END-STOPS FOR ELECTRIC POWER STEERING
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosed subject matter generally relates to a method for controlling an electrically powered steering assistance system including an electric motor for providing assisting torque to an axle of a vehicle such that impact between a wheel and the wheel housing can be prevented. Electrically powered steering assist systems include an electric motor for providing an assist steering torque to the steerable wheels of the vehicle. The electrical current used by the electric motor has a typical dependence with the amount of output torque from the motor. The electrical current of the electrical current used by the electric motor exhibits distinguishable characteristics when the wheels reach the end stop in the wheel housing. By monitoring the electrical current used by the electric motor for providing the assisting torque it is possible to determine that the wheels have reached the end-stop.
