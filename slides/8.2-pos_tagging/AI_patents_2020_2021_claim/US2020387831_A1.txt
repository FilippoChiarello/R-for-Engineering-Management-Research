<claims>
1. A computer system for generating information regarding a chemical compound, comprising: one or more memories; and one or more processors configured to: generate information regarding a chemical compound based on a latent variable; and evaluate the generated information regarding the chemical compound based on desired characteristics, wherein generating the information regarding the chemical compound is restricted by the desired characteristics.
2. The computer system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the one or more processors are configured to generate the information regarding the chemical compound in response to the latent variable and a label, and the desired characteristics correspond to the label.
3. The computer system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to assign a druglikeness score to the information regarding the chemical compound.
4. The computer system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to implement an encoder and a decoder, and wherein labels and information regarding chemical compounds are fed into, and encoded by, the encoder to cause the encoder and the decoder to model a joint probability distribution with respect to the labels and the information regarding chemical compounds during a training process.
5. The computer system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the desired characteristics is a desired set of properties for the chemical compound including one or more of activity, solubility, toxicity, ease of synthesis, bioassay data, solubility, cross-reactivity, other chemical features including hydrophobicity, phase transition boundaries including freezing point, compound data on the chemical compound's biological and chemical characteristics, and any other information usable to characterize a structure or function of the chemical compound.
6. The computer system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to generate first information regarding the chemical compound and to search for second information regarding the chemical compound different from the first information regarding the chemical compound.
7. The computer system as claimed in claim 6, wherein the second information regarding the chemical compound is searched for based on an evaluation of the first information regarding the chemical compound.
8. The computer system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the chemical compound is a drug.
9. The computer system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to compare predicted results.
10. A computer system for generating information regarding a chemical compound, comprising: one or more memories; and one or more processors configured to: generate information regarding a chemical compound based on a latent variable; and assign a properness score to the generated information regarding the chemical compound, wherein generating the information regarding the chemical compound is restricted by desired characteristics.
11. A method of generating information regarding a chemical compound, the method comprising: generating information regarding a chemical compound based on a latent variable; and evaluating the generated information regarding the chemical compound based on desired characteristics, wherein generating the information regarding the chemical compound is restricted by the desired characteristics.
12. The method as claimed in claim 11, wherein said generating information regarding a chemical compound includes generating the information regarding the chemical compound in response to the latent variable and a label, and the desired characteristics correspond to the label.
13. The method as claimed in claim 11, wherein said evaluating the generated information includes assigning a druglikeness score to the information regarding the chemical compound.
14. The method as claimed in claim 11, wherein said generating information regarding a chemical compound and said evaluating the generated information are implement by an encoder and a decoder, and wherein labels and information regarding chemical compounds are fed into, and encoded by, the encoder to cause the encoder and the decoder to model a joint probability distribution with respect to the labels and the information regarding chemical compounds during a training process.
15. The method as claimed in claim 11, wherein the desired characteristics is a desired set of properties for the chemical compound including one or more of activity, solubility, toxicity, ease of synthesis, bioassay data, solubility, cross-reactivity, other chemical features including hydrophobicity, phase transition boundaries including freezing point, compound data on the chemical compound's biological and chemical characteristics, and any other information usable to characterize a structure or function of the chemical compound.
16. The method as claimed in claim 11, comprising generating first information regarding the chemical compound; and searching for second information regarding the chemical compound different from the first information regarding the chemical compound.
17. The method as claimed in claim 16, wherein the second information regarding the chemical compound is searched for based on an evaluation of the first information regarding the chemical compound.
18. The method as claimed in claim 11, wherein the chemical compound is a drug.
19. The method as claimed in claim 11, further comprising comparing predicted results.
