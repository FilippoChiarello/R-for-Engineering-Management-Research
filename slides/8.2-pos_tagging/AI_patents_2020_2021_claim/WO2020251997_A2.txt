TECHNIQUES FOR ANALYTICAL INSTRUMENT PERFORMANCE DIAGNOSTICS
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques and apparatus for diagnostic processes for analytical instruments are described. In one embodiment, for example, an apparatus may include at least one memory, and logic coupled to the at least one memory. The logic may be configured to receive diagnostic information associated with at least one analytical instrument, and process the diagnostic information using a computational model to generate at least one diagnostic model for at least one diagnostic. Other embodiments are described.
