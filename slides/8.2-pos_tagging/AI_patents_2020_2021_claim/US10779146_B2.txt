<title>
System and method for smart material monitoring
</title>

<abstract>
A system for monitoring the characteristics of a material by measuring electrical properties of a material uses a material monitoring device and a cloud database that relates electrical properties of a material to characteristics of that material. The aging and fermentation processes of wine and other alcohols can be monitored. The status and decomposition of foodstuffs can be monitored. The progress of chemical reactions in a vessel can be monitored. Water quality of water from a water conduit can be monitored. These characteristics can be indicated on a product monitoring device or can be communicated to an external computing device.

<claims>
1. A system for monitoring a characteristic of a gaseous material, the system comprising: a sensor device, the sensor device comprising an input electrode to measure at least one signal relating to an electrical property of a gaseous material; a body to house the sensor device and to maintain the sensor device in contact with the gaseous material; and an external computing device remote from the sensor device and in communication with the sensor device via a network, the external computing device configured to apply machine learning to infer a characteristic of the gaseous material based on the at least one signal relating to an electrical property of the gaseous material, the machine learning applied via a machine learning model trained with library data to recognize an inferable characteristic of the gaseous material, the library data relating previously measured signals relating to the electrical property of the gaseous material to known characteristics of the gaseous material.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising: a communication device to provide communication between the sensor device and the external computing device via the network, the communication device configured to receive measurement data corresponding to the at least one signal from the sensor device and to transmit the measurement data to the external computing device via the network, the communication device housed in the body; and a power source to power the sensor device and the communication device, the power source housed in the body.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the body is attachable to a material conduit for transporting the gaseous material, and the input electrode extends into an interior of the material conduit.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the body comprises a stopper configured to plug an opening of a vessel, the vessel defining an interior to contain a liquid and a headspace to contain a vapor of the liquid, the input electrode extending into the headspace to contact the vapor, the vapor comprising the gaseous material.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the vessel comprises a wine bottle, the liquid comprises wine, and the stopper comprises a wine bottle cork.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the external computing device comprises a database comprising library data relating one or more signals relating to electrical properties of the gaseous material to characteristics of a liquid of which the gaseous material is a vapor, the characteristics selected from a group consisting of: optimal tasting window, age, fermentation status, flavor, acidity, tannin, fruitiness, body, aroma, and chemical reaction progress.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the external computing device is further configured to contribute the at least one signal relating to an electrical property of the material and the inferred characteristic of the material to the database.
8. The system of claim 2, wherein the power source is selected from a group consisting of: a power harvesting circuit, a battery, a solar cell, and an alternating current electrical power adapter.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein one or more of the sensor device and the external computing device are configured to perform an analytical methodology selected from a group consisting of: potentiometry, coulometry, voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, square wave voltammetry, stair-case voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, alternating current voltammetry, amperometry, pulsed amperometry, galvanometry, and polarography.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the sensor device further comprises an output electrode to apply electrical stimulus to the gaseous material, and the input electrode is to measure a response to the electrical stimulus applied to the gaseous material, and wherein the at least one signal relating to an electrical property of the gaseous material comprises the response.
