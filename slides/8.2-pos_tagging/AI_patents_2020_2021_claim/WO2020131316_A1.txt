BID TOOL OPTIMIZATION
</title>

<abstract>
A method including determining a first bid for a healthcare plan and a second bid for the healthcare plan. A bid-pricing tool is configured to utilize one or more first components to determine the first bid and one or more second components to determine the second bid, respectively. A bid difference between the first bid and the second bid includes at least a monetary difference in premiums paid by members of the first bid for the healthcare plan and members of the second bid for the healthcare plan. One or more third components are determined based at least in part on the bid difference to determine a third bid for the healthcare plan. A second bid difference is determined between at least one of the first bid and the third bid or the second bid and the third bid.

<claims>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method for use in determining one or more bids, the method comprising:
determining a range of values representing a projected inflation rate of members associated with a healthcare plan;
determining a range of values representing a projected utilization rate associated with one or more services of the healthcare plan;
determining a range of projected benefits associated with the one or more services of the healthcare plan, wherein the range of projected benefits correspond to a cost-sharing structure between one or more of the one or more services of the healthcare plan;
determining the one or more bids via machine-learning techniques using a bid pricing tool, wherein the one or more bids are based at least in part on:
varying a value of a projected inflation rate within the range of values representing the projected inflation rate;
varying a value of a projected utilization rate within the range of values representing the projected utilization rate; and
varying projected benefits within the range of projected benefits associated with the one or more services of the healthcare plan;

2. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein:
the one or more bids comprises a first bid and a second bid;
the first bid is based at least in part on:
a first value of the projected inflation rate;
a first value of the projected utilization rate; and
first projected benefits; and
the second bid is based at least in part on:
a second value of the projected inflation rate that is different than the first value of the projected inflation rate; a second value of the projected utilization rate that is different than the first value of the projected utilization rate; and
second projected benefits that is different than the first projected benefits.
3. The method as recited in any of claims 1 or 2, further comprising determining one or more bid differences between the one or more bids, and wherein:
the one or more bids comprises a first bid and a second bid;
the one or more bid differences comprises a bid difference between the first bid and the second bid; and
the bid difference comprises at least one of:
an indication of a difference in profit margin between the first bid and the second bid;
an indication of a difference in a premium paid by members of the first bid and a premium paid by members of the second bid; or
an indication of a difference in a share of claims covered by the members of the first bid and the members of the second bid.
4. The method as recited in any of claims 1-3, wherein the healthcare plan is offered by a healthcare plan provider, and wherein at least one of the range of values corresponding to the projected inflation rate, the range of values corresponding to the projected utilization rate, or the range of projected benefits is determined based at least in part on at least one of:
analyzing claims under previous healthcare plans offered by the healthcare provider; or analyzing one or more third-party databases for claims of a geographical area in which the previous healthcare plans were not offered by the healthcare plan provider.
5. The method as recited in any of claims 1-4, wherein:
the one or more bids are further based at least in part on projected claims for a provider associated with at least a portion of the members associated with the healthcare plan; and the projected claims are based at least in part on at least one of:
the projected inflation rate of the members of the healthcare plan; or the projected utilization rate of the healthcare plan.
6. The method as recited in any of claims 1-5, further comprising determining one or more bid differences between the one or more bids, and wherein:
the one or more bids comprises a first bid and a second bid;
the one or more bid differences comprises a bid difference between the first bid and the second bid;
the first bid is further based at least in part on first projected claims for a provider of the healthcare plan associated with at least a portion of the members associated with the healthcare plan;
the second bid is further based at least in part on second projected claims for the provider of the healthcare plan associated with at least the portion of the members associated with the healthcare plan; and
the bid difference comprises a difference between the first projected claims and the second projected claims.
7. The method as recited in any of claims 1-6, further comprising:
determining that the first projected claims are less than a projected claims threshold; determining that the second projected claims are less than the projected claims threshold, and
wherein determining the bid difference is based at least in part on the first projected claims and the second projected claims being less than the projected claims threshold.
8. The method as recited in any of claims 1-7, further comprising determining one or more bid differences between the one or more bids, wherein the one or more bids comprises one or more first bids, wherein the one or more bid differences comprise a bid difference, the method further comprising:
determining that the bid difference is less than a threshold amount;
determining one or more second bids via the machine-learning techniques using the bid pricing tool, wherein the one or more second bids are based at least in part on two of: varying the value of the projected inflation rate within the range of values representing the projected inflation rate;
varying the value of the projected utilization rate within the range of values representing the projected utilization rate; or
varying the projected benefits within the range of projected benefits.
9. A method implemented at least in part by machine-learning techniques, the method comprising:
determining a first bid for a healthcare plan using the machine-learning techniques and based at least in part on a bid-pricing tool, wherein the bid-pricing tool is configured to utilize one or more first components to determine the first bid;
determining a second bid for the healthcare plan using the machine-learning techniques and based at least in part on the bid-pricing tool, wherein the bid-pricing tool is configured to utilize one or more second components to determine the second bid, and wherein the first bid and the second bid are determined in parallel;
determining a first bid difference between the first bid and the second bid, wherein the bid difference includes at least a monetary difference in premiums paid by members of the first bid for the healthcare plan and members of the second bid for the healthcare plan;
determining one or more third components based at least in part on the bid difference; determining a third bid for the healthcare plan using the machine-learning techniques and based at least in part on the bid-pricing tool, wherein the bid-pricing tool is configured to utilize the one or more third components to determine the third bid; and
determining a second bid difference between at least one of:
the first bid and the third bid; or
the second bid and the third bid.
10. The method as recited in claim 9, wherein:
at least one first component of the one or more first components is the same as at least one first component of the one or more second components; and
