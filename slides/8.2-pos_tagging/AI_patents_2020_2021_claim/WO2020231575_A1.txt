SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SELECTING RELEVANT CONTENT IN AN ENHANCED VIEW MODE
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the present disclosure include devices and methods for selecting relevant content in an enhanced view mode. In an example, a computer device may be configured to receive digital content to be displayed by a web-based application according to a first view mode. The computer device may be configured to determine an enhanced view mode is enabled, wherein the enhanced view mode is different from the first view mode. The computer device may be configured to identify one or more first portions of primary content of the digital content to be displayed according to the enhanced view mode based on user information. The computer device may be configured to cause display of the one or more first portions of the primary content in the web-based application according to the enhanced view mode, and one or more second portions of the primary content according to a second view mode different from the enhanced view mode.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computing device, comprising:
a memory storing instructions;
a processor communicatively coupled with the memory and configured to execute the instructions to:
receive digital content to be displayed by a web-based application according to a first view mode;
determine an enhanced view mode is enabled, wherein the enhanced view mode is different from the first view mode;
identify one or more first portions of primary content of the digital content to be displayed according to the enhanced view mode based on user information; and
cause display of the one or more first portions of the primary content in the web-based application according to the enhanced view mode, and one or more second portions of the primary content according to a second view mode different from the enhanced view mode.
2. The computing device of claim 1 , wherein the processor is further configured to execute the instructions to:
identify secondary content of the digital content; and
prevent display of the secondary content in the web-based application.
3. The computing device of claim 1 , wherein the processor is further configured to execute the instructions to:
determine an enhanced view mode parameter of the web-based application has been selected; and
determine the enhanced view mode is enabled, in response to the enhanced view mode parameter having been selected.
4. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the user information includes information on fields of interest to the user.
5. The computing device of claim 1 , wherein the processor is further configured to execute the instructions to:
receive the user information based on one or more user inputs of an input device, wherein the one or more user inputs correspond to input from one or more of a stylus, a mouse, a microphone, a camera, or a touch screen.
6. The computing device of claim 1 , wherein the processor is further configured to execute the instructions to: predict user interests based on a user profile; and
determine the user information based on the predicted user interests.
7. The computing device of claim 6, wherein the processor is further configured to execute the instructions to:
compare one or more topics of the one or more first portions of the primary content with profile information from the user profile, wherein the predicted user interests correspond to the topic of the one or more first portions of the primary content matching with the profile information.
8. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to execute the instructions to:
receive the user information based on one or more monitored user actions.
9. The computing device of claim 8, wherein the one or more monitored user actions correspond to an action from one or more of a gesture monitoring device, an electroencephalography system, an eye gaze tracking system, or an input device.
10. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the enhanced view mode includes one or more of an increased font size compared to a font size of the first view mode, or a new color of a font or a background different from a first color of the font or the background of the first view mode.
11. A method, comprising:
receiving digital content to be displayed by a web-based application according to a first view mode;
determining an enhanced view mode is enabled, wherein the enhanced view mode is different from the first view mode;
identifying one or more first portions of primary content of the digital content to be displayed according to the enhanced view mode based on user information; and
displaying the one or more first portions of the primary content in the web-based application according to the enhanced view mode, and one or more second portions of the primary content according to a second view mode different from the enhanced view mode.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising:
identifying secondary content of the digital content; and
preventing display of the secondary content in the web-based application.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the determining the enhanced view mode is enabled comprises:
determining an enhanced view mode parameter of the web-based application has been selected.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein the user information includes information on fields of interest to the user.
15. The method of claim 11, wherein the identifying the first content to be displayed according to the enhanced view mode comprises:
receiving the user information based on one or more user inputs, wherein the one or more user inputs correspond to input from one or more of a stylus, a mouse, a microphone, a camera, or a touch screen.
