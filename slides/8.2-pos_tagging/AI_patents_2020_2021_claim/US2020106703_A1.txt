<title>
Neural network for secure data transport, system and method
</title>

<abstract>
This application discloses a neural network that also functions as a secure packet data network using an MPLS-type label switching technology. The neural network uses its intelligence to build and manage label switched paths (LSPs) to securely transport user packets and solve complex mathematical problems. This architecture is well suited to interconnect large numbers of processors or computers into a secure neural network exhibiting advanced intelligence which can be used for complex activities such as managing the power grid. However, the methods taught here can be applied to other data networks including ad-hoc, mobile, Information Centric, Content Centric, Sensor, and traditional IP packet networks, cell or frame-switched networks, time-slot networks and the like.

<claims>
1. A neural network of nodes associated with grid elements of an electric power grid comprising: edge nodes of the neural network associated with power sources and power loads of the electric power grid, where the nodes contain software or circuitry to connect them with their corresponding grid elements; switch fabric nodes associated with each electrical switching point of the power grid, where the nodes contain software or circuitry to connect them with their corresponding switching points; the aforementioned nodes with software or circuitry capable of receiving or measuring losses associated with the high voltage transmission lines used to interconnect the corresponding grid elements, and to convert these losses to weights used in the neural network.
2. The nodes of the neural network of claim 1 further capable of receiving requests from associated grid elements, and transporting them across the network to selected edge nodes.
3. The nodes of the neural network of claim 2 containing software or circuitry capable of introducing a delay in data transported, where the delay functions as a weight value for the corresponding nodes of the neural network.
4. The nodes of the neural network of claim 2 where the nodes do not rely on the use of an IP address.
5. A method of interconnecting grid elements to control an electric power grid via a neural network comprising: associating and connecting each power source and power load of the power grid with edge nodes of the neural network; associating and connecting each power switching point of the power grid with a switch fabric node of the neural network; establishing a data link corresponding to each high voltage transmission line interconnecting the switching points with each other and to the sources and loads, where the loss of each line is assigned a weight for the corresponding node of the neural network.
6. The method of claim 5 where the nodes receive requests from corresponding grid elements and transport them across the grid to other grid elements.
7. The method of claim 6 where the weight function is achieved through the addition of delay in the transport of data across the neural network.
8. The method of claim 6 where neural network does not rely on the use of an IP address.
9. A method of using an Information Centric Network to establish a connection between a user and one or more interested servers comprising: receiving at a node of the Information Centric Network an information request containing a key word from a user; using the request to initiate a hunt through the network for interested servers; establishing a connection between the user and one or more interested servers based on the one or more servers accepting the information request; and transmitting information pursuant to the request from the one or more servers to the user.
10. The method of claim 9 where the Information Centric Network is a neural network.
11. The method of claim 9 where the Information Centric Network does not rely on the use of an IP address.
12. The method of claim 11 where the neural network uses time delay as a weight factor.
