MANAGING REGULATORY COMPLIANCE FOR AN ENTITY
</title>

<abstract>
Various embodiments are provided for managing regulatory compliance for an entity in a computing environment by a processor. A law, policy, regulation, or a combination thereof extracted from one or more segments of text data from one or more data sources may be identified requiring an obligation to be performed by the entity.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for managing regulatory compliance for an entity in a computing environment by a processor, comprising: identifying a law, a policy, a regulation, or a combination thereof extracted from one or more segments of text data from one or more data sources requiring an obligation to be performed by the entity.
2. The method of claim 1, further including ingesting the text data from the one or more data sources upon processing the text data using a lexical analysis, parsing, extraction of concepts, semantic analysis, a machine learning operation, or a combination thereof.
3. The method of claim 1, further including identifying a defined scope of compliance required by the law, the policy, the regulation, or a combination thereof.
4. The method of claim 1, further including using natural language processing (NLP) to determine the one or more segments with obligation content, wherein the one or more segments are sentences and the obligation content requires the obligation to conform to the law, the policy, the regulation, or a combination thereof.
5. The method of claim 1, further including: initializing a machine learning mechanism to learn, determine, or identify the obligation from the one or more segments of the text data; or generating a compliance corpus from training one or more machine learning models for managing regulatory compliance.
6. The method of claim 1, further including generating a cluster of entities identified from the one or more segments of the text data.
7. The method of claim 1, further including defining the obligation as a required action for compliance with the law, the policy, the regulation, a prohibition of conduct, behavior, or activity of the entity, a legal right, a constraint of the entity, or a combination thereof.
8. A system, for managing regulatory compliance for an entity in a computing environment, comprising: one or more processors with executable instructions that when executed cause the system to: identify a law, a policy, a regulation, or a combination thereof extracted from one or more segments of text data from one or more data sources requiring an obligation to be performed by the entity.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions further ingest the text data from the one or more data sources upon processing the text data using a lexical analysis, parsing, extraction of concepts, semantic analysis, a machine learning operation, or a combination thereof.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions further identify a defined scope of compliance required by the law, the policy, the regulation, or a combination thereof.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions further use natural language processing (NLP) to determine the one or more segments with obligation content, wherein the one or more segments are sentences and the obligation content requires the obligation to conform to the law, the policy, the regulation, or a combination thereof.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions further: initialize a machine learning mechanism to learn, determine, or identify the obligation from the one or more segments of the text data; or generate a compliance corpus from training one or more machine learning models for managing regulatory compliance.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions further generate a cluster of entities identified from the one or more segments of the text data.
14. The system of claim 8, wherein the executable instructions further define the obligation as a required action for compliance with the law, the policy, the regulation, a prohibition of conduct, behavior, or activity of the entity, a legal right, a constraint of the entity, or a combination thereof.
15. A computer program product for, by one or more processors, managing regulatory compliance for an entity in a computing environment, the computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable program code portions stored therein, the computer-readable program code portions comprising: an executable portion that identifies a law, a policy, a regulation, or a combination thereof extracted from one or more segments of text data from one or more data sources requiring an obligation to be performed by the entity.
16. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that ingests the text data from the one or more data sources upon processing the text data using a lexical analysis, parsing, extraction of concepts, semantic analysis, a machine learning operation, or a combination thereof.
17. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that identifies a defined scope of compliance required by the law, the policy, the regulation, or a combination thereof.
18. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that: uses natural language processing (NLP) to determine the one or more segments with obligation content, wherein the one or more segments are sentences and the obligation content requires the obligation to conform to the law, the policy, the regulation, or a combination thereof; initializes a machine learning mechanism to learn, determine, or identify the obligation from the one or more segments of the text data; or generates a compliance corpus from training one or more machine learning models for managing regulatory compliance.
19. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that generates a cluster of entities identified from the one or more segments of the text data.
20. The computer program product of claim 15, further including an executable portion that defines the obligation as a required action for compliance with the law, the policy, the regulation, a prohibition of conduct, behavior, or activity of the entity, a legal right, a constraint of the entity, or a combination thereof.
