TARGETING MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE IN CANCER WITH CD36 ANTAGONISTS
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to the field of tumor treatment, in particular to melanoma tumor treatment. In particular it relates to the use of CD36 antagonists for use in tumor treatment, in particular for use in reducing tumor cell heterogeneity during minimal residual disease (MRD), and thus for use in treating MRD. Even more in particular, the invention relates to the use of CD36 antagonists in combination with clinically established treatments such as treatment with a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, and optionally other anticancer agents.
