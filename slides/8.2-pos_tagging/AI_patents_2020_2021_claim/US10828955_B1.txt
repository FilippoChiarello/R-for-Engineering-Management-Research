<title>
Vehicle suspension system with remote actuation
</title>

<abstract>
A suspension system for controlling movement of a vehicle wheel may include a spring and damper assembly coupling the wheel to the vehicle chassis for movement of the wheel relative to the vehicle chassis. The spring and damper assembly may include a spring coupled to a damper member configured to extend and retract the wheel relative to the vehicle chassis. The suspension system may further include a damper actuator located remotely from the spring and damper assembly and configured to modify an amount of damping and/or wheel extension. The suspension system may also include a spring actuator integrated with the damper actuator and configured to control an amount of deflection of the spring and/or to alter a spring rate. The damper actuator may be provided at a location in the vehicle separated from the spring and damper assembly.

A vehicle comprising: a vehicle chassis; a wheel; a spring and damper assembly coupling the wheel to the vehicle chassis for movement of the wheel relative to the vehicle chassis, the spring and damper assembly comprising a spring coupled to a damper member; a damper actuator located remotely from the spring and damper assembly and coupled to the damper member; and a spring actuator coupled to the damper actuator and configured to control an amount of deflection of the spring.
2. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the damper actuator comprises a hydraulic cylinder coupled to the damper member and configured to cause the damper member to extend and retract.
3. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the spring comprises a pneumatic spring, and wherein the spring actuator is located remotely from the pneumatic spring and configured to change a volume of air in the pneumatic spring.
4. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein activation of the damper actuator causes activation of the spring actuator.
5. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the damper actuator comprises a damper actuator rod, and the spring actuator comprises a spring actuator rod coupled to the damper actuator rod.
6. The vehicle of claim 5, further comprising: a pneumatic line coupled to the spring actuator and the pneumatic spring and providing flow communication between the spring actuator and the pneumatic spring; and a hydraulic line coupled to the damper actuator and the damper member and providing flow communication between the damper actuator and the damper member.
7. An apparatus comprising: a spring and damper assembly for coupling a vehicle wheel to a vehicle chassis, the spring and damper assembly comprising a pneumatic spring coupled to a damper member configured to extend and retract; a damper actuator located remotely from the spring and damper assembly and configured to cause the damper member to extend and retract; and a spring actuator coupled to the damper actuator and configured to change a volume of air in the pneumatic spring.
8. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein the damper actuator comprises a hydraulic cylinder coupled to the damper member and configured to cause the damper member to extend and retract.
9. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein the damper member comprises: a damper cylinder; a damper rod coupled to the damper cylinder and configured to extend and retract relative to the damper cylinder; and a damper piston coupled to the damper rod, the damper cylinder and the damper piston defining a damper extension chamber and a damper retraction chamber, the damper extension chamber and the damper retraction chamber configured to send and receive fluid from the damper actuator causing extension and retraction of the damper rod relative to the damper cylinder.
10. The apparatus of claim 9, wherein the damper actuator comprises a hydraulic cylinder hydraulically coupled to the damper member via a hydraulic line and configured to cause the damper member to extend and retract.
11. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the damper actuator comprises: a damper actuator cylinder; a damper actuator rod coupled to the damper actuator cylinder and configured to extend and retract relative to the damper actuator cylinder; and a damper actuator piston coupled to the damper actuator rod, the damper actuator cylinder and the damper actuator piston defining a damper actuator extension chamber and a damper actuator retraction chamber, the damper actuator extension chamber and the damper actuator retraction chamber configured to receive fluid causing extension and retraction of the damper actuator rod relative to the damper actuator cylinder.
12. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein the damper actuator is coupled to the damper member in a non-linear manner.
