</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a technique for predicting the Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) by using the observation data for variation of length-of-day (LOD) and latitude observation. The invention provides a method of predicting the EOP in real time with high accuracy by using data of the LOD variation and latitude observation on the basis of a new mathematic model on the rotation of the Earth which can clearly explain the causes of all the astronomical phenomena related with the rotation of the Earth. The invention also provides an EOP predicting apparatus and an EOP predicting program, and a computer readable recording medium recorded with the EOP predicting program.
