<title>
Surveillance system with activity recognition
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method, system, and computer program product are provided for activity recognition in a surveillance system. The method includes receiving a plurality of unlabeled videos from one or more cameras. The method also includes classifying an activity in each of the plurality of unlabeled videos. The method additionally includes controlling an operation of a processor-based machine to react in accordance with the activity.

<claims>
1. A surveillance system utilizing activity recognition, the surveillance system comprising: one or more cameras; a processor and memory coupled to the processor forming a processing system, the processing system programmed to: receive the plurality of unlabeled videos from the one or more cameras; classify an activity in each of the plurality of unlabeled videos; and control an operation of a processor-based machine to react in accordance with the activity, wherein the processing system is further programmed to utilize a domain adversarial training system to classify the activity, and wherein the domain adversarial training system employs a frame-wise discriminator to learn differences between classified videos and the unlabeled videos at the frame level and to backpropagate the differences into a feature extraction CNN and a feature aggregation system.
2. The surveillance system as recited in claim 1, further includes a communication system.
3. The surveillance system as recited in claim 2, wherein the communication system connects to a remote server that classifies the activity.
4. The surveillance system as recited in claim 1, wherein the unlabeled video includes first person video.
5. The surveillance system as recited in claim 1, wherein the processing system is further programmed to employ a red-green-blue convolution neural network (CNN) to classify the activity.
6. The surveillance system as recited in claim 1, wherein the processing system is further programmed to employ a flow CNN to classify the activity.
7. The surveillance system as recited in claim 1, wherein the processing system is further programmed to determine an average of the frame features classify the activity.
8. The surveillance system as recited in claim 1, wherein the processing system is further programmed to determine a weighted average of the frame features responsive to a weighting factor to classify the activity.
9. The surveillance system as recited in claim 1, wherein the processing system is further programmed to employ a short-term memory neural network to classify the activity.
10. The surveillance system as recited in claim 1, wherein the processing system is further programmed to employ a gated recurrent unit network to classify the activity.
11. The surveillance system as recited in claim 10, wherein the domain adversarial training system employs a video-wise discriminator to learn differences between classified videos and the unlabeled videos after the estimating at the video level after the estimating and to backpropagate the differences into a feature extraction CNN and a feature aggregation system.
12. The surveillance system as recited in claim 1, wherein the one or more cameras is a body camera.
13. A computer program product for a surveillance system with activity recognition, the computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by a computer to cause the computer to perform a method comprising: receiving a plurality of unlabeled videos from one or more cameras; classifying an activity in each of the plurality of unlabeled videos; and controlling an operation of a processor-based machine to react in accordance with the activity, wherein the computer is further programmed to utilize a domain adversarial training system to classify the activity, and wherein the domain adversarial training system employs a frame-wise discriminator to learn differences between classified videos and the unlabeled videos at the frame level and to backpropagate the differences into a feature extraction CNN and a feature aggregation system.
14. A computer-implemented method for activity recognition in a surveillance system, the method comprising: receiving a plurality of unlabeled videos from one or more cameras; classifying an activity in each of the plurality of unlabeled videos; and controlling an operation of a processor-based machine to react in accordance with the activity, wherein classifying determines an average of the frame features, determines a weighted average of the frame features responsive to a weighting factor, and employs both a short-term memory neural network and a gated recurrent unit network.
15. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 14, wherein the unlabeled video includes first-person video.
16. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 14, wherein classifying employs a frame-wise discriminator to learn differences between the classified videos and the unlabeled videos at the frame level to backpropagate the differences into a feature extraction CNN and a feature aggregation system.
17. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 14, wherein classifying employs a video-wise discriminator to learn differences between the classified videos and the unlabeled videos at the video level to backpropagate the differences into a feature extraction CNN and a feature aggregation system.
