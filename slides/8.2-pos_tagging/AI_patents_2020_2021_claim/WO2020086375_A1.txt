SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR EFFICIENT VEHICLE CONTROL
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods, and non-transitory computer-readable media can determine a trajectory for a vehicle, the trajectory associated with a predicted path to be traveled by the vehicle. A power optimization plan is generated for the vehicle based on the trajectory. One or more power management settings are modified based on the power optimization plan.
