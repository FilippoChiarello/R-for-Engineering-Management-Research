<title>
METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR MODIFYING A SEARCH RESULT
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems for modifying a search result are described. A computing device may receive a query. A search result based on the query may be determined. The computing device may modify the search result based on a term of the query.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising, receiving, by a computing device from a user device, a search query; determining, based on the search query, a search result; determining a term of the search result that is contextually related to a term of the search query; determining, based on replacing the term of the search result with the term of the search query, a modified search result; and causing output of the modified search result.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the term of the search result that is contextually related to the term of the search query comprises determining, by using natural language processing, the term of the search result.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the term of the search result that is contextually related to the term of the search query comprises comparing, by using an ontology, the term of the search query to a plurality of ontology terms, wherein the ontology indicates one or more related ontology terms for each term of the plurality of ontology terms.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the search result comprises at least one of a title, a snippet, or a hyperlink.
5. The method of claim 1, determining, based on the search query, a search result further comprises: sending, to a computing device configured to execute a search, the search query, and receiving, from the computing device configured to execute the search, the search result.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein determining a modified search result by replacing the term of the search result with the term of the search query is based on a user profile that indicates demographics of a user who submitted the search query.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein causing output of the modified search result further comprises transmitting, to the user device, the search result, the method further comprising: determining the term of the search result that is contextually related to the term of the search query, determining the modified search result by replacing the term of the search result with the term of the search query, and causing output of the modified search result.
8. A method comprising, receiving, by a computing device from a user device, a search query and an indication of a user profile associated with a user of the user device; determining, based on the search query and the user profile, a search result; determining a term of the search result that is contextually related to a term of the search query; determining, based on the user profile and replacing the term of the search result with the term of the search query, a modified search result; and causing output of the modified search result.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein determining the term of the search result that is contextually related to the term of the search query comprises determining, by using natural language processing, the term of the search result.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein determining the term of the search result that is contextually related to the term of the search query comprises comparing, by using an ontology, the term of the search query to a plurality of ontology terms, wherein the ontology indicates one or more related ontology terms for each term of the plurality of ontology terms.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein the search result comprises at least one of a title, a snippet, or a hyperlink.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the user profile indicates demographics of the user, and wherein determining, based on the search query and the user profile, the search result comprises determining, based on the demographics of the user, the search result.
13. The method of claim 8 determining, based on the search query and the user profile, the search result further comprises: sending, to a computing device configured to execute a search, the search query, and receiving, from the computing device configured to execute the search, the search result.
14. The method of claim 8, further comprising sending, to the user device, the search result, wherein user device is configured to: determine the term of the search result that is contextually related to the term of the search query, determine, based on the user profile, the modified search result by replacing the term of the search result with the term of the search query, and cause output of the modified search result.
15. A method comprising, receiving, by a user device, a search query; sending, to a computing device configured to execute a search, the search query; receiving, from the computing device, a search result; determining, by the user device based on replacing a term of the search result with a contextually related term of the search query, a modified search result; and causing output of the modified search result.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein determining, by the user device, the modified search result by replacing the term of the search result with the contextually related term of the search query comprises determining, by using natural language processing, the term of the search result.
17. The method of claim 15, determining, by the user device, the modified search result by replacing the term of the search result with the contextually related term of the search query comprises comparing, by using an ontology, the term of the search query to a plurality of ontology terms, wherein the ontology indicates one or more related ontology terms for each term of the plurality of ontology terms.
18. The method of claim 15, wherein the search result comprises at least one of a title, a snippet, or a hyperlink.
19. The method of claim 15, wherein causing output of the modified search result comprises causing output on a display associated with the user device.
20. The method of claim 15, wherein determining, by the user device, a modified search result by replacing the term of the search result with the contextually related term of the search query is based on a user profile that indicates demographics of a user associated with the user device.
