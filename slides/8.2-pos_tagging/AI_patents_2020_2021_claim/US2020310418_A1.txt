VEHICLE CONTROL SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
In a vehicle control system, a control unit of the vehicle control system executes a stop process by which the vehicle is parked in a prescribed stop area when it is detected that the control unit or the driver has become incapable of properly maintaining a traveling state of the vehicle. In the stop process, the control unit determines a plurality of available stop areas according to the vehicle surroundings and map information, and computes, for each available stop area, a cumulative travel risk obtained by accumulating a travel risk involved in traveling from a position of the vehicle when the stop process is initiated to each available stop area and a stop risk in stopping in each available stop area, the control unit determining a final stop area by comparing the cumulative travel risk with the stop risk in each available stop area sequentially from the nearest one.

<claims>
1. A vehicle control system, comprising: a control unit for steering, accelerating, and decelerating a vehicle; an occupant monitoring device configured to monitor a driver of the vehicle; an external environment recognition device configured to acquire information on an environment surrounding the vehicle; and a map device retaining map information; wherein the control unit is configured to execute a stop process by which the vehicle is parked in a prescribed stop area when it is detected that the control unit or the driver has become incapable of properly maintaining a traveling state of the vehicle, and wherein, in the stop process, the control unit determines a plurality of available stop areas according to the information on the environment surrounding the vehicle and the map information, and computes, for each available stop area, a cumulative travel risk obtained by accumulating a travel risk involved in traveling from a position of the vehicle when the stop process is initiated to each available stop area and a stop risk in stopping in each available stop area, the control unit determining a final stop area by comparing the cumulative travel risk with the stop risk in each available stop area sequentially from the nearest one.
2. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein the control unit determines the available stop area at which the cumulative travel risk exceeds the stop risk as the final stop area.
3. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein the control unit determines the available stop area immediately preceding the one at which the cumulative travel risk exceeds the stop risk as the final stop area.
4. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein when a preceding vehicle is detected by the external environment recognition device, the control unit causes the vehicle to follow the preceding vehicle in each interval between adjoining available stop areas.
5. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein the cumulative travel risk increases monotonically with a travel distance or a travel time.
6. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein the external environment recognition device is configured to capture an image of road signs, and the control unit increases the cumulative travel risk as the image of road signs grows darker.
7. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein the control unit increases the cumulative travel risk for each unit travel distance more at night than in daytime.
8. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein the control unit increases the cumulative travel risk for each unit travel distance more on a rainy day than on a fine day.
9. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein the occupant monitoring device is configured to detect an occupant other than a driver, and the control unit increases the cumulative travel risk for each unit travel distance more when the occupant other than the driver is detected than when the occupant other than the driver is not detected.
10. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein the external environment recognition device is configured to detect a following vehicle, and the control unit increases the cumulative travel risk for each unit travel distance more when the following vehicle is detected as the vehicle is about to come to a stop in the next available stop area than when the following vehicle is not detected.
11. The vehicle control system according to claim 10, wherein the external environment recognition device is configured to detect an inter-vehicle distance between the vehicle and a following vehicle, and the control unit increases the cumulative travel risk for each unit travel distance more when the inter-vehicle distance between the following vehicle and the vehicle is equal to or lower than a prescribed value than when the inter-vehicle distance is greater than the prescribed value.
12. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein the control unit increases the cumulative travel risk for each unit travel distance more when the vehicle is traveling in a fast lane than when the vehicle is traveling in a slow lane.
13. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein the control unit increases the cumulative travel risk in a part of a road where lanes are restricted.
14. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein the control unit determines the stop risk at each available stop area from the map information.
15. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein the control unit increases the cumulative travel risk in a narrow part of a road.
16. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein the control unit increases the cumulative travel risk in a part of a route where past data indicates a high frequency of lane changes.
