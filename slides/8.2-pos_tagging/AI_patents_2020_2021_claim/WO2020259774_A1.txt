CONTROLLING POWER OUTPUT OF A WIND TURBINE AT BELOW-RATED WIND SPEED
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a method (70) of controlling power output of a wind turbine (10) at below-rated wind speed, the method (70) comprising: determining (710) an indication of blade torsion of one or more rotor blades (18) of the wind turbine (10) in dependence on wind speed and/or rotor speed; determining (720) a torsion-corrected blade pitch based on the indication of blade torsion; and using (730) the torsion-corrected blade pitch to control pitch the one or more rotor blades (18).

<claims>
1. A method (70) of controlling power output of a wind turbine (10) at below-rated wind speed, the method (70) comprising: determining (710) an indication of blade torsion of one or more rotor blades (18) of the wind turbine (10) based on a predetermined relationship between the blade torsion and at least one of the wind speed and the rotor speed; determining (720) a torsion-corrected blade pitch based on the indication of blade torsion; and using (730) the torsion-corrected blade pitch to control pitch of the one or more rotor blades (18).
2. The method (70) of claim 1 , comprising calculating a tip-speed ratio based on the rotor speed and wind speed, and wherein the torsion-corrected blade pitch is determined based on the tip-speed ratio and the indication of blade torsion. 3. The method (70) of claim 2, wherein determining (720) the torsion-corrected blade pitch comprises determining a first blade pitch based on the tip-speed ratio, determining a second blade pitch based on the indication of blade torsion, and comparing the first and second blade pitches to determine the torsion-corrected blade pitch. 4. The method (70) of claim 3, wherein one or both of the first and second blade pitches is determined using a look-up table.
5. The method (70) of claim 3 or claim 4, wherein the second blade pitch is a blade pitch offset, and wherein determining (720) the torsion-corrected blade pitch comprises adjusting the first blade pitch by the blade pitch offset.
6. The method (70) of claim 5, wherein determining the second blade pitch comprises: determining a wind speed blade pitch offset based on an indication of blade torsion determined in dependence on the wind speed;
determining a rotor speed blade pitch offset based on an indication of blade torsion determined in dependence on the rotor speed; and, calculating the second blade pitch as a sum of the wind speed and rotor speed blade pitch offsets.
7. The method (70) of claim 5 or claim 6, wherein determining the first blade pitch comprises:
determining a tip-speed ratio blade pitch based on the tip speed ratio;
determining a wind speed blade pitch based on wind speed and/or determining a rotor speed blade pitch based on rotor speed; and,
calculating the first blade pitch as the minimum of the tip-speed ratio blade pitch and the determined wind-speed blade pitch and/or rotor speed blade pitch.
8. The method (70) of claim 3 or claim 4 wherein the torsion-corrected blade pitch is determined to be a minimum of the first and second blade pitches.
9. The method (70) of any of any preceding claim, wherein the indication of blade torsion is determined in dependence on blade root flapwise bending moment.
10. The method (70) of any of any preceding claim, wherein the indication of blade torsion is determined in dependence on a current operating point of the wind turbine (10).
11. The method (70) of any of any preceding claim, wherein determining (720) the torsion-corrected blade pitch comprises:
calculating an average torsion along the length of the one or more rotor blades (18) based on the indication of blade torsion; and,
determining the torsion-corrected blade pitch based on the average torsion along the length of the one or more rotor blades (18).
12. The method (70) of any preceding claim, wherein the indication of blade torsion is calculated based on a model of the one or more rotor blades (18).
13. The method (70) of any preceding claim, wherein controlling the one or more rotor blades (18) comprises pitching the one or more rotor blades (18) to the torsion-corrected pitch angle.
14. A controller (26) for controlling power output of a wind turbine (10) at below-rated wind speed, the controller (26) being configured to: determine (710) an indication of blade torsion of one or more rotor blades (18) of the wind turbine (10) in dependence on wind speed and rotor speed; determine (720) a torsion-corrected blade pitch based on the indication of blade torsion; and, send (730) a control signal to command pitch control of the one or more rotor blades (18) using the torsion-corrected blade pitch.
15. A wind turbine (10) comprising the controller (26) of claim 14.
