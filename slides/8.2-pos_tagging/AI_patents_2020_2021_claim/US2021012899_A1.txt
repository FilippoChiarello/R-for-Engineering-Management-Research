<title>
DIAGNOSIS FOR VARIOUS DISEASES USING TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT ACTIVE PROTEINS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for disease diagnosis through the detection of multiple biomarkers by receiving concentration values of biomarkers, building a training set using the samples of the biomarkers, and performing correlation calculations on the biomarker concentration values to diagnose the disease.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method of creating an evaluative model that indicates a probability of a disease state in a patient under examination, the method comprising: a. receiving a first set of concentration values of a first biomarker from a first set of samples from patients with a not-disease diagnosis; b. receiving a second set of concentration values of the first biomarker from a second set of samples from patients with a disease diagnosis, wherein the first set and second set of samples comprise a training set of samples; c. completing a correlation computation for the first biomarker from the first set of concentration values combined with the concentration values of the first biomarker from the second set of concentration values, wherein said computation may be simple regression, neural networks, ROC curve area maximization, random forest methods, support vector machine or other industry standard methods; and d. performing steps (a) through (c) for a second biomarker wherein the second biomarker is functionally orthogonal to the first biomarker, and wherein the second biomarker is analyzed independently or in conjunction in a multi-dimensional space with the first biomarker to indicate the probability of a disease state.
2. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the training set of samples includes at least one of blood samples, urine samples, and tissue samples.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the training set of samples includes an equal number of disease samples and not-disease samples.
4. The computer implemented method of claim 3, wherein the disease being diagnosed is a. non-small cell lung cancer; or b. stages of non-small cell lung cancer segregated by stage.
5. The computer implemented method of claim 4, wherein the biomarkers are selected from functional groups of cytokines, where the functional groups are at least three of pro-inflammatory, antitumor genesis or cell apoptosis, angiogenesis, vascularization cytokine and colony stimulating factor functions.
6. The computer implemented method of claim 5, wherein one of the biomarkers is interleukin 6.
7. The computer implemented method of claim 5, wherein one of the biomarkers is vascular endothelial growth factor beta.
8. The computer implemented method of claim 5, wherein one of the colony stimulating factor functions is granulocyte-colony stimulating factor.
9. The computer implemented method of claim 5, wherein one of the pro-inflammatory factors is interleukin 1, interleukin 1Î², IL-12, or IL-18.
10. The computer implemented method of claim 5, wherein one of the antitumor genesis or cell apoptosis factors is CD254, DR3L, CD258 or TNA receptors 2.
11. The computer implemented method of claim 5, wherein one of the vascularization factors is Placental Growth Factor (PLGF), VEGF-A, VEGF-C or VEGF-D.
12. The computer implemented method of claim 5, wherein one of the colony stimulating factors is GM-CSF or macrophage stimulating factor GSF.
13. The computer implemented method of claim 3, wherein the disease being diagnosed is stages of solid tumor cancers such as breast, ovarian, melanoma; and wherein a tumor marker specific to that cancer is added to the test.
14. The computer implemented method of claim 11, wherein the samples with stage information are grouped into binary groups with each stage represented on either one side of the binary set or the other grouped with the remaining stages.
15. The computer implemented method of claim 17, wherein all of the binary groupings of samples with cancer stage are scored.
16. The computer implemented method of claim 18, wherein each sample is scored individually by adding the score for the grouped binary groups with a weighting factor representing the fractional contribution to the score for that group.
17. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the training set of samples includes samples from patients within a predetermined range of ages.
18. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the disease diagnosis is selected from the group consisting of the stages of a cancer.
19. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, wherein the cancer is selected from the group consisting of breast cancer, renal cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, melanoma and prostate cancer.
20. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, wherein the not-disease diagnosis includes four of the five stages, and the disease diagnosis includes the remaining stage.
21. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing an evaluative model created by the method of claim 1 that indicates a probability of a disease state in a patient under examination.
