SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PROVIDING PERSONALIZED PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS USING DEEP LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the present disclosure provide systems, methods, and computer-readable media that use machine learning models to enable computing devices to detect and identify cosmetic products in face images. In some embodiments, a model training system may gather training data for building the machine learning models by analyzing face images associated with tagging data. In some embodiments, a recommendation system may be configured to use the machine learning models generated by the model training system to detect products in face images, and to add information based on the detected products to a look data store, and/or to provide recommendations for similar looks from the look data store based on the detected products.

<claims>
The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows:
1. A method of training a machine learning model to detect cosmetic products in a face image, the method comprising: determining, by a computing device, a product present in the face image based on non-image data; extracting, by the computing device, a portion of the face image that includes a facial feature associated with the product; adding, by the computing device, the portion of the face image and an identification of the product to a training data set; and training, by the computing device, the machine learning model to detect the product in face images using the training data set.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising extracting the face image from a social media post.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein determining the product present in the face image based on non-image data includes: examining text associated with the social media post; and determining the product based on the text.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the product present in the face image includes: extracting a portion of the face image that includes a predetermined facial feature; detecting a color and a texture included in the portion of the face image; and determining a product associated with the detected color and texture based on laboratory measurements of the product.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the predetermined facial feature is lips.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model is a convolutional neural network.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein extracting the portion of the face image that includes the facial feature associated with the product includes using a computer vision technique.
8. A method of using one or more machine learning models to process face images, the method comprising: using, by a computing device, the one or more machine learning models to detect one or more products in a face image; determining, by the computing device, one or more recommended looks based on the one or more products in the face image; determining, by the computing device, one or more products associated with the one or more recommended looks; and presenting, by the computing device, the one or more recommended looks or the one or more products to a user.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the one or more machine learning models include one or more convolutional neural networks.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the face image is included in a social media post.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising: determining, by the computing device, a look based on the detected one or more products; determining, by the computing device, a sentiment score based on the social media post; and storing, by the computing device, the sentiment score and the look in a look data store.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein using the one or more machine learning models to detect one or more products in a face image includes: extracting a portion of the face image associated with a predetermined facial feature; and providing the portion of the face image to a machine learning model trained to identify products applied to the predetermined facial feature.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the predetermined facial feature is an eye, lips, a forehead, a cheekbone, or a nose.
14. The method of claim 8, wherein determining one or more recommended looks based on the one or more products in the face image includes: determining one or more looks that include at least one product with a color or a texture that matches a color or a texture of the detected one or more products in the face image, and at least one product that does not match the detected one or more products in the face image.
15. The method of claim 8, wherein determining one or more recommended looks based on the one or more products in the face image includes: adding a new look that includes the detected one or more products to a look data store; performing a cluster analysis on looks stored in the look data store; and determining the one or more recommended looks based on other looks included in a cluster with the new look.
16. A system for training a machine learning model to detect cosmetic products in a face image, the system comprising: circuitry for determining a product present in the face image based on non-image data; circuitry for extracting a portion of the face image that includes a facial feature associated with the product; circuitry for adding the portion of the face image and an identification of the product to a training data set; and circuitry for training the machine learning model to detect the product in face images using the training data set.
17. The system of claim 16, further comprising circuitry for extracting the face image from a social media post.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein determining the product present in the face image based on non-image data includes: examining text associated with the social media post; and determining the product based on the text.
19. The system of claim 16, wherein determining the product present in the face image includes: extracting a portion of the face image that includes a predetermined facial feature; detecting a color and a texture included in the portion of the face image; and determining a product associated with the detected color and texture based on laboratory measurements of the product.
20. The system of claim 16, wherein the machine learning model is a convolutional neural network.
