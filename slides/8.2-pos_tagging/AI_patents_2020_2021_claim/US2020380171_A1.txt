SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR MANAGING PRIVACY POLICIES USING MACHINE LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods, and devices for managing privacy policies are disclosed. In one embodiment, a method for management of a user's privacy preferences may include: identifying a computer application installed on a user electronic device, or a website accessed using a browser executed by the user electronic device; retrieving a privacy policy document analysis for a privacy policy document associated with the computer application or the website, the privacy policy document analysis comprising a valuation of a plurality of privacy policy segments within the privacy policy document; receiving a privacy preference analysis for the user, the privacy preference analysis comprising a valuation of a plurality of privacy preferences for the user; identifying a recommended action in response to the valuation of one of the privacy policy segments being outside the scope of the valuation of one of the plurality of privacy preferences; and executing the recommended action.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for management of a user's privacy preferences, comprising: in an information processing apparatus comprising at least one computer processor: identifying a computer application installed on a user electronic device, or a website accessed using a browser executed by the user electronic device; retrieving a privacy policy document analysis for a privacy policy document associated with the computer application or the website, the privacy policy document analysis comprising a valuation of a plurality of privacy policy segments within the privacy policy document; receiving a privacy preference analysis for the user, the privacy preference analysis comprising a valuation of a plurality of privacy preferences for the user; identifying a recommended action in response to the valuation of one of the privacy policy segments being outside the scope of the valuation of one of the plurality of privacy preferences; and executing the recommended action.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein a privacy policy manager executed on the electronic device identifies the computer application or website by examining network traffic to and from the electronic device.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the privacy policy document analysis is a result of natural language processing of the privacy policy document.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein each privacy policy segment comprises a privacy category, a privacy sub-category, and a privacy sub-category classification.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the valuation of the privacy policy segment is based on at least one of the privacy sub-category and the privacy sub-category classification for the privacy policy segment.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the valuation of the privacy policy segment comprises a numeric score, a letter grade, or a color code.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: modifying the valuation of the privacy policy segment based on an actual implementation of the privacy policy segment.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the valuation of a plurality of privacy preference is based on monitored user behavior.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the recommended action is to change the valuation of the user privacy preference.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the recommended action is based on an action taken by a second user.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the recommended action is based on news related to an entity associated with the computer application or website.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the recommendation is to restrict use of the computer application or website.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the restriction is a restriction on personal identifiable data communicated from the electronic device.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the recommended action is generated using a machine learning process.
15. A system for management of a user's privacy preferences, comprising: an electronic device comprising at least one computer processor; a privacy policy manager program executed by a server; a privacy policy manager computer application executed by the electronic device; and a computer application or browser executed by the electronic device that accessed a website; wherein: the privacy policy manager computer application identifies the computer application or the website accessed using the browser; the privacy policy manager computer application retrieves, from the privacy policy manager program, a privacy policy document analysis for a privacy policy document associated with the computer application or the website, the privacy policy document analysis comprising a valuation of a plurality of privacy policy segments within the privacy policy document; the privacy policy manager computer application receives a privacy preference analysis for the user, the privacy preference analysis comprising a valuation of a plurality of privacy preferences for the user; the privacy policy manager computer application identifies a recommended action in response to the valuation of one of the privacy policy segments being outside the scope of the valuation of one of the plurality of privacy preferences; and the privacy policy manager computer application executes the recommended action.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the privacy policy manager computer application identifies the application or website by examining network traffic to and from the electronic device.
17. The system of claim 15, wherein the privacy policy manager program generates the privacy policy document analysis using natural language processing of the privacy policy document.
18. The system of claim 15, wherein each privacy policy segment comprises a privacy category, a privacy sub-category, and a privacy sub-category classification, and the valuation of the privacy policy segment is based on at least one of the privacy sub-category and the privacy sub-category classification for the privacy policy segment.
19. The system of claim 15, wherein the recommended action is based on at least one of an action taken by a second user and news related to an entity associated with the application or website.
20. The system of claim 15, wherein the recommendation is to restrict personal identifiable data communicated from the electronic device.
