UI DESIGN FOR PATIENT AND CLINICIAN CONTROLLER DEVICES OPERATIVE IN A REMOTE CARE ARCHITECTURE
</title>

<abstract>
A system, method and network architecture for facilitating remote care delivery involving a patient (102, 1404) having an implantable medical device (IMD) (103, 170). Upon establishing a remote care session (159, 199) between a patient controller device (150, 1405) and a clinician programmer (180, 1424), wherein the clinician (138, 1422) and the patient (102, 1404) are remotely located with respect to each other, telehealth consultation may be provided to the patient (102, 1404) by the clinician (138, 1422) via an audiovisual (AV) communications session channel (163 A, 163B). Responsive to determining that the patient (102, 1404) requires remote therapy, one or more (re)programming instructions may be provided to the patient's IMD via a remote therapy session channel (165A, 165B) of the remote care session (159, 199) using an integrated graphical user interface (GUI) (1800 A) that may include suitable GUI controls for AV communications, remote session control as well as the remote programming of the patient's IMD (103, 170).
