MEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING APPARATUS AND STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A medical image processing apparatus of an embodiment includes processing circuitry. The processing circuitry is configured to acquire time-series medical images including blood vessels of an examination subject, the time-series medical images being fluoroscopically captured in at least one direction at a plurality of points in time, generate a blood vessel shape model including time-series variation information about the blood vessels in an analysis region of the blood vessels on the basis of the acquired time-series medical images, and perform fluid analysis of blood flowing through the blood vessels on the basis of the generated blood vessel shape model.
