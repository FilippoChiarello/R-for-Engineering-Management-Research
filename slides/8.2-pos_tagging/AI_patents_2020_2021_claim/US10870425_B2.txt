<title>
Control device, control method, and recording medium having program recorded thereon for automatic driving vehicle
</title>

<abstract>
A control device of an automatic driving vehicle identifies an object, based on an image. The control device decides a first prohibited area, based on the object. A memory stores a first planned location as a planned location where the automatic driving vehicle is to park or stop. The control device determines whether or not the automatic driving vehicle is able to park or stop at the first planned location, based on the first prohibited area and first planned location. In a case where the automatic driving vehicle is not able to be parked or stopped at the first planned location, the control device changes the planned location from the first planned location to a second planned location, sets a route from a vehicle location to the second planned location, and controls movement of the automatic driving vehicle based on the route.

<claims>
1. A control method of an automatic driving vehicle, the control method comprising: acquiring a photographic image of a photographed object; identifying the photographed object, based on the photographic image; storing, in a memory, a first planned location as a planned location where the automatic driving vehicle is to park or stop; determining whether or not a mobile body is parked or stopped at the first planned location, based on a result of the identifying and the first planned location; and in a case where the mobile body is parked or stopped at the first planned location: setting a route from a vehicle location indicating a present location of the automatic driving vehicle to the first planned location; and controlling movement of the automatic driving vehicle, based on the route, wherein the route is to return to the first planned location after passing through a second planned location where the automatic driving vehicle is planned to park or stop next.
2. A computer-readable non-transitory recording medium including a program, the program, when executed by a computer, controlling an automatic driving vehicle and causing execution of operations, the operations comprising: acquiring a photographic image of a photographed object photographed; identifying the photographed object, based on the photographic image; storing, in a memory, a first planned location as a planned location where the automatic driving vehicle is to park or stop; determining whether or not a mobile body is parked or stopped at the first planned location, based on a result of the identifying and the first planned location; and in a case where the mobile body is parked or stopped at the first planned location: setting a route from a vehicle location indicating a present location of the automatic driving vehicle to the first planned location; and controlling movement of the automatic driving vehicle, based on the route, wherein the route is to return to the first planned location after passing through a second planned location where the automatic driving vehicle is planned to park or stop next.
3. A control device of an automatic driving vehicle, the control device comprising: processing circuitry; and a memory including at least one set of instructions that, when executed by the processing circuitry, causes the processing circuitry to perform operations including: acquiring a photographic image of a photographed object; identifying the photographed object, based on the photographic image; storing, in the memory, a first planned location as a planned location where the automatic driving vehicle is to park or stop; determining whether or not a mobile body is parked or stopped at the first planned location, based on a result of the identifying and the first planned location; and in a case where the mobile body is parked or stopped at the first planned location: setting a route from a vehicle location indicating a present location of the automatic driving vehicle to the first planned location; and controlling movement of the automatic driving vehicle, based on the route, wherein the route is to return to the first planned location after passing through a second planned location where the automatic driving vehicle is planned to park or stop next.
4. The control method according to claim 1, wherein the route is to return to the first planned location after a predetermined period has elapsed.
