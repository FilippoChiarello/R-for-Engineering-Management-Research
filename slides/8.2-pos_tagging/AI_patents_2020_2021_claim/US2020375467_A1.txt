<title>
TELEMEDICINE APPLICATION OF VIDEO ANALYSIS AND MOTION AUGMENTATION
</title>

<abstract>
A system for providing video analysis and motion augmentation, particularly in the context of telemedicine applications is disclosed. In particular, the system may utilize cameras and other devices to detect macro and micro changes and movements of a being so as to assist in the detection of an anomaly associated with the being. After detecting the anomaly based on the detected macro and micro changes and movements, the system may transmit an alert identifying the anomaly and formulate a proposed request for interaction with the being. The request for interaction may be transmitted to the being, and information obtained in response to the request for interaction may be utilized by the system to assist in the determination of a diagnosis of a condition of the being. The process may be repeated as necessary until the diagnosis is confirmed and enough information associated with the being is obtained.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: detecting, by a system comprising a processor, an anomaly associated with a being based on a physiological condition associated with the being identified in first media representative of first motion of the being from a first camera; transmitting, by the system to a device associated with the being, a proposed action to be performed in relation to the being based on the anomaly; determining, by the system, based on information obtained in response to performance of the proposed action, a diagnosis associated with the being; and confirming, by the system, the diagnosis based on second media representative of second motion of the being from a second camera, wherein the second motion comprises a movement of the being that the first camera is unable to detect.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the physiological condition is a first physiological condition, and wherein the confirming comprises analyzing the second media to detect a second physiological condition associated with the being.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the proposed action to be performed in relation to the being comprises the proposed action to be performed by the being.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the proposed action to be performed in relation to the being comprises the proposed action to be performed by a physician treating the being.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the proposed action to be performed in relation to the being comprises adjusting a body part of the being.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the proposed action to be performed in relation to the being comprises performing a motion with a body part of the being.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the confirming comprises adjusting the diagnosis in response to determining that the diagnosis is not confirmed.
8. A system, comprising: a processor; and a memory that stores executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: identifying an anomaly associated with a person based on a physiological movement associated with the person identified in first media that has captured first motion of the person by a first camera; transmitting, to a device associated with the person, an action to be performed in relation to the person based on the anomaly; determining based on information obtained in response to the action being performed, a diagnosis associated with the person; and confirming the diagnosis based on second media that has captured second motion of the person by a second camera, wherein the second motion captured by the second camera comprises a movement of the person that the first camera is unable to detect.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the physiological movement is a first physiological movement, and wherein the confirming comprises analyzing the second media to detect a second physiological movement associated with the person.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the action to be performed in relation to the person comprises the action to be performed by the person.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the action to be performed in relation to the person comprises the action to be performed by a medical professional treating the person.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the action to be performed in relation to the person comprises adjusting a limb of the person.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the action to be performed in relation to the person comprises performing a motion with a limb of the person.
14. The system of claim 8, wherein the confirming comprises adjusting the diagnosis in response to determining that the diagnosis is not confirmed.
15. A non-transitory machine-readable medium, comprising executable instructions that, when executed by a processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: determining an anomaly associated with a being based on a physiological change associated with the being identified in first media capturing first motion of the being via a first camera; transmitting, a device associated with the being, an action to be performed in relation to the being based on the anomaly; determining based on information obtained in response to the action being performed, a diagnosis associated with the being; and confirming the diagnosis based on second media capturing second motion of the being via a second camera, wherein the second motion captured via the second camera comprises a movement of the being that the first camera is unable to detect.
16. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the physiological change is a first physiological change, and wherein the confirming comprises analyzing the second media to detect a second physiological change associated with the being.
17. The system of claim 8, wherein the action to be performed in relation to the being comprises the action to be performed by the being.
18. The system of claim 8, wherein the action to be performed in relation to the being comprises the action to be performed by a medical robot treating the being.
19. The system of claim 8, wherein the action to be performed in relation to the being comprises adjusting an eye of the being.
20. The system of claim 8, wherein the action to be performed in relation to the being comprises performing a motion with an eye of the being.
