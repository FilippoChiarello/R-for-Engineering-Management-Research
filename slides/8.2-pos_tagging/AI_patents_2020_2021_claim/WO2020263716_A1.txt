<title>
QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCESS FOR RADIATION THERAPY TREATMENT PLANNING
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method enables testing and evaluation of an expert human reviewer or an artificial intelligence (AI) error detection engine associated with a radiotherapy treatment planning process. Intentional errors are introduced 303 into the output of a software module or AI engine that performs a certain step in the radiotherapy treatment planning process. The efficacy of the human or AI reviewer in detecting errors can then be evaluated or tested by determining 306 whether the human or AI reviewer has detected the introduced error.

<claims>
I Claim:
1 . A computer-implemented method for quality assurance testing of a treatment planning process, the method comprising:
generating output data for a module of the treatment process, wherein the output data is based on input data for the module and includes at least one error;
submitting the output data to a reviewer for an error check;
receiving an error check response associated with the reviewer; and
when the error check response indicates a failure to detect the at least one error, performing a corrective action associated with the reviewer.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 , wherein the reviewer comprises a machine learning process configured to check an output of the module for errors.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, wherein the corrective action comprises generating an identifier that is associated with the machine learning process and indicates the machine learning process is eligible for retraining.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 2 or 3, wherein the corrective action comprises modifying the machine learning process based on the at least one error.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, 3 or 4, wherein modifying the machine learning process based on the at least one error comprises retraining the machine learning process based on normal output data from the module that is generated from the input data.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 5, wherein retraining the machine learning process based on the normal output data from the module comprises processing as an expected output the normal output data with a discriminator function of the machine learning process.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 5 or 6, wherein retraining the machine learning process based on the normal output data from the module further comprises processing as an input object the output data that is based on input data for the module and includes at least one error with a generator function of the machine learning process.
8. The computer-implemented method of any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the reviewer comprises a user trained to perform the error check.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 8, wherein the corrective action includes at least one of updating a credibility rating of the user and causing an indication that the user failed to detect the error to be displayed to the user.
10. The computer-implemented method of any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein generating the output data for the module comprises:
receiving normal output data from the module that is based on the input data; and modifying the normal output data.
11 . The computer-implemented method of claim 10, wherein modifying the normal output data comprises:
retrieving an error that is stored in an error database; and
incorporating the error into the normal output data.
12. The computer-implemented method of claim 10 or 11 , wherein modifying the normal output data comprises processing the normal output data with a machine learning process configured to incorporate a suitable error into output data from the module.
13. The computer-implemented method of claim 12, wherein processing the normal output data with the machine learning process comprises processing the normal output data with a generator function of the machine learning process.
14. The computer-implemented method of any one of claims 1 to 13, wherein generating the output data for the module comprises:
receiving the input data for the module; and
generating the output data by processing the input data with an error-generating module instead of with the module of the treatment process.
15. The computer-implemented method of claim 14, wherein the error-generating module comprises a machine learning process configured to generate the output data with an error associated with the module of the treatment process.
16. The computer-implemented method of any one of claims 1 to 15, further comprising, when the error check response indicates the reviewer detected the at least one error, updating a credibility rating of the user.
17. The computer-implemented method of any one of claims 1 to 16, further comprising, when the error check response indicates the reviewer detected the at least one error and the reviewer comprises a machine learning process configured to check an output of the module for errors, updating the machine learning process based on the error.
18. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium including instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, configure the one or more processors to perform the steps of:
generating output data for a module of the treatment process, wherein the output data is based on input data for the module and includes at least one error;
submitting the output data to a reviewer for an error check;
receiving an error check response associated with the reviewer; and
when the error check response indicates a failure to detect the at least one error, performing a corrective action associated with the reviewer.
19. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 18, wherein the reviewer comprises a machine learning process configured to check an output of the module for errors.
20. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 19, wherein the corrective action comprises generating an identifier that is associated with the machine learning process and indicates the machine learning process is eligible for retraining.
21 . The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim any one of claims 18 to 20, wherein the instructions further configure the one or more processors to perform the steps of any one of claims 4 to 17.
