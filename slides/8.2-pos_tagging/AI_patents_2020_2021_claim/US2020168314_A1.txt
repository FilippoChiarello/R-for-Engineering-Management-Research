METHODS TO ENABLE PERSONALIZED NUTRITION
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention generally relates to a method to enable personalized nutrition through the individualization of nutritional requirements and nutritional guidance in a subject or group of subjects. A method of maintaining personal nutrient and micronutrient levels in a subject or group of subjects is also provided.

<claims>
1. A method to enable personalized nutrition through the individualization of nutritional requirements and nutritional guidance in a subject or group of subjects, said method comprising the steps of i) measuring zero, one or more values of one or more metabolic and/or nutritional markers M from said subject or group of subjects, ii) applying an adaptive Bayesian model on the zero, one or more values measured for the one or more markers M of step i) to derive individual distributions of expected values for each marker M in said subject or group of subjects, iii) deriving from said individual distributions some individual reference Z scores and individual reference ranges for a given specificity level of each marker M, iv) measuring one or more additional values for one or more markers M in said subject or group of subjects, v) comparing said one or more measured values to said one or more individual reference Z score and individual reference ranges, wherein a deviation of said one or more measured values from said one or more individual reference Z scores and ranges is indicative of a specific nutritional requirement in said subject or group of subjects, and vi) providing a nutritional recommendation that would address said nutritional requirement.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein said zero, one or more values of one or more markers M are measured from a human subject or group of human subjects.
3. The method of claims 1 and 2, wherein the presence or absence of a specific nucleotide sequence associated to a genetic polymorphism of said one or more markers M or specific physiological status in said subject or group of subjects is inferred from said one or more values in step i).
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the presence of the E2 variant of marker Apolipoprotein E in said subject or group of subjects is inferred from measured alpha-tocopherol levels.
5. The method of any preceding claim, wherein a deviation of said one or more measured values from said one or more individual reference Z scores and individual reference ranges for a given nutrient and/or micronutrient and/or additional markers is indicative of a specific nutritional requirement in step v).
6. The method of any preceding claim, wherein said markers M are selected from fatty acids, amino acids, organic acids, minerals, hydrosoluble vitamins, liposoluble vitamins and other indicators of metabolic and/or nutritional status.
7. The method of any preceding claim, wherein said markers M are selected from metabolic and/or nutritional marker lists 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
8. The method of any preceding claim, wherein said markers M are selected from metabolic and/or nutritional marker lists 1a, 2a, 4a, 5a, 6a, and 7a.
9. The method of any preceding claim, wherein said zero, one or more values of one or more markers M are measured in one or more of blood, serum, plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, urine, saliva, skin swab, hair, aqueous humour, or sweat.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein said zero, one or more values of one or more markers M are measured in blood.
11. A method of maintaining personal nutrient and micronutrient levels in a subject or group of subjects, said method comprising a. applying a statistical method on measured metabolic and/or nutritional marker levels in order to derive an individual reference range for a given nutrient, b. comparing the measurements of one or more additional metabolic and/or nutritional marker values to their individual reference ranges in order to define nutritional requirements in said subject or group of subjects, c. providing a recommendation that would address said nutritional requirements, d. providing a personalized nutrition management solution to said subject or group of subjects in order to correct deviations of the measured metabolic and/or nutritional marker values that are outside of the individual reference ranges towards values which are back within the individual reference ranges.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the statistical method is an adaptive Bayesian model.
13. The method of claims 11 and 12, wherein said personalized nutrition management solution is a foodstuff, beverage and/or a supplement.
14. A method of obtaining individual reference ranges for a human subject or group of subjects using an adaptive Bayesian model, wherein specific nutritional needs are identified based on said ranges, and wherein a foodstuff, beverage, or supplement with a specific composition that would fulfill those nutritional needs is provided to the subject or group of subjects.
15. A device, system or apparatus that provides a nutritional recommendation and/or personalized nutrition management solution to a subject or group of subjects in need according to the method of claims 1 to 14.
