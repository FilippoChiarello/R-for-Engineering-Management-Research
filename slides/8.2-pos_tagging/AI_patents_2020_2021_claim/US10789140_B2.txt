<title>
Facilitation of replication progress tracking
</title>

<abstract>
Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) uses a specific method for disk capacity management, where disk space is partitioned into a set of blocks of fixed size called chunks. Chunk data can comprise user data and all kinds of metadata. The replication mechanism implemented in ECS works at the chunk level. However, object level data can be used to provide visibility for client applications. Thus, object arrival can be determined to track replication progress at the object level for systems with a replication mechanism that works at the chunk level.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: storing, by a device comprising a processor, first metadata, of an object created in a first zone of a data store, in a first data structure associated with a second zone of the data store different than the first zone; in response to a condition being determined to have been satisfied, determining, by the device, that the first metadata is stored in the first data structure; receiving, by the device, second metadata associated with the object in the first zone; in response to the receiving the second metadata and based on a result of analyzing the second metadata, generating third metadata, associated with the object, in a second data structure associated with the second zone; and in response to the determining that the first metadata is stored in the first data structure, storing a time, associated with the first metadata, in a third data structure.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving, by the device, the first metadata of the object created in the first zone of the data store.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: analyzing, by the device, the second metadata to generate the result.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: generating, by the device, a timestamp, associated with the first metadata.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: in response to the condition being determined not to have been satisfied, generating, by the device, a request to store the first metadata.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: in response to the condition being determined to have been satisfied, performing, by the device, an identification check related to the first metadata of the first data structure.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: based on the condition being determined to have been satisfied, generating, by the device, message data to be sent to a data management service.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the condition comprises comparing first identification data associated with the second metadata to second identification data associated with the first metadata.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising: in response to the condition being determined not to have been satisfied, storing, by the device, the second metadata.
10. A system, comprising: a processor; and a memory that stores executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: replicating first data associated with an object from a first data structure associated with a first zone of a data store to a second data structure associated with a second zone of the data store; replicating second data associated with the object from a third data structure associated with the first zone to a fourth data structure associated with the second zone; storing the object in the fourth data structure; and in response to the storing the object in the fourth data structure, generating a request to store the object in the second data structure.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the generating is performed in response to third data being determined to not be present within the second data structure.
12. The system of claim 10, wherein the operations further comprise: based on third data being determined to not be present, associating the third data with the object.
13. The system of claim 10, wherein the operations further comprise: in response to associating third data with the object, generating a temporary fourth data to be inserted into a cell of the second data structure.
14. The system of claim 10, wherein the operations further comprise: replicating third data from the first data structure to the second data structure to replace the temporary fourth data.
15. The system of claim 10, wherein the operations further comprise: in response to replicating third data from the first data structure to the second data structure to replace the temporary fourth data, generating a time stamp associated with the object.
16. The system of claim 10, wherein the operations further comprise: in response to replicating third data from the first data structure to the second data structure to replace the temporary fourth data, comparing the second data structure to the fourth data structure to determine corresponding data.
17. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium comprising instructions that, in response to execution, cause a server device comprising a processor to perform operations, comprising: facilitating sending first data from a first data structure associated with a first zone of a data store to a second data structure associated with a second zone of the data store, wherein the first data is associated with an object; facilitating sending second data from a third data structure associated with the first zone to a fourth data structure associated with the second zone, wherein the second data is associated with the object; and in response to storing the object with the fourth data structure, storing the object with the second data structure.
18. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein the registering the object with the second data structure comprises generating transient data for an entry of the second data structure.
19. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein the operations further comprise: facilitating sending third data from the first data structure to the second data structure, wherein the third data replaces the transient data.
20. The computer-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein the operations further comprise: in response to storing the third data with the second data structure, generating time data associated with the object.
