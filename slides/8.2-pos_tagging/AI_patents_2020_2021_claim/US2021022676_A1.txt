MONITORING DEVICES AND METHODS
</title>

<abstract>
Monitoring devices and monitoring technology are disclosed for a number of applications. A monitoring device that attaches to a measurement site includes at least one of an optical sensor, a temperature sensor, or first and second electrical contact sensors. A monitoring device or a smart garment can be powered by one or more bio-batteries that is each formed by electrodes in contact with the user's body (e.g., skin) or an animal. Various method and algorithms can be used to process signals received from the optical sensor, a temperature sensor, and/or first and second electrical contact sensors. The signals received from the optical sensor, a temperature sensor, and/or first and second electrical contact sensors can be transmitted to a host device. An application program on a host device can process the signals to compute one or more physiological parameters, waveform data, trend data, and/or one or more reports.

<claims>
1. A monitoring device, comprising: an optical sensor within an enclosure of the monitoring device and comprising a light source and a photodetector, wherein the light source is operable to emit light towards the measurement site and the photodetector is operable to receive light reflected from the measurement site when the monitoring device is in contact with a measurement site of a body part of a user; an auxiliary sensor within the enclosure; a wireless communication device; a processing device operably connected to the optical sensor, the auxiliary sensor, and the wireless communication device; and a memory operably connected to the processing device and storing instructions, that when executed by the processing device, cause operations to be performed, the operations comprising: receiving a data stream from the optical sensor; receiving an auxiliary data stream from the auxiliary sensor; demodulating and demultiplexing the data stream to produce at least two individual data streams; decimating the at least two individual data streams to produce at least two decimated individual data steams; demodulating and demultiplexing the auxiliary data stream to produce a time-multiplexed data stream; and transmitting, using the wireless communication device, the at least two decimated individual data streams and the time-multiplexed data stream to a computing device.
2. The monitoring device of claim 1, wherein the monitoring device is incorporated into a hat worn by the user.
3. The monitoring device of claim 1, wherein the computing device is incorporated into a space suit.
4. The monitoring device of claim 1, wherein the monitoring device comprises a wearable patch and a monofilament is used to attach the wearable patch to the measurement site.
5. The monitoring device of claim 1, further comprising an encapsulation assembly encapsulating the enclosure and configured to attach the monitoring device to the measurement site using an adhesive on a surface of the encapsulation assembly, wherein the encapsulation assembly comprises: a sensor window positioned over the optical sensor; a contact opening extending through an encapsulation component of the encapsulation assembly for receiving a first removable tab, the first removable tab including a liner layer portion disposed on a first surface of the encapsulation component covering at least one contact pad on a printed circuit board and a tab portion disposed on an opposite second surface of the encapsulation component; and a second removable tab positioned on a surface of the encapsulation assembly, the second removable tab including an adhesive material that provides the adhesive layer on the surface of the encapsulation assembly when the second removable tab is removed from the encapsulation assembly.
