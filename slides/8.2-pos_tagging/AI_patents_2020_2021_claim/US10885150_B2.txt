<title>
System and a method for assessing patient treatment risk using open data and clinician input
</title>

<abstract>
A system including a healthcare risk engine to provide a healthcare risk knowledge graph from open data and knowledge data related to risk by using risk-related terms to retrieve documents from open data and by extracting the healthcare risk knowledge graph as entities from the documents and links between the entities. A patient risk graph predictor predicts risks for a patient by combining information in a Patient Clinical Object (PCO) with entities in the healthcare risk knowledge graph to produce a patient risk graph. An impact estimator estimates an impact of a treatment by taking the treatment and adjacent nodes from the healthcare risk knowledge graph to form a healthcare treatment subgraph, finding an entity and adjacent nodes in the patient risk graph to form a patient treatment subgraph, providing an impact graph by combining the patient treatment subgraph and the healthcare treatment subgraph, and retaining resultant linked nodes.

5. A system according to claim 1, wherein the patient risk graph prediction module is a meta-predictor to perform the matching and which is arranged to use the PCO graph in two or more of predictors to produce corresponding respective specific patient risk subgraphs from the healthcare risk knowledge graph, the two or more predictors including: a diagnosis-based predictor to provide a specific patient risk subgraph based on previous diagnoses, a drug-based predictor to provide a specific patient risk subgraph based on previous drugs taken by the patient, a symptom-based predictor to provide a specific patient risk subgraph based on previous symptoms of the patient, and a treatment-based predictor to provide a specific patient risk subgraph based on treatments the patient is receiving; and wherein the meta predictor is to indicate predictions by organizing and processing the corresponding respective specific patient risk subgraphs produced by the two or more predictors into the specific patient risk graph.
6. A system according to claim 1, wherein the impact estimator module takes any nodes matching a healthcare treatment subgraph node and nodes within 1 or 2 or 3 links from the matching node to form the specific patient treatment subgraph.
