<title>
EFFICIENT PERCENTILE ESTIMATION FOR APPLICANT RANKINGS
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosed embodiments provide a system for processing a query for a ranking of candidates for an opportunity. During operation, the system obtains parameters associated with a query for a ranking of candidates for an opportunity, wherein the parameters include a candidate and the opportunity. Next, the system matches one or more of the parameters to a fixed number of quantile thresholds calculated from a distribution of scores for the candidates. The system then estimates, based on the fixed number of quantile thresholds, a quantile for a score of the candidate. Finally, the system outputs a position of the candidate within the ranking based on the estimated quantile.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: obtaining parameters associated with a query for a ranking of candidates for an opportunity, wherein the parameters comprise a candidate and the opportunity; matching, by a computer system, one or more of the parameters to a fixed number of quantile thresholds calculated from a distribution of scores for the candidates; estimating, by the computer system based on the fixed number of quantile thresholds, a quantile for a score of the candidate; and outputting a position of the candidate within the ranking based on the estimated quantile.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: identifying the candidates for the opportunity; and updating the fixed number of quantile thresholds from the distribution of scores for the candidates.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the candidates for the opportunity are identified based on at least one of: viewing the opportunity; and applying to the opportunity.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the candidates for the opportunity are identified based on at least one of: qualifications for the opportunity; and a set of rules.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein calculating the fixed number of quantile thresholds based on the scores for the candidates comprises: calculating score values representing a set of fixed quantiles in the distribution of scores.
6. The method of claim 2, wherein calculating the fixed number of quantile thresholds based on the scores for the candidates comprises: selecting a set of quantiles for a machine learning model used to produce the scores for the candidates; and calculating score values representing the set of quantiles in the distribution of scores.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein estimating the quantile for the score of the candidate comprises: applying an interpolation technique to the quantile thresholds to estimate the quantile for the score of the candidate.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: calculating, by a machine learning model, the score for the candidate from features for the candidate.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the ranking is associated with at least one of: a job view; a job recommendation; a candidate recommendation; a connection recommendation; and a job search.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the set of parameters further comprises a ranking category.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the ranking category is at least one of: an overall ranking; a skills-based ranking; a ranking based on previous positions of the candidate; and a ranking based on a current position of the candidate.
12. A system, comprising: one or more processors; and memory storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the system to: obtain parameters associated with a query for a ranking of candidates for an opportunity, wherein the parameters comprise a candidate and the opportunity; match one or more of the parameters to a fixed number of quantile thresholds calculated from a distribution of scores for the candidates; estimate, based on the fixed number of quantile thresholds, a quantile for a score of the candidate; and output a position of the candidate within the ranking based on the estimated quantile.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the memory further stores instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the system to: identify the candidates for the opportunity; and update the fixed number of quantile thresholds from the distribution of scores for the candidates.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein calculating the fixed number of quantile thresholds based on the scores for the candidates comprises: calculating score values representing a set of fixed quantiles in the distribution of scores.
15. The system of claim 13, wherein calculating the fixed number of quantile thresholds based on the scores for the candidates comprises: selecting a set of quantiles for a machine learning model used to produce the scores for the candidates; and calculating score values representing the set of quantiles in the distribution of scores.
16. The system of claim 12, wherein estimating the quantile for the score of the candidate comprises: applying an interpolation technique to the fixed number of quantile thresholds to estimate the quantile for the score of the candidate.
17. The system of claim 12, wherein the ranking is associated with at least one of: a job view; a job recommendation; a candidate recommendation; a connection recommendation; and a job search.
18. The system of claim 12, wherein the set of parameters further comprises a ranking category.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein the ranking category is at least one of: an overall ranking; a skills-based ranking; a ranking based on previous positions of the candidate; and a ranking based on a current position of the candidate
20. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that when executed by a computer cause the computer to perform a method, the method comprising: obtaining parameters associated with a query for a ranking of candidates for an opportunity, wherein the parameters comprise a candidate and the opportunity; matching one or more of the parameters to a fixed number of quantile thresholds calculated from a distribution of scores for the candidates; estimating, based on the fixed number of quantile thresholds, a quantile for a score of the candidate; and outputting a position of the candidate within the ranking based on the estimated quantile.
