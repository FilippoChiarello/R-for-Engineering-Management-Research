AUTOMATIC DISHWASHING COMPOSITIONS AND METHOD OF CLEANING ARTICLES
</title>

<abstract>
An automatic dishwashing composition is provided including a maleic acid/olefin copolymer; a dispersant polymer, comprising a copolymer of acrylic acid and a sulfonated monomer; a builder; and a surfactant of formula (I): wherein R1 is a linear or branched, saturated C8-24 alkyl group; R2 is a linear saturated C2‑8 alkyl group; m is 26 to 42; n is 4 to 12; m + n is 30 to 54; wherein the fatty alcohol alkoxylate of formula (I) has an average ethyleneoxy unit concentration per molecule, X, of > 45 wt%; and, wherein the fatty alcohol alkoxylate of formula I has ratio, Z, equal to average ethyleneoxy unit concentration per molecule, X, divided by n; wherein ratio, Z, is < 9.5. Also provided is a method of cleaning articles in an automatic dishwashing machine while maintaining cleanliness of the automatic dishwashing machine.

<claims>
We claim:
1. An automatic dishwashing composition comprising:
a maleic acid/olefin copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of 2,500 to 20,000 Daltons;
a dispersant polymer, comprising a copolymer of acrylic acid and sulfonated monomer;
a builder; and
a surfactant, wherein the surfactant is a fatty alcohol alkoxylate of formula I:
wherein R1 is a linear or branched, saturated C8-24 alkyl group; wherein R2 is a linear saturated C2-8 alkyl group; wherein m has an average value of 26 to 42; wherein n has an average value of 4 to 12; wherein m + n is an average value of 30 to 54; wherein the fatty alcohol alkoxylate of formula I has an average ethyleneoxy unit concentration per molecule, X, of > 45 wt%; and, wherein the fatty alcohol alkoxylate of formula I has a ratio, Z, equal to the average ethyleneoxy unit concentration per molecule, X, divided by n; wherein the ratio, Z, is < 9.5.
2. The automatic dishwashing composition of claim 1, wherein the weight ratio of (i) the maleic acid/olefin copolymer to (ii) the fatty alcohol alkoxylate of formula I is £
10:1.
3. The automatic dishwashing composition of claim 2, wherein the dispersant polymer further comprises an acrylic acid homopolymer; wherein the dispersant polymer is a blend of (a) the acrylic acid homopolymer and (b) the copolymer of acrylic acid and sulfonated monomer.
4. The automatic dishwashing composition of claim 3, wherein the blend has a blend weight ratio of (a) the acrylic acid homopolymer to (b) the copolymer of acrylic acid and sulfonated monomer of 3: 1 to 1:3.
5. The automatic dishwashing composition of claim 4, wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of a mixture of a hexadecyl group and an octadecyl group; and wherein R2 is a C2 alkyl group.
6. The automatic dishwashing composition of claim 4, wherein the average ethyleneoxy unit concentration per molecule, X, is 50 to 64.5 wt%; and, wherein the ratio, Z, is 4 to 9.4.
7. The automatic dishwashing composition of claim 4, wherein the maleic acid/olefin copolymer is a copolymer of maleic acid and di-isobutylene.
8. The automatic dishwashing composition of claim 4, wherein the surfactant is a mixture of fatty alcohol alkoxylate compounds of formula I, wherein the surfactant is a mixture containing two different alkyl groups R1, wherein the two different alkyl groups R1 are hexadecyl groups and octadecyl groups; wherein R2 is a C2 alkyl group; wherein the average ethyleneoxy unit concentration per molecule, X, is 50 to 64.5 wt%; and wherein the ratio, Z, is 4 to 9.4.
9. The automatic dishwashing composition of claim 4, further comprising an optional component selected from the group consisting of a bleaching agent, a bleach activator, a bleach catalyst, an enzyme, an aminocarboxylate chelant, a filler, and mixtures thereof; and wherein the builder is selected from the group consisting of alkali metal carbonate, alkali metal bicarbonate, alkali metal percarbonate, alkali metal citrate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate, and ammonium percarbonate.
10. A method of cleaning an article in an automatic dishwashing machine while maintaining the cleanliness of the automatic dishwashing machine, comprising:
providing at least one food soiled article;
providing an automatic dishwashing machine having a drain line with a non-metal strainer;
providing water;
selecting an automatic dishwashing composition according to claim 1 , wherein the automatic dishwashing composition is specifically selected both for washing the food soiled article and for maintaining the cleanliness of the non-metal strainer by reducing the buildup of food soil on the non-metal strainer during use of the automatic dishwashing machine; applying the water and the automatic dishwashing composition to the at least one food soiled article forming a cleaned article and a food soiled water; and
draining the food soiled water through the non-metal strainer.
