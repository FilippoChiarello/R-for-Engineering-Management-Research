Robot controller, machine learning device and machine learning method
</title>

<abstract>
A controller is provided with a machine learning device learning an operation start condition for storing motions for an article on the carrier device by means of the robot. The machine learning device observes operation start condition data showing the operation start condition and conveyance state data showing states of articles on the carrier device, as state variables indicating a current state of an environment. Further, the machine learning device acquires judgment data showing an appropriateness judgment result of the storing motion and learns the operation start condition in association with the conveyance state data, using the observed state variables and the acquired judgment data.

<claims>
1. A controller configured to control a robot for grasping at least one article placed on an operating carrier device and store the grasped article to a predetermined position, the controller comprising: a processor configured to learn an operation start condition for storing motion for the article placed on the operating carrier device by means of the robot for grasping the article placed on the operating carrier device and storing the article to a predetermined position, wherein the processor is configured to: acquire, as state variables indicating a current state of an environment, (i) operation start condition data showing the operation start condition and (ii) conveyance state data showing a state of the article placed on the operating carrier device, acquire judgment data showing an appropriateness judgment result of the storing motion, and learn the operation start condition in association with the conveyance state data, using the state variables and the judgment data, wherein the judgment data comprises a number of missed articles, torque of a motor driving the robot, or vibration occurring on the robot.
2. The controller according to claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to observe classification information that identifies a classification of the article as the state variables; and the processor is configured to learn the operation start condition in association with both of the conveyance state data and the classification information.
3. The controller according to claim 1, wherein the judgment data comprises at least one of a cycle time required to store a predetermined number of articles, the number of articles the robot has missed on the operating carrier device, torque of a motor driving the robot at the time of storing the articles by means of the robot, and vibration which occurs at the time of storing the articles by means of the robot.
4. The controller according to claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to: determine a reward related to the appropriateness judgment result; and update a function indicating value of the operation start condition for the state of the article placed on the operating carrier device, using the reward.
5. The controller according to claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to perform multi-layered calculation of the state variables and the judgment data.
6. The controller according to claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to output an instruction value based on the operation start condition in association with the conveyance state data.
7. The controller according to claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to learn the operation start condition for each of a plurality of robots, using the state variables and the judgment data obtained for each of the plurality of robots.
8. A processor configured to learn an operation start condition for a storing motion for at least one article placed on an operating carrier device by means of a robot for grasping the at least one article placed on the operating carrier device and storing the article to a predetermined position, the processor is configured to: acquire, as state variables indicating a current state of an environment, (i) operation start condition data showing the operation start condition and (ii) conveyance state data showing a state of the article placed on the operating carrier device, acquire judgment data showing an appropriateness judgment result of the storing motion, and learn the operation start condition in association with the conveyance state data, using the state variables and the judgment data, wherein the judgment data comprises a number of missed articles, torque of a motor driving the robot, or vibration occurring on the robot.
9. A machine learning method for learning an operation start condition for a storing motion for at least one article placed on an operating carrier device by means of a robot for grasping the at least one article placed on the operating carrier device and storing the article to a predetermined position, the machine learning method comprising the steps of: observing operation start condition data that shows the operation start condition and conveyance state data that shows a state of the article placed on the operating carrier device, as state variables indicating a current state of an environment; acquiring judgment data that shows an appropriateness judgment result of the storing motion; and learning the operation start condition in association with the conveyance state data, using the state variables and the judgment data.
