SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DETECTING THE STATUS OF A PARTICLE FILTER
</title>

<abstract>
The invention provides a monitoring device for monitoring an air cleaning system for determining when a particle filter of the air cleaning system needs cleaning or replacement. The monitoring device is a remote unit for application to the air cleaning system when a periodic monitoring function is to be performed. It is used to monitor changes in the sound made by the air cleaning system over time to derive information relating to the filter status.

<claims>
1. A monitoring device (20) for monitoring an air cleaning system for determining when a particle filter of the air cleaning system needs cleaning or replacement, wherein the monitoring device comprises a remote monitoring device which is for application to the air cleaning system when a periodic monitoring function is to be performed and for removal from the air cleaning system between periodic monitoring functions, wherein the monitoring device comprises:
a microphone (22) adapted to capture sounds of the air cleaning system during use and generating microphone signals;
a processor (24) adapted to process the microphone signals and for monitoring changes in the microphone signals over time; and
an output device (26) adapted to provide information relating to the filter status based on the evolution of the microphone signals.
2. A monitoring device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the monitoring device (20) is for application to a specific monitoring location (19) of the air cleaning system or for positioning at a specific monitoring location relative to the air cleaning system.
3. A monitoring device as claimed in claim 2, wherein the specific monitoring location (19) of the air cleaning system is in the vicinity of an air outlet (18).
4. A monitoring device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the processor (24) is adapted to operate a machine learning algorithm.
5. A monitoring device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, comprising a smartphone or tablet.
6 An air cleaning system, comprising: an air inlet (12);
a particle filter (14);
a fan (16) for driving air through the particle filter; and
an outlet (18),
wherein the air cleaning system further comprises a docking area (19) which is adapted to function as a monitoring location to which the monitoring device (20) of claim 1 to 5 is applied, for performing a periodic monitoring function of the air cleaning system, thereby for providing information relating to the filter status based on the evolution of the sound generated at the docking area.
7. An air cleaning system as claimed in claim 6, wherein the docking area (19) is in the vicinity of the air outlet.
8. An air cleaning system as claimed in claim 6 or 7, further comprising software for loading on a smartphone or tablet thereby to implement the remote monitoring device.
9. A method for monitoring an air cleaning system for determining when a particle filter of the air cleaning system needs cleaning or replacement, comprising:
(34) applying a remote monitoring device to the air cleaning system or positioning a remote monitoring device relative to the air cleaning system thereby to perform a periodic monitoring function;
during the periodic monitoring function:
(35) capturing sounds of the air cleaning system during use using a microphone and generating microphone signals; and
(36) processing the microphone signals and monitoring changes in the microphone signals over time;
(38) providing information relating to the filter status based on the evolution of the microphone signals; and
(40) removing the remote monitoring device from the air cleaning system between the periodic monitoring functions. 10. A method as claimed in claim 9, comprising applying the monitoring device to a specific monitoring location (19) of the air cleaning system for the periodic monitoring. 11. A method as claimed in claim 10, wherein the specific monitoring location
(19) of the air cleaning system is in the vicinity of an air outlet.
12. A method as claimed in any one of claims 9 to 11, comprising training and operating a machine learning algorithm to enable information relating to the filter status to be provided based on the evolution of the microphone signals.
13. A computer program comprising computer program code means which is adapted, when said program is run on a computer, to implement the steps in the method of any one of claims 9 to 12 of processing the microphone signals and monitoring changes in the microphone signals over time and providing information relating to the filter status based on the evolution of the microphone signals.
