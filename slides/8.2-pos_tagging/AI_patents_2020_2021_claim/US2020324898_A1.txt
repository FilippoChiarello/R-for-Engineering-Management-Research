METHOD AND ALGORITHM FOR FLIGHT, MOVEMENT, AUTONOMY, IN GPS, COMMUNICATION, DEGRADED, DENIED, OBSTRUCTED NON OPTIMAL ENVIRONMENT
</title>

<abstract>
A method for enhancing movement or autonomy, including movement or flight of vehicles or flight vehicles in communication and or GPS degraded and or denied and or non-optimal environments is presented, where 3D area maps and or area maps may be employed, and 3D area maps and or area maps employed may include embedded position, location or GPS date, where the location or GPS data may be used in the present invention to determine vehicle location through image recognition, and using the GPS coordinates or location from the 3D area map of the image recognized, or measuring distance to other know aspects of a 3D area map in the real world, and context or system level information may also be used to estimate obstacle shapes and optimal routes in a potential route of travel or for understanding an area.

<claims>
1. A method of vehicle operation comprising: storing at least one area map encoded with geo-location information in a vehicle; using onboard sensors of the vehicle to sense a surrounding environment and detecting objects in the surrounding environment within the area map; and obtaining, at the vehicle, geo-location data from at least one area map of the detected objects in the surrounding environment and the using geo-location data information to estimate a geo-location of the vehicle.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the vehicle is in an area with a denied, degraded, or otherwise lacking GPS signal.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the vehicle is autonomous.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the vehicle is a flight vehicle.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the vehicle is a flight vehicle that is a multi-rotorcraft.
6. A apparatus for a vehicle comprising: a computer system comprising a processor, memory accessible by the processor, and computer program instructions stored in the memory and executable by the processor, and configured to store at least one of area maps, images, geo-tagged area maps, and geo-tagged images, and configured to search the at least one of maps or images for specified objects and scenes; sensors configured to send obtain information about a surrounding environment of the vehicle to the computer system; and wherein the computer system is further configured detect objects and scenes in the surrounding environment from the sensor information, to compare the detected objects and scenes the surrounding environment to objects and scenes in the at least one of maps or images, and to load geo-tagged information about those objects and scenes that match.
7. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the sensors comprise visual cameras and the computer system is further configured for object detection.
8. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the sensors comprise distance measuring sensors and the computer system is further configured to use distance point clouds.
9. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the computer system is further configured to fuse image recognition with point cloud distance information.
10. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the computer system is further configured to be modular so as to have a capability of adding features and capabilities that are configured to detect objects in a surrounding, compare them to information in area maps and or images, and output metadata of such objects or scenes detected as a capability enhancing output of such an apparatus.
11. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the vehicle is a flight vehicle.
12. The apparatus of claim 6 wherein the computer system is further configured estimate flight routes.
13. The apparatus of claim 6 wherein the computer system is further configured direct the vehicle in flight routes.
14. The apparatus of claim 6 wherein the computer system is further configured direct a vehicle along flight routes by updating and or changing controls or control systems.
