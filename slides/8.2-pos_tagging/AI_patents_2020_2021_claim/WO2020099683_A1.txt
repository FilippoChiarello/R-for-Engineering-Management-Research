METABOLITES FOR USE IN OVARIAN CANCER DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to new metabolite panels for assessing ovarian cancer. Moreover, the present invention relates to a method for assessing ovarian cancer from a subject to be examined, and to a kit for carrying out the method.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. Use of a combination of metabolites contained in a sample of a mammalian subject for assessing ovarian cancer, the combination of metabolites comprising
1) at least one amino acid selected from the group of Alanine (Ala), Asparagine (Asn), Citrulline (Cit), glutamate (Glu), tryptophane (Trp), and
2) at least one biogenic amine selected from the group of Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), c/s-4-Hydroxyproline (c4-OH-Pro), Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA),
3) at least one acylcarnitine selected from the group of acylcamitine C4:0, acylcamitine C16: l,
4) lysophosphatidylcholine Cl 8:2
5) at least one phosphatidylcholine selected from the group of PC(34:5), PC(35: 1), PC(42:4), PC-O(30:0), PC-0(32:3), and
6) at least one sphingolipid selected from SM(32:2), SM(42: 1)
in the in vitro or ex vivo detection, diagnosis, prognosis and/or therapy monitoring of ovarian cancer.
2. The use according to claim 1, wherein the detection, diagnosis and/or prognosis of ovarian cancer comprises:
ovarian cancer detection,
ovarian cancer diagnosis,
disease monitoring,
differential diagnostic,
prognosis track,
distinguishing early stage group patients and/or high risk group patients,
predicting therapy outcome,
risk classification,
or combinations thereof.
3. The use according to any one of claims 1 to 2, wherein the sample is selected from blood, plasma or serum or a mixture thereof.
4. The use according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the mammalian subject is human.
5. The use according to any one of claims 1 to 4, comprising the detection of the presence of the metabolites in said sample and comparing it to a control sample.
6. The use according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the metabolites are measured based on a quantitative analytical method, particularly chromatography, spectroscopy, and mass analyzers/spectrometry .
7. The use according to claim 6, wherein chromatography comprises GC, CE, LC, HPLC, and UHPLC.
8. The use according to claim 6, wherein spectroscopy comprises UV/Vis, IR, NIR and NMR.
9. The use according to claim 6, wherein mass analyzers/spectrometry comprises ESI, Quadrupole Mass Analyzers, Ion Trap Mass Analyzers, TOF (Time of Flight) Mass Analyzer, Orbitrap mass analyzer, Magnetic Sector Mass Analyzer, Electrostatic Sector Mass Analyzer, Ion Cyclotron Resonance (ICR) and combinations thereof, in particular single quadrupole (Q) and triple quadrupole (QqQ), QqTOF, TOF-TOF, Q-Orbitrap, APCI-QqQ, APCI-QqTOF, MAFDIQqQ, MAFDIQqTOF, and M AFDI-T OF-TOF .
10. An in vitro or ex vivo method for the detection, diagnosis, prognosis and/or therapy monitoring of ovarian cancer, comprising the following steps:
(a) providing a sample of a mammalian subject,
(b) determining the amount of a combination of metabolites as defined in claim 1, and
(c) comparing said amount determined in (b) with a control sample.
1 1. The method of claim 10, wherein the sample is selected from blood, plasma, serum.
12. The method according to any one of claims 10 to 11, wherein the mammalian subject is human. 13. The method of claim 10, wherein the metabolites are measured based on a quantitative analytical method,
particularly chromatography, spectroscopy, and mass analyzers/ spectrometry,
wherein chromatography particularly comprises GC, CE, LC, HPLC, and UHPLC;
wherein spectroscopy particularly comprises UV/Vis, IR, NIR and NMR; and
wherein mass analyzers/spectrometry particularly comprises ESI, Quadrupole Mass Analyzers, Ion Trap Mass Analyzers, TOF (Time of Flight) Mass Analyzer, Orbitrap mass analyzer, Magnetic Sector Mass Analyzer, Electrostatic Sector Mass Analyzer, Ion Cyclotron Resonance (ICR) and combinations thereof,
in particular single quadrupole (Q) and triple quadrupole (QqQ), QqTOF, TOF-TOF, Q-Orbitrap, APCI-QqQ, APCI-QqTOF, MAFDI-QqQ, MAFDIQqTOF, and MAFDI-T OF-TOF .
14. A kit for performing the in vitro or ex vivo method for the detection, diagnosis, prognosis and/or therapy monitoring of ovarian cancer according to any one of claims 10 to 13, comprising a device having one or more wells and one or more inserts impregnated with at least one internal standard.
15. The kit of claim 14, further comprising
antibodies that target said metabolites as defined in claim 1.
