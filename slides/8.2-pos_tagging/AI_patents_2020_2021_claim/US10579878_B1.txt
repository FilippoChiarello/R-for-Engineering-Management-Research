12. The method of claim 10, further comprising: generating output data to display the plurality of videos in parallel within a user interface, wherein the user interface includes a navigation bar to visually indicate whether the first video segment of a first video included in the plurality of videos deviates from the template.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying the first surgical step includes a user selecting the first surgical step in the first video included in the plurality of videos.
14. A non-transitory machine readable storage medium having instructions stored thereon, which, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform a method comprising: selecting a plurality of videos from a surgical video database, each including video data of a first surgical procedure comprising a plurality of surgical steps; identifying a first surgical step included in the plurality of surgical steps within a first video segment in each of the plurality of videos, including: receiving the first surgical step in a first video included in the plurality of videos; and selecting, using machine learning logic, the first surgical step in other videos included in the plurality of videos, and wherein the first video is not included in the other videos; warping the first video segment to standardize a dimension of the first video segment in each of the plurality of videos; displaying the first video segment of at least a first video and a second video included in the plurality of videos in parallel, wherein the dimension of the first video segment is standardized by warping at least one of the first video or the second video.
15. The non-transitory machine readable storage medium of claim 14, wherein the dimension includes a temporal dimension that includes a duration of the first video segment, and wherein warping the first video segment further includes: adjusting the duration of the first video segment to provide an equal runtime of the first video segment in each of the plurality of videos.
16. The non-transitory machine readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein each of the plurality of videos includes a first frame rate that corresponds to real-time playback, wherein adjusting the duration of the first video segment includes assigning a second frame rate to the first video segment, and wherein the first frame rate is different than the second frame rate.
17.
