Intelligent personal assistant

<abstract>
A personal assistant device may include a microphone configured to receive an audio command from a user and a processor. The processor may be configured to receive a microphone output signal from the microphone based on the received audio command, receive at least one other microphone output signal from another personal assistant device, and autocorrelate the microphone output signals. The processor may also be configured to determine a reverberation of each of the microphone output signals, determine whether the microphone output signal from the microphone has a lower reverberation than the at least one other microphone output signal, and transmit the microphone output signal to at least one other processor for processing of the audio command in response to the microphone output signal having a lower reverberation than the at least one other microphone output signal.

<claims>
1. A personal assistant device, comprising: a microphone configured to receive an audio command from a user; a processor configured to: receive a microphone output signal from the microphone based on the received audio command; receive at least one other microphone output signal from another personal assistant device; autocorrelate the microphone output signals; determine a reverberation of each of the microphone output signals; determine whether the microphone output signal from the microphone has a lower reverberation than the at least one other microphone output signal; and transmit the microphone output signal to at least one other processor for processing of the audio command in response to the microphone output signal having a lower reverberation than the at least one other microphone output signal.
2. The device of claim 1, wherein the reverberation is determined based at least in part on an energy spread of the autocorrelated signals.
3. The device of claim 2, wherein the reverberation is determined based at least in part on a room impulse response (RIR) of the microphone output signals.
4. The device of claim 2, wherein the processor is further configured to normalize the microphone output signal after the autocorrelation.
5. The device of claim 4, wherein the processor is further configured to identify an average peak of the correlated microphone output signals.
6. The device of claim 5, wherein the reverberation is determined based at least in part on an energy width of the autocorrelated signals with respect to the average peak.
7. The device of claim 5, wherein the autocorrelated signal with the narrowest energy spread about the average peak has the lowest reverberation.
8. A personal assistant device system, comprising: a plurality of personal assistant devices, each including a microphone configured to receive an audible user command; a processor configured to: receive at least one microphone output signal based on the user command from each of the personal assistant devices, autocorrelate the microphone output signals; determine a reverberation of each of the microphone output signals; and determine which of the microphone output signals has the lowest reverberation; and process the microphone output signal having the lowest reverberation.
9. The device of claim 8, wherein the reverberation is determined based at least in part on an energy spread of the microphone output signals.
10. The device of claim 9, wherein the reverberation is determined based at least in part on a room impulse response (RIR) of the microphone output signals.
11. The device of claim 8, wherein the processor is further configured to normalize the microphone output signal after the autocorrelation.
12. The device of claim 8, wherein the processor is further configured to identify an average peak of the correlated microphone output signals.
13. The device of claim 12, wherein the reverberation is determined based at least in part on an energy width of the autocorrelated signals with respect to the average peak.
14. The device of claim 12, wherein the autocorrelated signal with the narrowest energy spread about the average peak has the lowest reverberation.
15. A method comprising: receiving a microphone output signal from a microphone of a personal assistant device based on a received audio command; receiving at least one other microphone output signal from another personal assistant device; autocorrelating the microphone output signals; determining a reverberation of each of the microphone output signals; and determining whether the microphone output signal from the microphone has a lower reverberation than the at least one other microphone output signal; and transmitting the microphone output signal to at least one other processor for processing of the audio command in response to the microphone output signal having a lower reverberation than the at least one other microphone output signal.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the reverberation is determined based at least in part on an energy spread of the autocorrelated signals.
17. The method of claim 15, further comprising normalizing the microphone output signals after the autocorrelation.
18. The method of claim 15, wherein the reverberation is determined based at least in part on a room impulse response (RIR) of the microphone output signals.
19. The method of claim 15, further comprising identifying an average peak of the correlated microphone output signals.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein the reverberation is determined based at least in part on an energy width of the autocorrelated signals with respect to the average peak.
