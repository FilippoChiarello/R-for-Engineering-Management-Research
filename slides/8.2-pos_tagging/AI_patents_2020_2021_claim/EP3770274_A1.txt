<title>
SYSTEMS AND METHODS OF DIAGNOSING IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS ON TRANSBRONCHIAL BIOPSIES USING MACHINE LEARNING AND HIGH DIMENSIONAL TRANSCRIPTIONAL DATA
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention provides systems, methods, and classifiers for differentiating between samples as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or non-UIP.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for determining that a subject is positive for usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or non-usual interstitial pneumonia (non-UIP), comprising: (a) obtaining a biological sample of said subject, (b) assaying nucleic acid molecules derived from said biological sample to identify i) a first level of expression corresponding to one or more genes associated with UIP or non-UIP, and ii) a second level of expression corresponding to one or more genes associated with smoker status bias; and, (c) processing said first level of expression and said second level of expression to generate a classification of said biological sample as being positive for said UIP or said non-UIP.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein said processing comprises applying a machine learning classifier to said first level of expression and said second level of expression.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein said machine learning classifier has been trained on one or more features selected from the group consisting of: gene expression, variants, mutations, fusions, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and biological pathway effect.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein said machine learning classifier has been trained using (i) samples from subjects positive for non-UIP, optionally wherein said samples from said subject positive for non-UIP comprise a heterogeneous spectrum of pathology subtypes of non-UIP optionally comprising hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), sarcoidosis, respiratory bronchiolitis (RB), bronchiolitis and/or organizing pneumonia (OP) and (ii) samples from subjects positive for UIP.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein said trained machine learning classifier weighs said first level of expression and said second level of expression different from one another.
6. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein said processing comprises excluding said second level of expression.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein said biological sample is a biopsy sample or a bronchoalveolar lavage sample.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein said biopsy sample is a surgical lung biopsy sample or a transbronchial biopsy (TBB) sample.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein said biological sample is fresh-frozen or fixed.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein said first level of expression and said second level of expression are determined by RT-PCR, microarray hybridization, RNASeq, or a combination thereof.
11. The method of claim 1, further comprising measuring an additional expression level of at least one control nucleic acid in said biological sample.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein said UIP is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein said non-UIP is selected from the group consisting of: hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), sarcoidosis, bronchiolitis, and organizing pneumonia (OP).
14. The method of claim 1, wherein said classification is generated at a specificity of at least about 90% or a sensitivity of at least about 60%.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein said classification is generated at an accuracy of at least about 85%.
