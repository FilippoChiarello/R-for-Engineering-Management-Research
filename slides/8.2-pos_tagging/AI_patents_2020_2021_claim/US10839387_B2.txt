<title>
Blockchain based action and billing
</title>

<abstract>
A method, computer system, and computer program product are provided for automatically causing an action to be performed and a payment for the action to be made in a blockchain environment. The blockchain environment receives a transaction. The transaction is configured to activate a smart contract. In response to being activated by the transaction, the smart contract issues a message within the blockchain environment. The message causes the action to be performed at a location device and an indication of the payment for the action to be rendered on a display of a device.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for automatically causing an action to be performed and a payment for the action to be made in a blockchain environment, the computer-implemented method comprising: receiving a transaction in the blockchain environment, the transaction configured to activate a smart contract; responsive to being activated by the transaction, issuing, by the smart contract, a message within the blockchain environment, wherein the message causes the action to be performed and an indication of the payment for the action to be rendered on a display of a user device; using an application stored in the user device; selecting a feature; responsive to selecting the feature, sending instructions from the user device to the blockchain environment to configure the smart contract to activate upon reading the transaction, wherein the transaction comprises a user identification, an application identification, and a feature code; sending, from the user device, the transaction to a location device, wherein the location device comprises a full node in the blockchain environment; and responsive to receiving the transaction at the location device, sending the transaction to the blockchain environment.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the action comprises one or more of effecting an admission to a location, billing for the admission, making the payment for the admission, and recording the payment in a blockchain in the blockchain environment.
3. A computer-implemented method for automatically causing an action to be performed and a payment for the action to be made in a blockchain environment, the computer-implemented method comprising: receiving a transaction in the blockchain environment, the transaction configured to activate a smart contract; responsive to being activated by the transaction, issuing, by the smart contract, a message within the blockchain environment, wherein the message causes the action to be performed and an indication of the payment for the action to be rendered on a display of a user device; using an application stored in the user device; selecting a feature; responsive to selecting the feature, sending instructions from the user device to the blockchain environment to configure the smart contract to activate upon reading the transaction, wherein the transaction comprises a user identification, an application identification, and a feature code; connecting the user device to a location device by a wireless connection; and responsive to a user input on the user device, sending the transaction to the blockchain environment by the wireless connection.
4. A computer-implemented method for automatically causing an action to be performed and a payment for the action to be made in a blockchain environment, the computer-implemented method comprising: receiving a transaction in the blockchain environment, the transaction configured to activate a smart contract; responsive to being activated by the transaction, issuing, by the smart contract, a message within the blockchain environment, wherein the message causes the action to be performed and an indication of the payment for the action to be rendered on a display of a user device; using an application stored in the user device; selecting a feature; and responsive to selecting the feature, sending instructions from the user device to the blockchain environment to configure the smart contract to activate upon reading the transaction, wherein the transaction comprises a user identification, an application identification, and a feature code, wherein the user device is a light node in the blockchain environment, and wherein the light node contains only headers for pointing to data in a full node.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 3, wherein sending the transaction to the location device comprises one of scanning a barcode into a barcode reader at the location device and sending the transaction in a wireless transmission to the location device.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 3, further comprising: responsive to storing the application in a storage of the device, creating a light node in the storage of the device and creating a full node in the blockchain environment.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein sending the transaction to the location device comprises one of scanning a barcode into a barcode reader at the location device and sending the transaction in a wireless transmission to the location device.
8. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: responsive to storing the application in a storage of the device, creating a light node in the storage of the device and creating a full node in the blockchain environment.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 3, wherein the action comprises one or more of effecting an admission to a location, billing for the admission, making the payment for the admission, and recording the payment in a blockchain in the blockchain environment.
10. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, wherein the action comprises one or more of effecting an admission to a location, billing for the admission, making the payment for the admission, and recording the payment in a blockchain in the blockchain environment.
11. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, wherein sending instructions from the user device comprises one of scanning a barcode into a barcode reader and sending the transaction in a wireless transmission.
12. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, further comprising: responsive to storing the application in a storage of the device, creating a light node in the storage of the device and creating a full node in the blockchain environment.
