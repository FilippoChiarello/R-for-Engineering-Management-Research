<abstract>
A privacy level for an answer is set according to a person to be answered. The privacy level for an answer includes a privacy level at a time of an answer to the person to be answered. The privacy level indicates a degree to which personal information regarding a user is disclosed. Then, an answer message that answers an utterance of the person to be answered that has been collected with a microphone is generated and output. The answer message corresponds to the privacy level for an answer. The present technology can be applied to, for example, an agent robot that answers instead of a user.
