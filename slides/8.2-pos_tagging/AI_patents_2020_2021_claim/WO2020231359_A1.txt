AUTONOMOUS CONTROL AND LENGTHENING SYSTEM FOR TUMOR PROSTHESIS
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention proposes a bone lengthening system (100) for tumor prostheses, comprising a prosthesis (202) which includes an internal battery (7) arranged for wireless charging; the system (100) further comprises an extendable mechanism (1) which is connected to the prosthesis (202) and which is arranged to be lengthened for, when in use, bringing a length (108) of a limb provided with the prosthesis to a value corresponding to a length of a healthy limb (201) based on a healthy limb length data (107).

<claims>
1. A bone lengthening system (100) for tumor prostheses, comprising a prosthesis (202) which includes an internal battery (7) arranged for wireless charging; the system (100) further comprises an extendable mechanism (1)
which is connected to the prosthesis (202) and
which is arranged to be lengthened via an adjusting means for, when in use, altering a length (108) of a limb provided with the prosthesis (202) based on a healthy limb length (107) data.
2. The system according to the claim 1, wherein said extendable mechanism (1) has a telescopic structure by including coaxially arranged two tubes (12 and 13) which are slidable relative to each other along an extension axis.
3. The system according to the claim 2, wherein the prosthesis (202) is provided with a sensor which is suitable for measuring the length (108) of the limb which is provided with said prosthesis; the sensor being arranged to determine momentary positions of said two tubes (12 and 13) relative to each other and generate a data signal based on said relative positions corresponding to the length (108) of the limb provided with the prosthesis (202).
4. The system according to the claim 3, wherein the prosthesis (202) includes an internal control unit (3) arranged to receive communication of the data signal corresponding to the length (108) of the limb which is provided with said prosthesis; and the system further comprises an external control unit (4) and an external sensor (5) for being externally arranged onto a healthy limb for measuring and tracking a healthy limb length (107) data to be communicated to the external control unit (4).
5. The system according to the claim 4, wherein the internal control unit (3) includes sensors for gathering information on one or more prosthesis (202) - related physical values selected from the list consisting of an extent of lengthening, a temperature, a battery charge level and preferably information on patient posture situation; and the internal control unit (3) is arranged to communicate the information on said one or more prosthesis (202) - related physical values to the external control unit (4); the external control unit (4) being arranged to communicate a command for altering the length (108) of the limb which is provided with said prosthesis, to the internal control unit (3).
6. The system according to any of the claims 4 or 5, wherein the external sensor (5) is arranged to, when approximated to a healthy limb (201), communicate with further sensors corresponding to lower and upper distal ends of the healthy limb (201) to determine the healthy limb length (107) data and then communicate said healthy limb length (107) data to the internal control unit (3) via the external control unit (4).
7. The susyem according to any of the claims 4 to 6, wherein the external control unit (4) is arranged to provide information and guidance to a user for a commencement of the altering of the length (108) of the limb provided with the prosthesis (202).
8. The system according to any of the claims 4 to 7, being arranged to determine a time for altering the lengh (108) of the limb provided with the prosthesis based on the length (107 and 108) data, and to generate a warning signal accordingly; preferably the system being further arranged to communicate the warning signal over a visual and/or audial interface.
9. The system according to the claim 8, being arranged to trigger the altering of the lengh (108) of the limb provided with the prosthesis (202) at a time after the generation of said warning signal.
10. The system according to any of the claims 1 to 9, wherein the extendible mechanism includes an artificial knee joint (11) and one of said tubes (12 or 13) is connectable to a femur, and a portion of the artificial knee joint (11) is connectable to a tibia; the adjusting means comprises a motor (22), a spindle drive (23) and an encoder (24); said motor (22) being arranged to move the two tubes (12 and 13) relative to each other via the spindle drive (23). 11. The system according to any of the claims 4 to 10, comprising a measuring means which include transmitters for being aligned at two distal ends of a bone at a healthy limb of a patient, for measuring a distance between said two distal ends by externally sensing a momentary situation of the measuring means by the external sensor (5), and for then generating the healthy limb length (107) data for being communicated to the external control unit (4).
12. The system according to any of the claims 4 to 11, wherein the external control unit (4) is arranged to specify a difference between the healthy limb length (107) and the lengh (108) of the limb provided with the prosthesis (202).
13. The system according to the claim 12, arranged to guide the patient by commands once the difference is specified to be above a pre-determined value.
14. The system according to any of the claims 1 to 13, wherein the internal battery is disposed inside the prosthesis (202).
