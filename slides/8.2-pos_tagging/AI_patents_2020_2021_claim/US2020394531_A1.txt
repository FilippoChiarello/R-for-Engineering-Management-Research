HANDLING OF DISTRIBUTED LEDGER OBJECTS AMONG TRUSTED AGENTS THROUGH COMPUTATIONAL ARGUMENTATION AND INFERENCE IN THE INTEREST OF THEIR MANAGERS
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for the handling of distributed ledger objects among trusted agents through computational argumentation and inference in the interest of their managers, whereto a trusted agent, the protagonist, after a selection and identification phase, initiates a dialogue with other trusted agents, the antagonists, proposing an argument to justify the acceptance of a claim aiming to obtain the handling of distributed ledger objects in the interest of its manager. The antagonists may or may not decide to be engaged in a negotiation with the protagonist depending on their claims with their given constraints and limits. In the former case they exchange arguments and counterarguments with the other trusted agents involved and through computational argumentation and inference they may agree on the handling of distributed ledger objects by subscribing a contract and performing it in a distributed ledger. Each agent is unequivocally associated to its manager and each agent has a root of trust module allowing an unequivocal identification of it as trusted.
