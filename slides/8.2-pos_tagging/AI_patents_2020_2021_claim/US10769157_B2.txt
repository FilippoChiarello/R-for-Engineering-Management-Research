Method and system for mapping attributes of entities
</title>

<abstract>
This disclosure relates generally to data processing, and more particularly to a system and a method for mapping heterogeneous data sources. For a product being sold globally, there might be one global database listing characteristics of the product, and from various System and method for mapping attributes of entities are disclosed. In an embodiment, the system uses a combination of Supervised Bayesian Model (SBM) and an Unsupervised Textual Similarity (UTS) model for data analysis. A weighted ensemble of the SBM and the UTS is used, wherein the ensemble is weighted based on a confidence measure. The system, by performing data processing, identifies data match between different data sources (a local databases and a corresponding global database) being compared, and based on matching data found, performs mapping between the local databases and the global database.
