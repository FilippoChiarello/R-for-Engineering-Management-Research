METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SIDELINK SIGNALLING IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to sidelink signalling in wireless communications. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a method performed by a first wireless device in a wireless communication system comprises: generating, by an entity of a first radio access technology (RAT), a first signalling message duplicated from a second signalling message; and transmitting the first signalling message on a carrier of the first RAT and the second signalling message on a carrier of a second RAT, wherein the second signalling message is transmitted with information informing that a duplication is performed by the entity of the first RAT, and wherein the entity is an upper entity with respect to a media access control (MAC) entity.

<claims>
1. A method performed by a first wireless device in a wireless communication system, the method comprising: generating, by an entity of a first radio access technology (RAT), a first signalling message duplicated from a second signalling message; and transmitting the first signalling message on a carrier of the first RAT and the second signalling message on a carrier of a second RAT, wherein the second signalling message is transmitted with information informing that a duplication is performed by the entity of the first RAT, and wherein the entity is an upper entity with respect to a media access control (MAC) entity.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the generating of the first signalling message comprises performing the duplication of the second signalling message to obtain the first signalling message duplicated from the second signalling message, and wherein the duplication is performed based on that a single carrier is available for the first RAT and at least one carrier on the second RAT is available for the duplication.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the transmitting of the first signalling message and the signalling message comprises transmitting, to a second wireless device via sidelink, the first signalling message on a carrier of the first RAT and the second signalling message on a carrier of a second RAT, further comprising: receiving, from the second wireless device via sidelink, feedback information for at least one of the first signalling message or the second signalling message; and performing a re-transmission of at least one of the first signalling message or the second signalling message on the carrier of the first RAT, to the second wireless device via sidelink.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the information comprises sidelink control information (SCI) informing that the duplication is performed by the entity of the first RAT.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the second signalling message is included in a MAC protocol data unit (PDU), and wherein the information is included in a header of the MAC PDU.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the information corresponds to a logical channel identity (LCID) field of the header of the MAC PDU, or a version field of the header of the MAC PDU.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the first RAT comprises a new radio (NR), and the second RAT comprises a long-term evolution (LTE).
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the entity comprises a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) entity.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the first signalling message is transmitted with information informing that the duplication is performed on the first RAT and the second RAT.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving, from a second wireless device to which the first signalling message and the second signalling message are transmitted, a first response message for at least one of the first signalling message and the second signalling message on the carrier of the first RAT, and a second response message duplicated from the first response message on the carrier of the second RAT.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the first signalling message and the second signalling message comprise a PC5 request message, and wherein the first response message and the second response message comprise a PC5 response message.
12. The method of claim 10, further comprising: after receiving the first response message and the second response message, performing a sidelink transmission to the second wireless device on the carrier of the first RAT.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the first wireless device is in communication with at least one of a user equipment, a network, and/or autonomous vehicles other than the wireless device.
14. A wireless device in a wireless communication system comprising: a transceiver; a memory; and at least one processor operatively coupled to the transceiver and the memory, and configured to: generate, by an entity of a first radio access technology (RAT), a first signalling message duplicated from a second signalling message, and control the transceiver to transmit the first signalling message on a carrier of the first RAT and the second signalling message on a carrier of a second RAT, wherein the second signalling message is transmitted with information informing that a duplication is performed by the entity of the first RAT, and wherein the entity is an upper entity with respect to a media access control (MAC) entity.
15. A processor for a wireless device in a wireless communication system, wherein the processor is configured to control the wireless device to perform operations comprising: generating, by an entity of a first radio access technology (RAT), a first signalling message duplicated from a second signalling message; and transmitting the first signalling message on a carrier of the first RAT and the second signalling message on a carrier of a second RAT, wherein the second signalling message is transmitted with information informing that a duplication is performed by the entity of the first RAT, and wherein the entity is an upper entity with respect to a media access control (MAC) entity.
