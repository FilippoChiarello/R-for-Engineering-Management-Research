CONFIDENCE MEASURE FOR A DEPLOYED MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
</title>

<abstract>
Presented are concepts for obtaining a confidence measure for a machine learning model. One such concept process input data with the machine learning model to generate a primary result. It also generate a plurality of modified instances of the input data and processes the plurality of modified instances of the input data with the machine learning model to generate a respective plurality of secondary results. A confidence measure relating to the primary result is determined based on the secondary results.

2. The method of claim 1, wherein determining a confidence measure comprises:
determining a measure of distribution or variance of the secondary results; and determining a confidence measure based on the determined measure of distribution or variance.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein determining the measure of distribution or variance of the secondary results comprises determining at least one of:
the inverse variance of the secondary results;
the shannon entropy of the secondary results;
the gini coefficient of the secondary results;
the Kullback-Liebler divergence of the secondary results; and
a concentration measure of the secondary results.
4. The method of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein generating a plurality of modified instances of the input data comprises:
applying a first spatial warping transformation to the input data to generate a first modified instance of the input data.

6. The method of any of claims 1 to 5, wherein generating a plurality of modified instances of the input data comprises:
adding noise to the input data to generate a second modified instance of the input data.
7. The method of any of claims 1 to 6, wherein generating a plurality of modified instances of the input data comprises:
applying a local deformation transformation to the input data to generate a third modified instance of the input data.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising:
applying a first inverse local deformation transformation to the secondary result generated for the third modified instance of the input data.
9. The method of any of claims 1 to 8, wherein the machine learning model comprises at least one of:
an artificial neural network;
a Generative Adversarial Network, GAN; and
a Bayesian network.
10. The method of any of claims 1 to 9, further comprising:
