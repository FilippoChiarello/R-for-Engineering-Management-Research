<title>
ASSEMBLY OF FUNCTIONALLY INTEGRATED HUMAN FOREBRAIN SPHEROIDS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
Human pluripotent stem cells are differentiated in vitro into forebrain subdomain structures, which are then fused to generate an integrated system for use in analysis, screening programs, and the like.
</abstract>

<claims>
That which is claimed is:
1. A method for producing an integrated human forebrain structure in vitro, the method comprising: inducing in a pluripotent stem cell suspension culture a neural fate to provide a spheroid of neural progenitor cells; (i) differentiating the neural progenitor cells in a spheroid to differentiate into cortical spheroids (hCS); (ii) differentiating the neural progenitor cells in a spheroid to differentiate into subpallial spheroids (hCS) culturing the hCS and hSS under conditions permissive for cell fusion while maintaining for an extended period of time in neural medium in the absence of growth factors; wherein an integrated forebrain structure is differentiated comprising interacting GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the human integrated forebrain structure further comprises one or more of glial cells, neuro-epithelial cells, and oligodendrocytes.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the neurons comprise at least one allele associated with a neurologic or psychiatric disorder.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the pluripotent stem cells are induced pluripotent stem cells.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the pluripotent stem cell suspension culture is induced to a neural fate by culturing intact colonies of the pluripotent stem cells in medium comprising an effective dose of an inhibitor of BMP and an inhibitor of TGFÎ².
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the medium comprises a dose of dorsomorphin and SB-431542 effective to induce pluripotent stem cells to a neural fate.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the suspension culture is feeder layer free.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the medium further comprises an effective dose of an inhibitor of wnt and an agonist of smoothened to generate subpallial spheroids.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the medium further comprises one or both of an effective dose of allopregnanolone and retinoic acid
10. The method of claim 1, wherein cells are differentiated into neural progenitors by culture in neural medium comprising a dose of FGF2 and EGF effective to maintain neural progenitor cells.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising differentiating neural progenitors into neurons by culture in neural media lacking FGF2 and EGF, and comprising an effective dose of BDNF and NT3.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising maintaining integrated forebrain structures thus produced for an extended period of time in neural medium lacking growth factors.
13. A population of cells isolated from an integrated forebrain structure produced by the method of claim 1.
14. A method determining the effect of a candidate agent on human neurons, the method comprising: contacting the candidate agent with one or a panel of integrated forebrain structures differentiated from induced human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) according to the method of claim 1, or a population of cells isolated therefrom, wherein the neurons optionally comprise at least one allele encoding a mutation associated with a neural disease; and determining the effect of the agent on morphologic, genetic or functional parameters.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein a panel of integrated forebrain structures comprises at least differing genotypes.
16. The method of claim 14, wherein the effect on saltatory migration is determined.
17. The method of claim 14, wherein the effect on synapse formation is determined.
18. The method of claim 14, wherein the effect on synaptic transmission is determined.
19. An in vitro generated integrated human forebrain structure produced by the method of claim 1.
