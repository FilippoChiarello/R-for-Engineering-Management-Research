</title>

<abstract>
Described herein are therapeutic compositions comprising heparin-associated polypeptides useful for the treatment of soft-tissue and muscle diseases, disorders, and injuries.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A composition comprising: (a) a first recombinant or synthetic polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence with at least about 90% identity to amino acids 19 to 1170 of THBS1 (SEQ ID NO: 9); (b) a second recombinant or synthetic polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence with at least about 90% identity to amino acids 23 to 216 of FGF17 (SEQ ID NO: 7); and (c) a solubilizing, emulsifying, or dispersing agent, wherein the first polypeptide is present in an amount about 1 mg/mL or greater and the second polypeptide is present in an amount about 1 mg/mL or greater.
2. The composition of claim 1, provided that the first recombinant or synthetic polypeptide has been recombinantly produced, the second recombinant or synthetic polypeptide has been recombinantly produced, or both the first and second recombinant or synthetic polypeptides have been recombinantly produced.
3. The composition of claim 1, provided that the first recombinant or synthetic polypeptide has been produced in a mammalian, yeast, insect or bacteria cell, the second recombinant or synthetic polypeptide has been produced in a mammalian, yeast, insect or bacteria cell, or both the first and second recombinant or synthetic polypeptides have been produced in a mammalian, yeast, insect or bacteria cell.
4. The composition of claim 3, provided that the first recombinant or synthetic polypeptide, the second recombinant or synthetic polypeptide, or both the first and the second recombinant or synthetic polypeptides have been produced in a mammalian cell and the mammalian cell is a human cell, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell or mouse myeloma cell.
5. The composition of claim 1, further comprising an IL-15 polypeptide or a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence at least about 90% identical to amino acids 49-162 of SEQ ID NO: 10.
6. The composition of claim 1, further comprising an IGF2 polypeptide or a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence at least about 90% identical to amino acids 25-91 of SEQ ID NO: 11.
7. The composition of claim 1, formulated for administration by injection.
8. The composition of claim 7, provided that the injection is intramuscular injection.
9. The composition of claim 7, provided that the injection is systematic, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection.
10. The composition of claim 1, further comprising a VTN polypeptide or a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence comprising at least about 90% identical to amino acids 20-478 of SEQ ID NO: 1.
11. The composition of claim 1, wherein the first polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence with at least about 95% identity to amino acids 19 to 1170 of THBS1 (SEQ ID NO: 9).
12. The composition of claim 1, wherein the second polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence with at least about 95% identity to amino acids 23 to 216 of FGF17 (SEQ ID NO: 7).
13. The composition of claim 1, wherein the first polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence with at least about 97% identity to amino acids 19 to 1170 of THBS1 (SEQ ID NO: 9).
14. The composition of claim 1, wherein the second polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence with at least about 97% identity to amino acids 23 to 216 of FGF17 (SEQ ID NO: 7).
