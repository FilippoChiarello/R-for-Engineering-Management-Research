<title>
SECURE EXPEDITIONARY AI SENSE-UNDERSTAND-DECIDE-ACT SYSTEM AND METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A method, computer program product, and computer system for applying deductive artificial intelligence (AI) attribution and auditability to data inputs, wherein the deductive AI may account for ontologies and competing system information, and wherein the deductive AI attribution and auditability may be applied to the data inputs by user workflow. The data inputs applied with the deductive AI attribution and auditability may be processed via a feedback loop to align a sense-understand-decide-act (SUDA) understanding with an inductive AI understanding. The inductive AI may be automated via the feedback loop based upon, at least in part, an AI expert system processing of the data inputs. One or more policy based rules may be developed for user automation authorization based upon, at least in part, the feedback loop.

A computer-implemented method comprising: applying, by a computing device, deductive artificial intelligence (AI) attribution and auditability to data inputs, wherein the deductive AI accounts for ontologies and competing system information, and wherein the deductive AI attribution and auditability is applied to the data inputs by user workflow; processing, via a feedback loop, the data inputs applied with the deductive AI attribution and auditability to align a sense-understand-decide-act (SUDA) understanding with an inductive AI understanding; automating, via the feedback loop, the inductive AI based upon, at least in part, an AI expert system processing of the data inputs; and developing one or more policy based rules for user automation authorization based upon, at least in part, the feedback loop.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 wherein processing the data inputs includes indexing the data inputs.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 wherein processing the data inputs includes analyzing the data inputs.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 wherein processing the data inputs includes organizing the data inputs.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 wherein processing the data inputs includes sorting the data inputs.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 wherein the competing system information includes one of cybersecurity threat information and the one or more policy based rules for user automation authorization.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 wherein automating the inductive AI includes automating sensing and understanding functions of the inductive AI and decision and action functions of the deductive AI.
8. A computer program product residing on a computer readable storage medium having a plurality of instructions stored thereon which, when executed across one or more processors, causes at least a portion of the one or more processors to perform operations comprising: applying deductive artificial intelligence (AI) attribution and auditability to data inputs, wherein the deductive AI accounts for ontologies and competing system information, and wherein the deductive AI attribution and auditability is applied to the data inputs by user workflow; processing, via a feedback loop, the data inputs applied with the deductive AI attribution and auditability to align a sense-understand-decide-act (SUDA) understanding with an inductive AI understanding; automating, via the feedback loop, the inductive AI based upon, at least in part, an AI expert system processing of the data inputs; and developing one or more policy based rules for user automation authorization based upon, at least in part, the feedback loop.
9. The computer program product of claim 8 wherein processing the data inputs includes indexing the data inputs.
