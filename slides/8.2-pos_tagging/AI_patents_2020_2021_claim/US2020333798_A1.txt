METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR GENERATING RADAR MAPS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided for generating a map for use in controlling a vehicle. In one embodiment, a method includes: receiving, by a processor, aerial image data depicting an environment; processing, by the processor, the aerial image data with a plurality of trained deep learning models to produce a predicted radar map; and controlling the vehicle based on the predicted radar map.
