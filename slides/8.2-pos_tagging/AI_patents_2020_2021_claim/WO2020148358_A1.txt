<title>
mRNA-BASED BIOMARKERS FOR ANTIBODY-MEDIATED TRANSPLANT REJECTION
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to methods for diagnosing or determining in a subject who underwent a solid organ transplantation the risk of developing graft rejection other than T cell mediated, comprising the steps of: measuring in a peripheral blood sample from said subject the RNA expression levels of a set of genes comprising at least CXCL10, FCGR1A, FCGR1B and TIMP1; determining from the measured expression levels of said set of genes, an expression profile; comparing the determined expression profile of said subject with a reference expression profile; and determining from said comparison, whether said subject is experiencing said rejection or has an increased risk of developing said rejection.

<claims>
1. A method for diagnosing or determining in a subject who underwent a solid organ transplantation the risk of developing graft rejection other than T cell mediated graft rejection, the method comprising the steps of:
- measuring in a peripheral blood sample from said subject the RNA expression levels of a set of genes comprising at least CXCLIO (C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 10), FCGR1A (Fragment Of IgG Receptor la), FCGR1B Fragment Of IgG Receptor lb) and TIMP1 (TIMP Metallopeptidase Inhibitor 1),
- determining, from the measured expression levels of said set of genes, an expression profile,
- comparing the determined expression profile of said subject with a reference expression profile,
- determining from said comparison, whether said subject is experiencing said rejection or has an increased risk of developing said rejection.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the set of genes further comprises one or more of GBP4 (Guanylate Binding Protein 4), KLRC1 (Killer Cell Lectin Like Receptor Cl), GBP1 (Guanylate Binding Protein 1) and IL 15 (Interleukin 15).
3. The method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein measured expression levels are normalised against housekeeping genes.
4. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the graft rejection other than T cell mediated rejection, is selected from the group consisting of antibody mediated rejection, changes suspicious of antibody-mediated rejection, and mixed T cell and antibody mediated rejection.
5. The method according to claim any one claims 1 to 4, wherein the graft rejection other than T cell mediated rejection is an antibody mediated rejection. 6. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the solid organ transplant is a kidney transplant.
7. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein, for the calculation of the expression profile, a weight factor is attributed to the quantitative expression level of each gene, wherein the weight factor of CXCL10<GBP4<KRLC1<FCGR1A and wherein the weight factor GBP1<FCGR1B<IL15<TIMP1.
8. The method according to claim 7, wherein the weight factor of GBP1< CXCL10<GBP4<KRLC1<FCGR1B<IL15<TIMP1 <FCGR1A. 9. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein a linear regression algorithm is used to compare the expression profile of said subject with a reference expression profile.
10. The method according to claim 9, wherein the linear regression algorithm is represented by the formula
log (odds ABMR) = "constant value" + a * ACq_CXCL10 + b * ACq _GBP1 + c * ACq _ IL15 + d * ACq _FCGR1A + e * ACq _FCGR1B + f * ACq _GBP4 + g * ACq _KLRC1+ h* ACq _TIMP1,
wherein a value of log (odds ABMR) above - 0,83 is indicative of rejection other than T cell mediated rejection,
wherein "constant value" is -2,52 ± 0,25, a is -0,25 ± 0,025, b is 0,086 ± 0,0086, c is 0,76 ± 0,076, d is -1,21 ± 0,12, e is + 0,45 ± 0,045 , f is -0,31 ± 0,031 , g -0,40 ± 0,04 and is h is 1,03 ± 0,1,
and wherein ACq of a gene corresponds to the mean delta-Cq of each gene, which is the difference between the measured Cq value of each gene and the mean Cq value of three housekeeping genes.
11. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 10, wherein the RNA expression levels are determined by a quantitative PCR amplification method.
12. A method for distinguishing, in a subject who underwent kidney transplantation, between antibody mediated rejection and T cell mediated rejection, comprising the steps of:
measuring in a peripheral blood sample from said subject the RNA expression level of a set of genes comprising at least CXCL10, FCGR1A FCGR1B and TIMP1,
comparing the measured RNA expression levels of each genes in the set with the RNA expression level of at least one reference housekeeping gene, wherein a high expression level of CXCL10 and FCGR1A compared to the expression level of the least one reference gene, and wherein a low expression level of FCGR1B and TIMP1, compared to the expression level of the least one reference gene, is indicative of antibody mediated rejection.
Use of nucleic acid probes for determining the RNA expression set of genes in detecting the increased risk, development or presence of developing antibody mediated rejection in a subject who underwent kidney transplantation, wherein the set of genes comprises at least CXCLIO, FCGR1A, FCGR1B and TIMP1, and optionally one or more of GBP4, KLRC1, GBP1 and IL 15.
A kit for in vitro diagnosis of kidney rejection other than T cell mediated rejection comprising :
(i) a nucleic acid probe or set of nucleic acid probes, for determining the expression level of at least CXCLIO, FCGR1A FCGR1B and TIMP1, and optionally a nucleic acid probe or set of nucleic acid probes for determining the expression level of GBP4, KLRC1, GBP1 and IL 15, and
(ii) optionally a nucleic acid probe or set of nucleic acid probes for determining the expression level of housekeeping genes,
wherein the kit comprises no more than 50 nucleic acid probess for determining the expression level of a gene that does not belong to the genes of (i) and that is not a housekeeping gene,
or
wherein the kit comprises no more than 50 sets of nucleic acid probes for determining the expression of gene that does not belong to the genes of (i) and that is not a housekeeping gene.
The kit according to claim 14, further comprising instructions for use under the form of a formula for calculating an expression profile, and for calculating the odds of rejection other than T cell mediated rejection.
