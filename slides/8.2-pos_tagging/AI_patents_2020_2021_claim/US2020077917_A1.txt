PORTABLE ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
An electrocardiography device is described that can include a main body, an adjustable cap, and a power switch. The main body can include an electrode of a plurality of electrodes configured to acquire electrical signal from a patient. The adjustable cap can include two electrodes of the plurality of electrodes. The adjustable cap can be rotatable around an axis on the main body to orient the plurality of electrodes on different locations on a body of the patient. The power switch can activate the plurality of electrodes to acquire the electrical signal from the patient. Related apparatuses, systems, methods, techniques and articles are also described.
