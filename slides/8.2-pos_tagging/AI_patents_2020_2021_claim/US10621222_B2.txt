<title>
Fuzzy term partition identification
</title>

<abstract>
A method, computer system, and a computer program product for building and applying fuzzy term partitions is provided. The present invention may include building a fuzzy category taxonomy. The present invention may also include implementing the built fuzzy category taxonomy into a fuzzy category classifier. The present invention may then include building a fuzzy term extractor. The present invention may further include building a fuzzy term association map. The present invention may also include processing a plurality of words stored on a database. The present invention may then include extracting a fuzzy term from the processed plurality of words. The present invention may further include associating the extracted fuzzy term with a plurality of context data. The present invention may also include producing a context data partition for the extracted fuzzy term. The present invention may then include applying a weight to the extracted fuzzy term.

<claims>
1. A method for building and applying fuzzy term partitions, the method comprising: building a fuzzy category taxonomy; building a fuzzy term extractor based on the built fuzzy category taxonomy; associating a fuzzy term with a plurality of context data; producing a context data partition for the associated fuzzy term based on the associated plurality of context data; and applying a weight to the fuzzy term.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving a fuzzy term input; analyzing a usage context for the received fuzzy term input; applying a fuzzy partition value to the received fuzzy term input; applying a contextual relevancy to the received fuzzy term input; and providing an output based on the applied contextual relevancy.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the weight applied to the fuzzy term is based on a level of expertise of a person speaking the fuzzy term or the person typing the fuzzy term.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the context data partition is created for each fuzzy term.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein each fuzzy term has a plurality of context data partitions created for the fuzzy term and associated with the fuzzy term.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein the context data partition contains a set of data, and wherein the set of data is partitioned as a category, the fuzzy term, an attribute, a plurality of context data, and a crisp value.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the crisp value is a specific value or a specific range of values that depict the fuzzy term.
8. A computer system for building and applying fuzzy term partitions, comprising: one or more processors, one or more computer-readable memories, one or more computer-readable tangible storage medium, and program instructions stored on at least one of the one or more tangible storage medium for execution by at least one of the one or more processors via at least one of the one or more memories, wherein the computer system is capable of performing a method comprising: building a fuzzy category taxonomy; building a fuzzy term extractor based on the built fuzzy category taxonomy; associating a fuzzy term with a plurality of context data; producing a context data partition for the associated fuzzy term based on the associated plurality of context data; and applying a weight to the fuzzy term.
9. The computer system of claim 8, further comprising: receiving a fuzzy term input; analyzing a usage context for the received fuzzy term input; applying a fuzzy partition value to the received fuzzy term input; applying a contextual relevancy to the received fuzzy term input; and providing an output based on the applied contextual relevancy.
10. The computer system of claim 8, wherein the weight applied to the fuzzy term is based on a level of expertise of a person speaking the fuzzy term or the person typing the fuzzy term.
11. The computer system of claim 8, wherein the context data partition is created for each fuzzy term.
12. The computer system of claim 11, wherein each fuzzy term has a plurality of context data partitions created for the fuzzy term and associated with the fuzzy term.
13. The computer system of claim 11, wherein the context data partition contains a set of data, and wherein the set of data is partitioned as a category, the fuzzy term, an attribute, a plurality of context data, and a crisp value.
14. The computer system of claim 13, wherein the crisp value is a specific value or a specific range of values that depict the fuzzy term.
15. A computer program product for building and applying fuzzy term partitions, comprising: one or more computer-readable storage media and program instructions stored on at least one of the one or more tangible storage media, the program instructions executable by a processor to cause the processor to perform a method comprising: building a fuzzy category taxonomy; building a fuzzy term extractor based on the built fuzzy category taxonomy; associating a fuzzy term with a plurality of context data; producing a context data partition for the associated fuzzy term based on the associated plurality of context data; and applying a weight to the fuzzy term.
16. The computer program product of claim 15, further comprising: receiving a fuzzy term input; analyzing a usage context for the received fuzzy term input; applying a fuzzy partition value to the received fuzzy term input; applying a contextual relevancy to the received fuzzy term input; and providing an output based on the applied contextual relevancy.
17. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the weight applied to the fuzzy term is based on a level of expertise of a person speaking the fuzzy term or the person typing the fuzzy term.
18. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the context data partition is created for each fuzzy term.
19. The computer program product of claim 18, wherein each fuzzy term has a plurality of context data partitions created for the fuzzy term and associated with the fuzzy term.
20. The computer program product of claim 18, wherein the context data partition contains a set of data, and wherein the set of data is partitioned as a category, the fuzzy term, an attribute, a plurality of context data, and a crisp value.
