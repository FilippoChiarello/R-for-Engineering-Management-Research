SECURITY ARCHITECTURE FOR MACHINE TYPE COMMUNICATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
Various communication systems may benefit from increased security. For example, communication systems that include machine type communications may benefit from improved security and fault detection. A method, in certain embodiments, may include receiving data at an internet of things module in a mobile network from a robot controller. The data includes sensor information from a plurality of machine type communication devices. The method may also include detecting an attack on the mobile network based on the sensor information. In addition, the method may include determining a preventive action to prevent the attack. Further, the method may include sending an indication of the attack to at least one of the robot controller, another robot controller, or another internet of things module. The indication includes the preventive action.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving data at a robot controller from a plurality of machine type communication devices, wherein the data comprises sensor information from the plurality of machine type communication devices; forwarding the received data to an internet of things module in a mobile network, wherein the sensor information is analyzed to detect an attack on the mobile network; receiving at the robot controller an indication of the attack from the internet of things module in the mobile network, wherein the indication comprises a prevention action; and performing the prevention action to prevent the attack.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the receiving of the indication at the robot controller from the internet of things module in the mobile network may be received via an internet of things orchestrator.
3. (canceled)
4. (canceled)
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the received data comprises local security and monitoring data.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein the prevention action comprises a mitigation strategy, wherein the mitigation strategy comprises cancellation of a task, triggering clean-up of malware or malicious content.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein the robot controller is at least one of a base station or a mobile edge computing entity.
8. A method comprising: receiving data at an internet of things module in a mobile network from a robot controller, wherein the data comprises sensor information from a plurality of machine type communication devices; detecting an attack on the mobile network based on the sensor information; determining a preventive action to prevent the attack; and sending an indication of the attack to at least one of the robot controller, another robot controller, or another internet of things module, wherein the indication comprises the preventive action.
9. The method according to claim 8, wherein the indication is sent via an internet of things orchestrator.
10. The method according to claim 8, wherein the internet of things orchestrator or an internet of things application is used to send the indication to the another internet of things module.
11. The method according to claim 8, further comprising: mining the received data from the robot controller at the mobile network, wherein an internet of things module at least labels or classifies the received data.
12. The method according to claim 11, further comprising: determining an anomaly at the internet of things module, wherein the anomaly comprises the indication of the attack.
13. The method according to claim 8, wherein the another internet of things module is located in another mobile network, wherein the another mobile network is operated by a separate service provider.
14. The method according to claims 13, wherein the service provider comprises a mobile network operator or a mobile virtual network operator.
15. The method according to claim 8, wherein the detecting of the attack comprises detection of the attack before the mobile network is infected.
16. (canceled)
17. The method according to claim 8, further comprising: sharing the received data with another mobile network or service provider.
18. The method according to claim 8, wherein the attack comprises at least one of unauthorized access, data loss and resource availability, or data integrity.
19. (canceled)
20. The method according to claim 8, wherein the prevention action comprises preventing authentication of malicious machine type communication device performing the attack.
21. (canceled)
22. An apparatus comprising: at least one processor; and at least one memory including computer program code, wherein the at least one memory and the computer program code are configured to, with the at least one processor, cause the apparatus at least to: receive data at a robot controller from a plurality of machine type communication devices, wherein the data comprises sensor information from the plurality of machine type communication devices; forward the received data to an internet of things module in a mobile network, wherein the sensor information is analyzed to detect an attack on the mobile network; receive at the robot controller an indication of the attack from the internet of things module in the mobile network, wherein the indication comprises a prevention action; and perform the prevention action to prevent the attack.
23. An apparatus comprising: at least one processor; and at least one memory including computer program code, wherein the at least one memory and the computer program code are configured to, with the at least one processor, cause the apparatus at least to: receive data at an internet of things module in a mobile network from a robot controller, wherein the data comprises sensor information from a plurality of machine type communication devices; detect an attack on the mobile network based on the sensor information; determine a preventive action to prevent the attack; and send an indication of the attack to at least one of the robot controller, another robot controller, or another internet of things module, wherein the indication comprises the preventive action.
24. 24.-27. (canceled)
28. A computer program product embodied in a non-transitory computer-readable medium and encoding instructions that, when executed in hardware, perform a process, the process according to claim 1.
29. A computer program product embodied in a non-transitory computer-readable medium and encoding instructions that, when executed in hardware, perform the process according to claim 8.
