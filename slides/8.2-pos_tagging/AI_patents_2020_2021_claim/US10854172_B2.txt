<abstract>
A display system includes a display configured to superimpose an image on a landscape in front of a vehicle and cause the image to be visually recognized by an occupant of the vehicle, a road shape acquirer configured to acquire information indicating a shape of a road around the vehicle, and a display controller configured to change a display aspect of an image regarding a road to be displayed on the display, on the basis of a form of a roundabout including one or both of a shape component and an outer diameter of the roundabout obtained from the information in a case that the roundabout has been determined to be included in the road shape by referring to the information acquired by the road shape acquirer.

<claims>
1. A display system comprising: a display configured to superimpose an image on a landscape in front of a vehicle and cause the image to be visually recognized by an occupant of the vehicle; a road shape acquirer configured to acquire information indicating a shape of a road around the vehicle; and a display controller configured to change a display aspect of an image regarding a road to be displayed on the display, on the basis of a form of a roundabout including one or both of a shape component and an outer diameter of the roundabout obtained from the information in a case that the roundabout has been determined to be included in the road shape by referring to the information acquired by the road shape acquirer.
2. The display system according to claim 1, wherein the display controller causes an arc image associated with a curvature of the road shape of the roundabout to be displayed on the display, and includes, in an image to be displayed on the display, a straight line image associated with a straight line component in a case that the straight line component is included in the road shape of the roundabout.
3. The display system according to claim 2, wherein the display controller changes a length of the straight line image to be displayed on the display, on the basis of a position of the vehicle and a form of the roundabout in a case that the vehicle travels on a road of the straight line component.
4. The display system according to claim 3, wherein in a case that the display controller changes the length of the straight line image to be displayed on the display, the display controller causes an image with a distal end portion of the arc image extending in association with the curvature to be displayed on the display, on the basis of the change in the length of the straight line image.
5. The display system according to claim 2, wherein in a case that the outer diameter of the roundabout is smaller than a predetermined value, the display controller causes an image with a component of a curve included in a distal end portion of the arc image to be displayed on the display, the component of the curve approaching a reference point of the curve in a road width direction as the vehicle turns.
6. The display system according to claim 1, wherein the display controller causes an image regarding an exit of the roundabout to be displayed at a position associated with an image regarding the roundabout.
7. A display control method performed using a computer comprising: acquiring information indicating a shape of a road around a vehicle; and changing a display aspect of an image regarding a road to be displayed on a display, the display superimposing an image on a landscape in front of the vehicle and causing the image to be visually recognized by an occupant of the vehicle, on the basis of a form of a roundabout including one or both of a shape component and an outer diameter of the roundabout obtained from the information in a case that the roundabout has been determined to be included in the road shape by referring to the acquired information.
8. A computer-readable non-transitory storage medium storing a program, the program causing a computer to: acquire information indicating a shape of a road around a vehicle; and change a display aspect of an image regarding a road to be displayed on a display, the display superimposing an image on a landscape in front of the vehicle and causing the image to be visually recognized by an occupant of the vehicle, on the basis of a form of a roundabout including one or both of a shape component and an outer diameter of the roundabout obtained from the information in a case that the roundabout has been determined to be included in the road shape by referring to the acquired information.
