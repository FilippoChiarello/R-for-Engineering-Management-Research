<title>
Methods of Predicting Disorder Progression for Control Arms Within an Experimental Trial
</title>

<abstract>
Methods of performing experimental treatments on a cohort of subjects are provided. A predictive model can be utilized to predict progression of a medical disorder or relevant imaging biomarker. The predicted medical disorder progression can be utilized as a control to determine whether an experimental treatment has an effect on the progression of the medical disorder. In some instances, the enrollment of subjects within a control group for clinical experiment is eliminated or reduced.

<claims>
1. A method of performing an experimental treatment on a cohort of subjects, comprising: capturing or having captured a set of one or more baseline biomedical images from each subject of a cohort of subjects, wherein each subject of the cohort has a medical disorder that is shared among the subjects; for each subject of the cohort, utilizing or having utilized a trained and validated predictive model and the subject's set of baseline biomedical images to predict the progression of the subjects disorder; for each subject of the cohort, administering or having administered an experimental treatment to the subject; for each subject of the cohort, capturing or having captured a set of one or more experimental biomedical images during or at the end of the treatment; and for each subject of the cohort, assessing the ability of the experimental treatment to ameliorate the medical disorder by comparing the data of the captured experimental biomedical images with the data of the predicted disorder progression.
2. The method as in claim 1, wherein the trained and validated predictive model was trained with baseline image data and clinical endpoint data collected from a training cohort of individuals, each individual having the medical disorder.
3. The method as in claim 2, wherein the clinical endpoint data includes biomedical images acquired at the clinical endpoint.
4. The method as in claim 1, wherein the trained and validated predictive model was trained with biomedical image data acquired during the medical disorder progression.
5. The method as in claim 4, wherein the prediction model is further trained with clinical data or genetic data.
6. The method as in claim 1, wherein the trained and validated predictive model has been assessed utilizing baseline biomedical images of an assessment cohort of subjects.
7. The method as in claim 1, wherein the trained and validated predictive model incorporates a deep neural network (DNN), a convolutional neural network (CNN), a kernel ridge regression (KRR), or a gradient-boosted random forest technique.
8. The method as in claim 1, wherein the trained and validated predictive model was trained unsupervised.
9. The method as in claim 1, wherein the trained and validated predictive model was trained utilizing attention that focus the on specific target structures within the baseline biomedical images.
10. The method as in claim 1, wherein the medical disorder is a physical condition, a mental condition, or a risk of a physical or mental condition that deviates from the norm.
11. The method as in claim 1, wherein the collection of predicted disorder progression of each subject of the cohort is utilized as a surrogate for a control arm in a clinical experiment that assesses the ability of the experimental treatment to ameliorate the medical disorder.
12. The method as in claim 11, wherein the results of the predictive model of each subject of the cohort are utilized as an individualized control for the subject using paired statistical tests.
13. The method as in claim 11, wherein the results of the predictive model of each subject are statistically combined together to formulate the control arm.
14. The method as in claim 1, wherein the collection of predicted disorder progression of each subject of the cohort is utilized within a control arm in a clinical experiment that assesses the ability of the experimental treatment to ameliorate the medical disorder, wherein the control arm also includes experimental data of subject receiving a placebo or standard of care alone.
15. The method as in claim 14, wherein the number of subjects within the control arm is less than 50% of the total number of subjects in the clinical experiment.
16. The method as in claim 15, wherein the number of subjects within the control arm is 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, or 45% of the total number of subjects in the clinical experiment.
17. The method as in claim 1, wherein the baseline biomedical images are obtained via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray, fluoroscopic imaging, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound sonography (US), or positron emission tomography (PET).
18. The method as in claim 1, wherein voxels within each of the baseline biomedical images are weighted relative to other voxels within its image.
19. The method as in claim 1, wherein the predictive model predicts a clinical endpoint, at least one biomedical image depicting medical disorder progression, or the presence at least one biomarker indicating medical disorder progression.
20. The method as in claim 1, wherein the treatment is administration of a drug, performing a surgical procedure, implanting a prosthetic implant, or administration of a vaccine.
