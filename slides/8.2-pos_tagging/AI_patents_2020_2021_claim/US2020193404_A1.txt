5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the second identification step is performed by reducing the total number of possible article identities using the information saved in the temporary article list.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the second identification step is performed by accessing the article identities saved in the temporary article list and identifying the article as one of the accessed article identities originally positioned within a predetermined distance from the article carrying device and added to the temporary article list within a predetermined time.
7. (canceled)
8. The method according to claim 4, wherein the sensor arrangement comprises at least two sensors, and wherein the method further comprises determining a measured article signature using each one of said sensors, and independently comparing each measured signatures with at least a subset of the digital reference signatures associated with the respective sensor, and combining the result of the comparison in order to determine a single uniquely identified article.
9. 9.-10. (canceled)
11. The method according to claim 1, further comprising determining a current position of said article carrying device.
12. The method according to claim 11, wherein the article carrying device comprises a unique identification tag and wherein the method further comprises detecting said tag by means of the sensor arrangement, and determining the position of said article carrying device.
13. The method according to claim 1, wherein the method further comprises: weighing the article carrying device to verify that the weight of the articles arranged therein corresponds to the articles in the dynamic list of articles of the registration account associated with said article carrying device.
14. (canceled)
15. An automatic in-store registration system in a store having at least one article containing area, the system comprising: at least one processor; at least one registration account being associated with a moveable unit such as an article carrying device; and a sensor arrangement comprising a plurality of sensors, the sensor arrangement being configured to, in a first identification step, continuously monitor the article containing area and to detect a change in the article containing area and, in response to said detected change, to transmit a first identification signal comprising information relating to one or more possible articles to the processor, and wherein the sensor arrangement is further configured to, in a second identification step, continuously monitor the article carrying device and to detect a change in or near the article carrying device and, in response to said detected change, to transmit a second identification signal comprising information relating to one or more possible articles to the processor; wherein the processor is configured to identify one or more possible articles from the first identification signal and to save said articles to a temporary article list, wherein the processor is further configured to identify one or more possible articles from the second identification signal, to determine a final article by comparing the one or more articles identified from the second identification signal with the articles stored in the dynamic article list, and to add said final article to the registration account.
16. A method for training an in-store registration system configured to identify and register articles in a store having at least one article containing area, said method comprising performing a training sequence in order to improve the accuracy of the identification of articles by: allowing a store attendant to add or remove one or more articles to or from the article containing area, scanning at least one article by a scanning device for identifying the article, registering one or more signatures of each article by means of a sensor arrangement, and adding or updating information relating to signature and the position of each article to the in-store registration system.
17. (canceled)
18. The method according to claim 16, further comprising determining the position of the article by means of the sensor arrangement itself, by associating the article position with a unique code which is scanned together with the article code, and/or by means of a position detecting unit provided at the scanning device.
