REMOVING FALSE ALARMS AT THE BEAMFORMING STAGE FOR SENSING RADARS USING A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
Processor-implemented methods and systems that perform target verification on a spectral response map to remove false alarm detections at the beamforming stage for sensing radars (i.e., prior to performing peak response identification) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) are provided. The processor-implemented methods include: generating a spectral response map from the radar data; and, executing the CNN to determine whether the response map represents a valid target detection and to classify the response map as a false alarm when the response map does not represent a valid target detection. Subsequent to the execution of the CNN, only response maps with valid targets are processed to generated therefrom a direction of arrival (DOA) command.
