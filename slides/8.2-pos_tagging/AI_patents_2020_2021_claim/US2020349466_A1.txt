PROVIDING PERFORMANCE VIEWS ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMANCE OF A MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to systems, methods and computer readable media for evaluating performance of a machine learning system and providing one or more performance views representative of the determined performance. For example, systems disclosed herein may receive or identify performance information including outputs, accuracy data, and feature data associated with a plurality of test instances. In addition, systems disclosed herein may provide one or more performance views via a graphical user interface including graphical elements (e.g., interactive elements) and indications of accuracy data and other performance data with respect to feature clusters associated with select groupings of test instances from the plurality of test instances. The performance views may include interactive features to enable a user to view and intuitively understand performance of the machine learning system with respect to clustered groupings of test instances that share common characteristics.
