<title>
System, method, and computer program for deploying a prepackaged analytic intelligence module for a quote-to-cash application while protecting the privacy of customer data
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure describes a system, method, and computer program for creating and deploying prepackaged, predictive and prescriptive analytics modules for use with a quote-to-cash application. When deployed, the prepackaged analytics modules execute seamlessly, from the user's perspective, with the quote-to-cash application to provide predictions, recommendations, or other data-driven insights at one or more places in the quote-to-cash process. The modules are created by leveraging a pre-defined transactional data model that is native to the quote-to-cash application. A separate instance of the module is created for each customer that deploys a module. A customer's instance of the module is automatically retrained with the customer's own quote-to-cash data during the deployment phase by retrieving customer data matching metadata definitions predefined by the quote-to-cash application. Each of the prepackaged analytics modules is configured to work with at least one custom input attribute of a select data type and data distribution.
