METHOD FOR MONITORING LITHOGRAPHIC APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
A method of determining a parameter of a lithographic apparatus, wherein the method comprises providing first height variation data (602) of a first substrate, providing first performance data (604) of a first substrate, and determining a model (606) based on the first height variation data and the first performance data. The method further comprises obtaining (608) second height variation data of a second substrate, inputting (609) the second height variation data to the model (610), and determining (612) second performance data of the second substrate by running the model. Based on the second performance data, the method determines (614) a parameter of the apparatus.
