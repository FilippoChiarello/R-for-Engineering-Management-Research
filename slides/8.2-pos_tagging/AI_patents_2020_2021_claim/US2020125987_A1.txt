REDUCTION AND/OR MITIGATION OF CROSSTALK IN QUANTUM BIT GATES
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques facilitating reduction and/or mitigation of crosstalk in quantum bit gates of a quantum computing circuit are provided. A system can comprise a memory that stores computer executable components and a processor that executes the computer executable components stored in the memory. The computer executable components can comprise a signal generation component that implements a control sequence that comprises a single pulse type for a first quantum bit and at least a second quantum bit of a quantum circuit. The computer-executable components can also comprise a coordination component that synchronizes a first pulse of a first channel of the first quantum bit and at least a second pulse of at least a second channel of the second quantum bit. The coordination component can simultaneously apply the first pulse to the first quantum bit and at least the second pulse to at least the second quantum bit.
