<title>
Method and device for tracking a device which may have been transferred between persons
</title>

<abstract>
A method of confirming the identity of a person issued a token and to track that person Possession of the token by the same person is confirmed by using sensors in the token which track the movements of the person. A machine learning system is trained to evaluate the sensor data detecting transfer of possession of the token. The state of continuous possession since the token was issued or set to an enabled state is confirmed and the token is tracked. The method of identity confirmation is used in various contexts such as for to control entry to a location, use of a facility or service. It is also useful to determine continuous possession of a weapon to prevent misuse after the weapon is stolen, dropped or lost. Servers, beacons and outside sources of data or inputs to be measured by the sensor can also be used.

<claims>
I claim:
1. A method of confirming identity comprising: (a) providing the first person with a token to signify the selection wherein the token comprises a sensor to measure conditions produced by the movements of the token, a machine learning model trained to identify probable transfer of possession of the token to another person, and an indicator to show a state of the token; (b) setting a state of the token to a first value when the token is provided to the first person; (c) evaluating inputs from the sensor with a machine learning model and setting the state of the token to a second value on the basis of the evaluation when the evaluation determines that possession of the token has probably transferred to a second person; and (d) at least one of recording the state of the token at a plurality of times and transmitting the state of the token at a plurality of times to a server remote from the token.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein: the state of the token is transmitted to the server with information from the sensor.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein: the state of the token is transmitted to the server with the location of the token.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein: the token transmits information selected on the basis of the state of the token to the server.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein: the evaluation uses inputs from both the sensor and from a second sensor away from the token.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein: the evaluation uses inputs both the sensor and a server away from the token.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein: the token transmits outputs of the machine learning model to the server.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein: at least one of inputs to the machine learning model, outputs of the machine learning model, data from the sensor and the location of the token are recorded.
9. A method of confirming identity comprising: (a) selecting a first person to be identified as having received the selection; (b) providing the first person with a token; (c) providing the first person with a sensor to track movements of the token; (d) evaluating data from the sensor with a machine learning model trained to detect probable transfer of the token to a second person based on the data from the sensor; and (e) recording the evaluation.
10. The method of claim 9 wherein: the recording contains information from at least one of inputs to the machine learning model, outputs of the machine learning model and data from the sensor.
11. The method of claim 9 wherein: the recording contains the location of the token at the time of the evaluation.
12. The method of claim 9 wherein: the token transmits the state of the token to a receiver away from the token.
13. The method of claim 9 wherein: the evaluation uses inputs from both the sensor and from a second sensor away from the token.
14. The method of claim 9 wherein: the evaluation uses inputs from both the sensor and a server away from the token.
15. A device to confirm identity of a person comprising: (a) a token to signify eligibility for a privilege; (b) a sensor to measure movements of the token; (c) a processor to evaluate a machine learning model with inputs based on data from the sensor wherein the model is trained to detect probable transfer of the token to a second person and an output of the evaluation is based on the detection of probable transfer of the token to the second person; and (d) at least one of recording the output of the evaluation and transmitting the state of the token to a receiver remote from the token.
16. The device of claim 15 wherein: data gathered at a plurality of times from the sensor is transmitted to the receiver.
17. The device of claim 15 wherein: the location of the token at a plurality of times is transmitted to the receiver.
18. The device of claim 15 wherein: the token transmits outputs of the machine learning model to a receiver away from the token.
19. The device of claim 15 wherein: the token selects inputs to the machine learning model on the basis of previous outputs of the machine learning model.
20. The device of claim 15 wherein: the evaluation uses inputs from both the sensor and from a second sensor away from the token.
