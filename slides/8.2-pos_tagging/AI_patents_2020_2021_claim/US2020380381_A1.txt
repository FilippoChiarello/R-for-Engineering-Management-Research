PUBLIC POLICY RULE ENHANCEMENT OF MACHINE LEARNING/ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SOLUTIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A method includes creating one or more first policy shims to be applied to a ML/AI module, applying the one or more first policy shims to an input or an output of the ML/AI module and executing the ML/AI module on a data set in response to the applying step. The one or more first policy shims includes an input policy shim and an output policy shim and the applying step includes applying the input policy shim to the data set prior to the executing step and applying the output policy shim to an output of the executing step
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising: creating one or more first policy shims to be applied to a module; applying the one or more first policy shims to an input or an output of the module; executing the module on a data set in response to the applying step.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the one or more first policy shims includes an input policy shim and an output policy shim and the applying step comprises applying the input policy shim to the data set prior to the executing step and applying the output policy shim to an output of the executing step.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the module is one of a plurality of nested modules and the creating step includes creating one or more additional policy shims for at least one of the plurality of nested modules and wherein the applying step applies the one or more additional policy shims to the one of the plurality of nested modules and wherein the executing step includes executing the nested modules in response to the applying step.
4. The method of claim 3 wherein additional one or more data sets are inserted into the plurality of nested modules prior to the executing step.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the creating step includes creating one or more substitute policy shims and further comprising overriding the one or more first policy shims and the applying step comprises applying the one or more substitute policy shims instead of the one or more first policy shims.
6. The method of claim 1 further comprising storing the one or more first policy shims in a database and retrieving the stored one or more first policy shims prior to the applying step.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein the one or more first policy shims is a filter configured to act on the dataset.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein the one or more first policy shims is a set of business rules.
9. The method of claim 1 wherein the creating step includes creating one or more substitute policy shims and further comprising overriding the one or more first policy shims and the applying step comprises applying the one or more substitute policy shims instead of the one or more first policy shims and wherein the applying step is initiated by an external input.
10. The method of claim 9 wherein the external input is one of a weather alert and an emergency alert.
11. The method of claim 9 wherein the external input is one or more business rules.
12. The method of claim 1 wherein the module is modified based on the executing step and whereby the one or more policy shims are no longer used.
13. A method comprising: creating a plurality of modules wherein the modules are nested in a two-stage process; creating a policy shim; applying the policy shim after one of the plurality of modules is executed on a data set after a first stage of the two-stage process; selecting a second module from the plurality of modules based on the applying step; executing the second module on an output of the applying step as a second stage of the two-stage process.
14. The method of claim 13 further comprising modifying the policy shim and wherein the second module is changed from the selected second ML/AI module to another of the plurality of the modules based on the applying step.
15. The method of claim 13 wherein the policy shim is one of a filter and a business rule.
16. An apparatus comprising: a policy database configured for storing a plurality of policies; an input-output interface; a processor coupled to the input-output interface wherein the processor is coupled to a memory, the memory having stored thereon executable instructions that when executed by the processor cause the processor to effectuate operations comprising: creating one or more first policy shims from the plurality of policies; deciding which of the one or more first policy shims is to be applied to a module; and applying the one or more first policy shims to an input or an output of the module.
17. The apparatus of claim 16 wherein the operations further comprise creating a substitute policy shim and wherein the input/output interface includes receiving an input from an external source and overriding the one or more first policy shims with the substitute policy shim.
18. The apparatus of claim 17 wherein the substitute policy is a filter or a business rule.
19. The apparatus of claim 16 wherein the operations further comprise creating a safety policy shim and wherein the input/output interface includes receiving an input from an external source and overriding the one or more first policy shims with the safety policy shim.
20. The apparatus of claim 19 wherein the safety policy shim is a filter or a business rule to be applied based on a safety concern.
