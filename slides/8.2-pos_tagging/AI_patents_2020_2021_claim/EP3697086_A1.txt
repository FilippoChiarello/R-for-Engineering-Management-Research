INFORMATION PROCESSING DEVICE, INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
An information processing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present technology includes an acquisition unit and a movement unit. The acquisition unit acquires eye information regarding an eye of a user. The movement unit moves, on the basis of the acquired eye information, at least a part of an image display mechanism that emits and guides image light to the eye of the user. Thus, it is possible to realize high-quality viewing experience for, for example, a user using an HMD or the like. Thus, it is possible to realize high-quality viewing experience for, for example, a user using an HMD or the like.

<claims>
1. An information processing apparatus comprising: an acquisition unit that acquires eye information regarding an eye of a user; and a movement unit that moves, on a basis of the acquired eye information, at least a part of an image display mechanism that emits and guides image light to the eye of the user.
2. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
the image display mechanism has a display that emits the image light and a lens system that guides the image light emitted from the display to the eye of the user, and
the movement unit moves at least one of the display or the lens system.
3. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
the eye information includes an eye image obtained by shooting the eye of the user.
4. The information processing apparatus according to claim 3, wherein
the eye information includes at least one of a shape, a size, a position, an inclination, or an iris pattern of the eye of the user in the eye image.
5. The information processing apparatus according to claim 3, wherein
the image display mechanism is provided in an HMD (Head Mount Display) wearable by the user, and
the eye information includes the eye image obtained by shooting the eye of the user with an imaging mechanism of the HMD.
6. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a storage unit that stores reference eye information representing the eye information obtained when the eye of the user is put in a prescribed state with respect to the image display mechanism, and the movement unit moves at least a part of the image display mechanism on a basis of the acquired eye information and the reference eye information.
7. The information processing apparatus according to claim 6, wherein
the prescribed state includes a state in which a reference image displayed by the image display mechanism is arranged at a prescribed size and a prescribed position with respect to the eye of the user inside the eye image.
8. The information processing apparatus according to claim 6, wherein
the eye information includes an eye image obtained by shooting the eye of the user,
the reference eye information includes a reference eye image obtained by shooting the eye of the user when the eye of the user is put in the prescribed state with respect to the image display mechanism, and
the movement unit moves at least a part of the image display mechanism on a basis of a difference between the eye image and the reference eye image.
9. The information processing apparatus according to claim 8, wherein
the movement unit moves at least a part of the image display mechanism such that a state of the eye of the user with respect to the image display mechanism comes close to the prescribed state.
10. The information processing apparatus according to claim 8, wherein
the movement unit moves at least a part of the image display mechanism such that a state of the eye of the user with respect to the image display mechanism is put in another state different from the prescribed state.
11. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising
a display control unit that controls an image display by the image display mechanism, wherein
the display control unit moves, on a basis of the acquired eye information, a display position of an image displayed by the image display mechanism.
12. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
the movement unit moves at least a part of the image display mechanism on a basis of details of content displayed by the image display mechanism.
13. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
the movement unit moves at least a part of the image display mechanism on a basis of a viewing time of the user.
14. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising
a state acquisition unit that acquires state information regarding a state of the user, wherein
the movement unit moves at least a part of the image display mechanism on a basis of the acquired state information.
15. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
the image display mechanism is provided in an HMD (Head Mount Display) wearable by the user, and
the information processing apparatus further includes a determination unit that determines reliability of a detection result by a biosensor on a basis of a movement amount by the movement unit with respect to at least a part of the image display mechanism.
16. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
the image display mechanism is provided in an HMD (Head Mount Display) wearable by the user, and
the information processing apparatus further includes an attachment state control unit capable of controlling an attachment state of the HMD on a basis of the acquired eye information.
17. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising
a notification unit that notifies the user of prescribed information on a basis of the acquired eye information.
18. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
the eye information includes a left-eye image obtained by shooting a left eye of the user and a right-eye image obtained by shooting a right eye of the user, and
the movement unit moves at least a part of the image display mechanism on a basis of the left-eye image or the right-eye image.
19. An information processing method performed by a computer system, the information processing method comprising: acquiring eye information regarding an eye of a user; and moving, on a basis of the acquired eye information, at least a part of an image display mechanism that emits and guides image light to the eye of the user.
20. A program causing a computer system to perform: a step of acquiring eye information regarding an eye of a user; and a step of moving, on a basis of the acquired eye information, at least a part of an image display mechanism that emits and guides image light to the eye of the user.
