<title>
DETECTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE EXHIBITING DISEASE CELL HETEROGENEITY AND SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR COMMUNICATING TEST RESULTS
</title>

<abstract>
This disclosure provides, among other things, methods for generating and applying therapeutic interventions. The methods involve, for example, (a) sequencing polynucleotides from cancer cells from a subject; (b) identifying and quantifying somatic mutations in the polynucleotides; (c) developing a profile of tumor heterogeneity in the subject indicating the presence and relative quantity of a plurality of the somatic mutations in the polynucleotides, wherein different relative quantities indicates tumor heterogeneity; and (d) determining a therapeutic intervention for a cancer exhibiting the tumor heterogeneity, wherein the therapeutic intervention is effective against a cancer having the profile of tumor heterogeneity determined.

<claims>
1. A method comprising use of a database to identify one or more effective therapeutic interventions for a subject having cancer, wherein the database includes, for each of a plurality of subjects having cancer: (i) tumor genomic testing data, including somatic alterations, collected at two or more time intervals per subject via serial biopsy of cell-free DNA; (ii) one or more therapeutic interventions administered to each of the subjects at one or more times; and (iii) efficacy of the therapeutic interventions.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein identified therapeutic interventions are stratified by efficacy.
3. The method of claim 2 or claim 3, wherein quantitative bounds on predicted therapeutic intervention's efficacy or lack thereof are reported.
4. The method of any one of claims 1-3, wherein the therapeutic interventions use information of predicted tumor genomic evolution or acquired resistance mechanisms in similar subjects in response to treatment.
5. The method of any one of claims 1-4, wherein the plurality of subjects is at least 50, at least 500 or at least 5000 subjects.
6. The method of any one of claims 1-5, wherein relative frequencies of detected genetic variants are used to classify treatment efficacy.
7. The methods of any one of claims 1-6, wherein weight, adverse treatment effects, histological testing, blood testing, radiographic information, prior treatments, and/or cancer type is used to help classify treatment efficacy.
8. The methods of any one of claims 1-7, wherein treatment response per subject is collected and classified quantitatively through additional testing, wherein the additional testing is blood or urine-based testing.
9. The method of any one of claims 1-8, wherein the method comprises classifying effectiveness of treatment using a classification algorithm, such as: (i) linear regression processes, such as multiple linear regression, partial least squares, regression and principal components regression; (ii) binary decision trees, such as recursive partitioning processes such as classification and regression trees; (iii) artificial neural networks such as back propagation networks; (iv) discriminant analyses such as Bayesian classifier or Fischer analysis; (v) logistic classifiers; and/or (vi) support vector classifiers, such as support vector machines.
10. The method of any one of claims 1-9, wherein both germline and somatic alterations are used for determining treatment efficacy.
11. The method of any one of claims 1-10, wherein acquired resistance alterations are inferred from the database when treatments that were effective in the plurality of subjects initially began to fail.
12. The method of any one of claims 1-11, wherein acquired resistance mechanisms are inferred using genomic tumor profiles collected after treatment per subject.
13. The method of any one of claims 1-12, wherein the tumor genomic testing data is DNA sequencing data.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the DNA sequencing data includes polynucleotides mapping to specific loci in the genome that are the subject of interest, and have been isolated for sequencing by sequence capture or site-specific amplification.
15. The method of any one of claims 1-14, wherein the cell free DNA has been tagged or tracked in order to permit subsequent identification and origin of the particular polynucleotide.
