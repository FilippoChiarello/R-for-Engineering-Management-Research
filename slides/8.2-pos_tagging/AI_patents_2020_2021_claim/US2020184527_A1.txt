Systems and Methods for Providing Price Quotes for 3D Objects
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for providing price quotes for 3D objects are described herein. In one embodiment, costs related to generating a 3D object molded from a 3D printer mold may be based on various parameters. The process for generating a price quote may include uploading an initial file to a server and converting that file into a 3D CAD file. The method may also include selecting units, materials, a finish, and/or a quantity of objects to be made. Based on the selections, the server may generate a price quote to produce the one or more objects, and a checkout option may be provided allowing the user to purchase the one or more objects.

<claims>
1. A method for generating a price quote for a 3D object to be molded from a 3D printer, the method comprising: receiving an initial file associated with at least one 3D object to be formed; obtaining a selection of at least one parameter for the at least one 3D object; and generating a price quote based on the at least one parameter and the initial file.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein generating further comprises: generating the price quote based on a 3D Computer Aided Design ("CAD") file associated with the initial file.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein: the 3D CAD file associated with the initial file is the same as the initial file.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: providing a checkout option to purchase the at least one 3D object based on the generated price quote.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: converting the initial file to a 3D CAD file.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein: a server receives the initial file; and a client device transmits the initial file to the server.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the initial file comprises at least one of: an STL file, an IGES file, a STEP file, a Catia file, a Solid Works file, a ProE file, a 3D Studio file, a Rhino file, a JPEG file, and a GIF file.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the initial file comprises a 2D file, the method further comprises: converting the 2D file to a 3D CAD file.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one parameter comprises at least one of: dimensions of the 3D object; a material to form the 3D object; a quantity of the 3D object to be made; and a finish of the 3D object.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein: the initial file comprises metadata; and the metadata comprises at least one of geographical and temporal data.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein generating further comprises: generating an additional price quote for a background to be formed based on the metadata associated with the initial file.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising: storing at least one of the initial file, the at least one selection parameter, and the generated price quote in a database.
13. A method for optimizing price quotes, comprising: receiving an initial file associated with at least one 3D object to be formed; determining, based on the initial file, a design change for the at least one 3D object to be formed; creating a modified version of the initial file comprising the design change; and generating a price quote based on the modified version of the initial file.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein determining further comprises: determining a potential design issue for the at least one 3D object.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein creating further comprises: correcting the potential design issue within the modified version of the initial file by implanting the design change.
16. The method of claim 13, wherein determining further comprises: providing the design change to correct a potential design issue for the at least one 3D object.
17. The method of claim 13, further comprising: selecting at least one option for the at least one 3D object to be formed.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein generating further comprises: generating the price quote based on the modified version of the initial file and the selected at least one option.
19. A method, comprising: receiving a 2D file comprising a 2D image; converting the 2D image into a 3D image; creating a 3D CAD file comprising the 3D image; and generating a price quote for a 3D object to be formed based on the created 3D CAD file.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein receiving further comprises: uploading the 2D file to a server from a client device.
21. The method of claim 19, further comprising: printing the 3D object based on the created 3D CAD file.
22. The method of claim 19, wherein converting further comprises: extracting a surface from the 2D image to be used for creating the 3D image.
23. The method of claim 19, wherein the 2D object comprises a first dimension and a second dimension, converting further comprises: obtaining a selection of a third dimension from a user, the third dimension being used with the first dimension and the second dimension to create the 3D object.
