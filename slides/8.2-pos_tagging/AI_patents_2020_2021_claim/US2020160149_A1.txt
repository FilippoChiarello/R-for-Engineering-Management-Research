<abstract>
A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium has stored therein a program that causes a computer to execute a process including: inputting a first vector value and a second vector value to a first learning model to obtain a first output result, the first vector value corresponding to a subject of text data in which a first relationship between the subject and an object is missing, the second vector value corresponding to mask data generated from the text data by masking the subject and the object; inputting a third vector value and the first vector value to a second learning model to obtain a second output result, the third vector value corresponding to a second relationship to be compensated for the text data; and determining, by using the object, the first output result, and the second output result, whether it is possible for the second relationship to compensate for the text data.
