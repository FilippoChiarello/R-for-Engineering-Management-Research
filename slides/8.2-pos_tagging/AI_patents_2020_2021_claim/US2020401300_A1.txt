<title>
COMPUTER VISION THAT PROVIDES IDENTIFICATION AND QUANTIFICATION OF GROUP FORMATION
</title>

<abstract>
A computer vision system includes a camera that captures a plurality of image frames of a target field of view; a processing unit coupled to the camera, the processing unit is configured to perform accelerated parallel computations in real-time on the plurality of image frames acquired by the camera and relay the outputs of those computations to a database on a set of servers, the database is connected to a web accessible user interface which allows users to view and interact with the data as well as add data and information that is stored in the database and visualized via the interface. The system provides identification and quantification of group formation.

<claims>
1. A computer vision system, comprising: a digital video camera that captures a plurality of image frames of a target field of view; a processing unit coupled to the camera, the processing unit is configured to perform accelerated parallel computations in real-time on the plurality of image frames acquired by the camera and relay the outputs of those computations to a database on a set of servers, the database is connected to a web accessible user interface which allows users to view and interact with the data as well as add data and information that is stored in the database and visualized via the interface; and wherein the system provides identification and quantification of group formation, and identifies dimensions of a space from only a picture and a user input reference marker.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the video feed captured by the camera and relayed to the processing unit for processing and automated analysis is not stored in the system.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the images are processed in real time.
4. (canceled)
5. The system of claim 1, wherein only data extracted from each frame is stored locally and/or relayed to system servers.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the computer vision system provides identification and quantification of group formation and physical proximity of group members relative to each other.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the system creates a model of the conditions of an establishment that is informed by historical data, and runs scenarios of known intervention options through the model to assess intervention options based on their cost, impact, and any other factors of interest to the establishment owner, when current conditions are observed by the system to be of interest or concern, the system generates an intervention recommendation for the establishment that is based on modeled outcomes, when a modeled intervention is employed, the system observes the impact of the intervention on the conditions, and if the observed impact is different than the modeled impact, the system updates the model based on the observed data.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein an observed impact of the intervention is compared with a modeled impact of the action, and then updates the model.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the systems provide for a continual improvement to the model.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is configured to provide a recommendation that is model directed to at least one of: an interest; and concern of the establishment.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is configured to make one or more recommendations to a human.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the system is configured to provide a mechanism by which the human can take the one or more recommendations or other action.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the other action that is modeled to best address a condition of interest to an establishment.
14. The system of claim 1, wherein the system measures at least one: conditions post an intervention; and action, and compares an observed result to the modeled result.
15. The system of claim 1, wherein the system updates a model selected from at least one of: machine learning and artificial intelligence.
16. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is used with at least one establishment selected from: retail; the food industry; and the beverage industry.
17. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is used relative to advertising costs of an establishment.
18. The system of claim 1, wherein the system provides near real time information relative to an establishment's current occupancy and provides information selected from at least one of: the ratio of an establishment's customers to employees; the number of establishment customers compared to establishment inventory; and the number of people who are entering and/or exiting an establishment.
19. The system of claim 1, wherein the system identifies a condition of interest with regard to occupant count, occupant activity, occupant location, occupant ratios, and/or some derivative or combination thereof and generates information summarizing the identified condition.
20. The system of claim 1, wherein the system sends out an alert to an establishment describing the identified condition of interest e.g. that the establishment capacity has dropped below a target capacity.
