SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR EXTENDING REASONING CAPABILITY FOR DATA ANALYTICS IN INTERNET-OF-THINGS (IoT) PLATFORM
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for extending reasoning capability for data analytics in Internet of Things (IoT) platform(s) are provided. Traditional systems and methods for executing IoT analytics tasks suffer as IoT analytics techniques are generated in different programming language platforms, and this leads to a manual intervention or an asynchronous and sequential analysis of IoT analytics task(s). Embodiments of the method disclosed provide for overcoming the limitations faced by the traditional systems and methods by dynamically creating procedural functions from a plurality of programming languages upon determining an absence of pre-defined procedural functions, and extracting, using the dynamically created procedural functions, one or more semantic rules in a real-time, wherein the one or more semantic rules extend a reasoning capability for executing the one or more data analytics tasks in a plurality of IoT platforms.

<claims>
1. A method for extending reasoning capability for data analytics in Internet of Things (IoT) platform, the method comprising: receiving, by one or more hardware processors, a set of information on one or more data analytics tasks to be executed from a plurality of sources (301); determining, by the one or more hardware processors, a presence of one or more pre-defined procedural functions in the set of information for executing the one or more data analytics tasks (302); performing, based upon the determining, one of (303): executing, via a first set semantic rules, the one or more data analytics tasks upon determining the presence of the one or more pre-defined procedural functions in the set of information, wherein the first set semantic rules are extracted using the one or more pre-defined procedural functions; and dynamically creating an another set of procedural functions upon determining an absence of the one or more pre-defined procedural functions in the set of information, wherein the another set of procedural functions comprise integrated procedural functions from a plurality of programming languages, and wherein the dynamically creating comprises: extracting, using the another set of procedural functions, a second set semantic rules in a real-time, wherein the second set of semantic rules extend a reasoning capability for executing the one or more data analytics tasks in a plurality of IoT platforms.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of dynamically creating the another set of procedural functions further comprises assigning, using one or more pre-defined templates, a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to each of the another set of procedural functions to identify one or more functions with an identical name.
3. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of extracting the second set semantic rules comprises generating, using an assigned Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), a semantic rule extension complaint function wrapper for executing the one or more data analytics tasks in the plurality of IoT platforms.
4. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of extracting the second set semantic rules is preceded by generating, using the set of information, a set of scores by mapping a plurality of identical control flow codes from the plurality of programming languages.
5. The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the each of the plurality of identical control flow codes are represented by a vector space representation technique for determining the presence of the one or more pre-defined procedural functions.
6. A system (100) for extending reasoning capability for data analytics in Internet of Things (IoT) platform, the system (100) comprising: a memory (102) storing instructions; one or more communication interfaces (106); and one or more hardware processors (104) coupled to the memory (102) via the one or more communication interfaces (106), wherein the one or more hardware processors (104) are configured by the instructions to: receive a set of information on one or more data analytics tasks to be executed from a plurality of sources; determine a presence of one or more pre-defined procedural functions in the set of information for executing the one or more data analytics tasks; perform, based upon the determining, one of: execute, via a first set semantic rules, the one or more data analytics tasks upon determining the presence of the one or more pre-defined procedural functions in the set of information, wherein the first set semantic rules are extracted using the one or more pre-defined procedural functions; and dynamically create an another set of procedural functions upon determining an absence of the one or more pre-defined procedural functions in the set of information, wherein the another set of procedural functions comprise integrated procedural functions from a plurality of programming languages, and wherein the dynamically creating comprises: extract, using the another set of procedural functions, a second set semantic rules in a real-time, wherein the second set of semantic rules extend a reasoning capability for executing the one or more data analytics tasks in a plurality of IoT platforms.
7. The system (100) as claimed in claim 6, wherein the one or more hardware processors (104) are configured to dynamically create the another set of procedural functions by assigning, using one or more pre-defined templates, a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to each of the another set of procedural functions to identify one or more functions with an identical name.
8. The system (100) as claimed in claim 6, wherein the one or more hardware processors (104) are configured to extract the second set semantic rules by generating, using an assigned Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), a semantic rule extension complaint function wrapper for executing the one or more data analytics tasks in the plurality of IoT platforms.
9. The system (100) as claimed in claim 6, wherein the one or more hardware processors (104) are configured to generate, using the set of information, a set of scores by mapping a plurality of identical control flow codes from the plurality of programming languages for extracting the second set semantic rules.
10. The system (100) as claimed in claim 9, wherein the one or more hardware processors (104) are configured to represent, by a vector space representation technique, the plurality of identical control flow codes for determining the presence of the one or more pre-defined procedural functions.
11. A computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable medium having a computer readable program embodied therein, wherein the computer readable program, when executed on a computing device, causes the computing device to: receive, by one or more hardware processors, a set of information on one or more data analytics tasks to be executed from a plurality of sources (301); determine, by the one or more hardware processors, a presence of one or more pre-defined procedural functions in the set of information for executing the one or more data analytics tasks (302); perform, based upon the determining, one of (303): execute, via a first set semantic rules, the one or more data analytics tasks upon determining the presence of the one or more pre-defined procedural functions in the set of information, wherein the first set semantic rules are extracted using the one or more pre-defined procedural functions; and dynamically create an another set of procedural functions upon determining an absence of the one or more pre-defined procedural functions in the set of information, wherein the another set of procedural functions comprise integrated procedural functions from a plurality of programming languages, and wherein the dynamically creating comprises: extract, using the another set of procedural functions, a second set semantic rules in a real-time, wherein the second set of semantic rules extend a reasoning capability for executing the one or more data analytics tasks in a plurality of IoT platforms.
