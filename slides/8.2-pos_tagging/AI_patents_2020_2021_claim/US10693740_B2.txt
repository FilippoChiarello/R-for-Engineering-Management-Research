<title>
Data transformation of performance statistics and ticket information for network devices for use in machine learning models
</title>

<abstract>
A device may receive one or more data models that have been trained using a first set of values that are in a format capable of being processed by the one or more data models. The first set of values may be associated with a set of historical network performance indicators relating to a set of network devices. The device may receive network data that includes network ticket information and performance statistics for the one or more network devices. The device may determine a set of network performance indicators relating to the one or more network devices. The device may convert the set of network performance indicators into a second set of values that are in the format capable of being processed by the one or more data models. The device may use the second set of values to generate one or more recommendations associated with improving network performance.
