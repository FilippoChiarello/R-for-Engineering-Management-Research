<title>
System and method for filtering excerpt webpages
</title>

<abstract>
A method, computer program product, and computing system device for receiving, on a computing device, a plurality of webpages. At least one webpage may be filtered from the plurality of webpages into at least one set of webpages using a decision tree algorithm. At least one remaining webpage may be filtered from the plurality of webpages into the at least one set of webpages using a supported vector machine (SVM) algorithm.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: receiving, on a computing device, a plurality of webpages; filtering at least one webpage from the plurality of webpages into at least one set of webpages using a decision tree algorithm; and filtering at least one remaining webpage from the plurality of webpages into the at least one set of webpages using a supported vector machine (SVM) algorithm.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: filtering one or more webpages with an unseen hostname from the plurality of webpages into the at least one set of webpages.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: filtering one or more webpages from the plurality of webpages into the at least one set of webpages based upon, at least in part, one or more pre-defined rules.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: filtering one or more webpages from the plurality of webpages into the at least one set of webpages based upon, at least in part, a set of false positive webpages.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: filtering one or more webpages from the plurality of webpages into the at least one set of webpages based upon, at least in part, a set of false negative webpages.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the at least one set of webpages includes a set of normal webpages and a set of excerpt webpages.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein filtering the at least one webpage into the at least one set of webpages using the decision tree algorithm includes one or more of: filtering the at least one webpage into a set of normal webpages based upon, at least in part, a first confidence score, and filtering the at least one webpage into a set of excerpt webpages based upon, at least in part, a second confidence score.
8. A computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable storage medium having a plurality of instructions stored thereon, which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform operations comprising: receiving a plurality of webpages; filtering at least one webpage from the plurality of webpages into at least one set of webpages using a decision tree algorithm; and filtering at least one remaining webpage from the plurality of webpages into the at least one set of webpages using a supported vector machine (SVM) algorithm.
9. The computer program product of claim 8, further comprising instructions for: filtering one or more webpages with an unseen hostname from the plurality of webpages.
10. The computer program product of claim 8, further comprising instructions for: filtering one or more webpages from the plurality of webpages based upon, at least in part, one or more pre-defined rules.
11. The computer program product of claim 8, further comprising instructions for: filtering one or more webpages from the plurality of webpages based upon, at least in part, a set of false positive webpages.
12. The computer program product of claim 8, further comprising instructions for: filtering one or more webpages from the plurality of webpages based upon, at least in part, a set of false negative webpages.
13. The computer program product of claim 8, wherein the at least one set of webpages includes a set of normal webpages and a set of excerpt webpages.
14. The computer program product of claim 8, wherein filtering the at least one webpage into the at least one set of webpages using the decision tree algorithm includes one or more of: filtering the at least one webpage into a set of normal webpages based upon, at least in part, a first confidence score, and filtering the at least one webpage into a set of excerpt webpages based upon, at least in part, a second confidence score.
15. A computing system including one or more processors and one or more memories configured to perform operations comprising: receiving a plurality of webpages; filtering at least one webpage from the plurality of webpages into at least one set of webpages using a decision tree algorithm; and filtering at least one remaining webpage from the plurality of webpages into the at least one set of webpages using a supported vector machine (SVM) algorithm.
16. The computing system of claim 15, wherein the operations further comprise: filtering one or more webpages with an unseen hostname from the plurality of webpages.
17. The computing system of claim 15, wherein the operations further comprise: filtering one or more webpages from the plurality of webpages based upon, at least in part, one or more pre-defined rules.
18. The computing system of claim 15, wherein the operations further comprise: filtering one or more webpages from the plurality of webpages based upon, at least in part, a set of false positive webpages.
19. The computing system of claim 15, wherein the operations further comprise: filtering one or more webpages from the plurality of webpages based upon, at least in part, a set of false negative webpages.
20. The computing system of claim 15, wherein the at least one set of webpages includes a set of normal webpages and a set of excerpt webpages.
