<title>
Apparatus and method for optical tissue detection
</title>

<abstract>
Apparatus for optical tissue detection and discrimination between a tissue of a user and non-tissue materials and method of optical tissue detection and discrimination between a tissue of a user and non-tissue materials are provided. The apparatus for optical tissue detection includes one or more of light sources. The apparatus can further include at least one photodetector. A processor can be operable to determine whether the detected light is from a tissue of a user.

<claims>
1. An apparatus operable to optically detect tissue, the apparatus comprising: at least one light source operable to emit light of at least three wavelengths into a material, at least one of the at least three wavelengths being about 980 nanometers; at least one photodetector operable to detect at least a portion of the light reflected from the material; a non-transitory medium coupled with a processor and storing instructions for determining whether the material is a biological tissue of a subject or a non-tissue material and for launching an activity when the material is the biological tissue; and the processor coupled with the at least one light source and the at least one photodetector, the processor operable to execute the instructions, stored in the non-transitory medium, for: determining whether the material is the biological tissue or the non-tissue material based on the light detected by the at least one photodetector, when the material is the biological tissue, launching the activity, wherein the activity includes the at least one photodetector recording measurements, and the non-transitory medium is operable to store the recorded measurements, and when the material is the non-tissue material, not launching the activity, and initiating an alert by an output device to check placement of the apparatus, wherein the at least one light source emits light at predetermined intervals to determine if the at least one photodetector is proximate to the tissue, and wherein the at least one light source and the at least one photodetector are operable to be enabled by further activation, wherein the further activation includes the processor detecting a movement.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the at least one light source emits light in at least three wavelengths between about 600 nanometers to about 1100 nanometers.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the at least one light source is coupled to an article of clothing that is operable to secure the at least one light source to a body part of the subject.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a transmitter that is operable to transmit the stored measurements to an electronic device.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processor is further operable to determine the subject from a plurality of previously identified subjects based on the detected light.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processor is further operable to filter optical signals that do not correspond to detected light from the tissue of the subject.
7. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the filtered optical signals correspond to light emitted from any one or more of plastics, polymeric materials, fabrics, textiles, non-tissue surfaces, or cellulosic materials.
8. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the at least one light source, the at least one photodetector and the processor are coupled to an article of clothing that comprises one of a strap, sleeve, jacket, wrist strap, glass, hat, cap, helmet or wrap configured for securement to a body part of the subject corresponding to the tissue of the subject.
9. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the at least one light source is a light emitting diode (LED).
10. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the at least one photodetector generates optical tissue data that comprises data which is used by one or both of the processor and a processor of an electronic device to calculate one or more of hydration index, oxygenated hemoglobin concentration, deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration, total hemoglobin concentration, hemoglobin index, hemoglobin concentration index, lactate threshold, and ventilatory threshold.
11. A biometric recognition device, comprising the apparatus of claim 1, wherein the biometric recognition device is configured for detection and identification of different subjects.
12. A system operable to optically detect tissue, the system comprising: a tissue detection device comprising: at least one light source operable to emit light of at least three wavelengths into a material, at least one of the at least three wavelengths being about 980 nanometers; and at least one photodetector operable to detect at least a portion of the light reflected from the material; and an electronic device coupled to the tissue detection device and operable to transmit signals to activate the at least one light source and receive data from the at least one photodetector, the electronic device comprising: a non-transitory medium coupled with a processor and storing instructions for determining whether the material is a biological tissue of a subject or a non-tissue material and for launching an activity when the material is the biological tissue; and the processor coupled with the at least one light source and the at least one photodetector, the processor operable to execute the instructions, stored in the non-transitory medium, for: determining whether the material is the biological tissue or the non-tissue material based on the light detected by the at least one photodetector, when the material is the biological tissue, launching the activity, wherein the activity includes the at least one photodetector recording measurements, and the non-transitory medium is operable to store the recorded measurements, and when the material is the non-tissue material, not launching the activity, and initiating an alert by an output device to check placement of the apparatus, wherein the at least one light source emits light at predetermined intervals to determine if the at least one photodetector is proximate to the tissue, and wherein the at least one light source and the at least one photodetector are operable to be enabled by further activation, wherein the further activation includes the processor detecting a movement.
