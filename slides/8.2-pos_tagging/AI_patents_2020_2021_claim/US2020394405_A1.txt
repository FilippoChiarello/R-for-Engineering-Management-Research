INFORMATION PROCESSING APPARATUS AND INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An information processing apparatus includes an output control unit that controls presentation of internal information that affects behavior of an autonomous operation body, in which the output control unit controls dynamic presentation of the internal information and behavior plan information related to a behavior plan of the autonomous operation body based on the internal information, and the behavior plan information includes information indicating a flow of behavior of the autonomous operation body in time series. Furthermore, provided is an information processing method including, controlling presentation of internal information that affects behavior of an autonomous operation body, in which the controlling presentation further includes controlling dynamic presentation of the internal information and behavior plan information related to a behavior plan of the autonomous operation body based on the internal information, and the behavior plan information includes information indicating a flow of behavior of the autonomous operation body in time series.
