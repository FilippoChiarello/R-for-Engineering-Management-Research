Trend Detection in a Messaging Platform
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for trend detection in a messaging platform. A trend detection model is selected and a time series having a plurality of instances of social data is received, wherein the instances of social data share a countable parameter. A count is made of occurrences of countable parameters in each instance of social data assigned to that bin and a trend detected based at least in part on the trend detection model and on the count for each bin.

4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: for each of a number of bins, counting by the computing device, occurrences of one or more of a countable parameter in each instance of the plurality of instances of social data assigned to that bin; determining, by the computing device and based on a plurality of previous instances of social data that correspond to the countable parameter, an expected count of instances of social data; and determining, by the computing device, an actual count of the one or more instances of social data in the sampled time series of social data, wherein determining the measure of the trend includes determining, by the computing device, a trending score based at least in part on the expected count and the actual count for each bin.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the expected count of instances of social data is based on a time period in a first day, and wherein the actual count of instances of social data is based on the same time period in a second day after the first day.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining, by the computing device, based at least in part on the distance and a scaling parameter, a particular weight characterizing an amount of similarity between the at least one labeled historical time series of social data from the labeled set of historical times series of the social data and the sampled time series of the social data; and determining, by the computing device, a trending value based on a trending score generated using the particular weight.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the trending value comprises a ratio of a first aggregation of weights and a second aggregation of weights, wherein the first aggregation of weights is based on a first plurality of weights, the first plurality of weights based at least in part on at least a first historical time series of social data labeled as trending from the labeled set of historical times series of the social data, wherein the second aggregation of weights is based on a second plurality of weights, the second plurality of weights based at least in part on at least a second historical time series of social data labeled as non-trending from the labeled set of historical times series of the social data, and wherein the particular weight is included in at least one of the first aggregation of weights or the second aggregation of weights.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein each respective instance of social data in the sampled time series of social data indicates at least one of: text of a social media communication, a count of mentions in a social network for the respective event, one or more hashtags of a social media communication, one or more users following the respective event in a social network, one or more friends of a user in a social network associated with the instance of social data, one or more hyperlinks, or a time-dependent quantity that is countable over time.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the model includes a parameter, wherein the parameter modifies at least of: a time difference between a first time that a real-world event occurs and a second time that a detection of the real-world event occurs in the social data; a fraction of identified trends that are not statistical false positives; or a fraction of real-world trends, which are detected by the model that indicates the likelihood of a trend.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the detected trend represents at least one of: a continuing increase in a quantity of instances of social data that correspond to the particular event, wherein the continuing increase follows a prior steady state in the quantity of instances of social data that correspond to the particular event; an increase in the quantity of instances of social data that correspond to the particular event within a first defined time duration, the quantity of instances being greater than a first threshold, wherein the increase follows the prior steady state in the quantity of instances of social data that correspond to the particular event; or an increase in the quantity of instances of social data within a second defined time duration that is greater than a second threshold, followed by a decline in the quantity of instances of social data within the second defined time duration, wherein the increase follows the prior steady state in the quantity of instances of social data that correspond to a particular event.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein selecting the trend detection model includes receiving, from a content provider, an indication of the trend detection model to select; and wherein outputting at least one indication of the detected trend includes transmitting a trend notice and trend data to the content provider.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the trend detection model includes a plurality of trend values distributed over time, wherein each trend value is a function of a count from two or more bins, the count being a number of occurrences of one or more of the countable parameters in each instance of social data assigned to each bin of a number of bins.
