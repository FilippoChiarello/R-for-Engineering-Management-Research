Methods and Systems for Comprehensive Security-Lockdown
</title>

<abstract>
An electronic lock can enter a lockdown mode in response to a lockdown command comprising a mechanical command, e.g. a button or door handle being pressed on the lock in a predefined time-series sequence, or touching the lock in a time-series sequence). Alternatively, an audio or visual command can be issued, e.g. saying certain words or making a hand gesture. The lock may require additional authentication before executing the lockdown command, e.g. recognizing an authorized electronic key. Other embodiments are also provided.

<claims>
1. A system for controlling a plurality of electronic door locks (EDLs), the system being operable to: (a) receive action button (AB) Lockdown signal messages from ABs; (b) for each EDL i, where i is an index identifying the EDL: determine from the AB Lockdown signal messages whether one or more conditions have occurred; and upon determining that the one or more conditions have occurred, send a Lockdown message to the EDL i to cause the EDL i to enter a Lockdown mode.
2. A system of claim 1 wherein, for each EDL i, the one or more conditions are determined using a function of: time information; a set of EDLs each of which comprises an AB that sent an AB Lockdown signal message; a distance between the EDL i and at least one EDL of the set; and a relative weight assigned to at least one AB that sent an AB Lockdown signal message.
3. A system for controlling a plurality of electronic door locks (EDLs), the system being operable to receive action button (AB) Lockdown signal messages from one or more ABs, to determine from the AB Lockdown signal messages a set of EDLs, and to send a Lockdown message to each EDL of the set to cause the EDL to enter a Lockdown mode.
4. A system of claim 3 where at least one AB has a memory that contains a set of messages, with at least one message for each EDL in the set, the messages being pre-generated by a system external to the AB, each message comprising cryptographic information.
5. A system of claim 4 wherein each message is encrypted for being decryptable by a corresponding EDL but not any other of the EDLs.
6. A system of claim 4 wherein each message comprises cryptographic authentication information for authenticating the message by a corresponding EDL.
7. A system of claim 4 wherein at least one message comprises a command for a corresponding EDL to switch from one operating mode to another operating mode.
8. A system of claim 4 where each message comprises temporal validity information verifiable by a corresponding EDL upon receipt of the message to determine whether the message has expired.
9. A system of claim 3, wherein the system comprises one or more Application Software Servers (ASSs) and one or more routers, wherein each router is operable, upon discovery that the router has lost network connectivity with the one or more ASSs, to configure itself into a head-router to operate autonomously, serving and commanding its downstream devices as per business logic and as needed communicating and commanding peer routers to implement the business logic.
10. A system of claim 9, operable in fault resilient distributed lockdown (DL) mode in which the head router, upon receipt of an AB command for a set of EDLs, executes the following operations: (a) communicates an operation command corresponding to the AB command to those EDLs in set that are directly connected (wirelessly or otherwise) to the head router; (b) for each EDL in the set that is not directly connected to the head router, searches for one or more other routers that are candidates for providing connectivity to the EDL, and requests at least one such other router to convey the operation command to the EDL if at least one such other router is found.
11. A system of claim 10 wherein in the DL mode, the head router notifies the AB that issued the AB command of completion of the operation command by each EDL that completes the operation command.
12. A system of claim 3, where the AB is operable to have a direct wireless communication path with any one of said EDLs.
13. A system of claim 12, wherein an EDL is operable to execute an AB command based on at least one of the following conditions: (a) the AB command is received within a configurable timeout period of when an electronic key (Ekey) with access permission to the EDL was last read by the EDL; (b) an estimated distance between the EDL and the AB is less than a configured threshold.
14. An electronic door lock (EDL) configurable to accept action button (AB) command messages only from a set of ABs, the set being definable by an Application Server System (ASS).
15. A system of claim 14 wherein the EDL is configurable to accept command messages from the set of ABs only during scheduled day(s) of week and/or time(s) of day.
16. An EDL of claim 14 wherein the EDL is configurable, when installed in a room having one or more additional EDLs, to receive an AB command message commanding a Lockdown, and in response to send a lockdown signal to the one or more additional EDLs.
17. A system of claim 3, wherein at least one AB is configured to recognize electronic keys of authorized users, and not to issue a command message unless the AB recognizes an electronic key of an authorized user.
18. An EDL of claim 12 wherein the EDL is configured to communicate with the ABs through one or more routers.
19. An Application System Server (ASS) for controlling a plurality of electronic door locks (EDLs), the ASS being operable to send command messages to the EDLs in two or more phases such that: (a) in a first phase, the ASS sends the command messages as addressed to a plurality of routers providing connectivity to the EDLs but not to the EDLs, for each router to convey the commands to one or more of the EDLs connected to the router; (b) in a second phase, the ASS sends the commands as addressed to the EDLs.
20. An ASS of claim 19 in combination with the one or more routers, wherein in the first phase each router conveys the commands to the respective one or more of the EDLs via a broadcast transmission.
