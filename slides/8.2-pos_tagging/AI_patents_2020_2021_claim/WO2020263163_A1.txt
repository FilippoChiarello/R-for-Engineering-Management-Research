</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing for harvesting of forest using an un-manned vehicle (100) configured to move under the canopy in a forest region, the method comprising: for each of at least one object (110) within the forest region: - obtaining, using at least one sensor (120) of the un-manned vehicle (100), information associated with the object (110); - assigning an object identity (ID) to the object (110) based on the obtained sensor information, using processing circuitry (210) comprised in or accessible to the un-manned vehicle (100); and10 - associating a marker (130) with the object (110) and the obtained sensor information or the object identity (ID) assigned to the object (110). The invention also relates to an un-manned vehicle, a harvesting system and a non- transitory computer-readable storage medium.
