Methods and systems for B2B demand generation with targeted advertising campaigns and lead profile optimization based on target audience feedback
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are methods and systems for generating targeted advertising campaigns for a business-to-business (B2B) company. The method comprises first retrieving an ideal customer profile (ICP), and generating candidates leads that match the ICP. Next, generating test campaigns, scoring each test campaign based on a number of acquired leads and a campaign cost per lead (CPL), where the number of acquired leads is calculated based on feedback information received from each test campaign, and where each test lead who responds affirmatively to one of the test campaigns is marked as an acquired lead, and generating a targeted advertising campaign to a larger subset of the candidate leads based on the test campaign scores. The present invention utilizes a closed-loop approach to customize campaign audiences, to optimize targeted advertising campaigns and ICPs, and as a result, to produces high-quality, low-cost, targeted advertising campaigns for B2B companies.
