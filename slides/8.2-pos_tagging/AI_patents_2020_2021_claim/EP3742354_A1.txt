INFORMATION PROCESSING APPARATUS, INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
Each of a plurality of operation means enters, to a model representing a neural network and including a common first weight, first data different from that used by the other operation means, calculates an error gradient for the first weight, and integrates the gradients calculated by each operation means. Each operation means stores the first weight in storage means and updates the weight of the model to a second weight based on a hyperparameter value different from those used by the other operation means, the integrated error gradient, and the first weight. Each operation means enters common second data to the model, compares the evaluation results acquired by each operation means, and selects a common hyperparameter value. Each operation means updates the weight of the model to a third weight based on the selected hyperparameter value, the integrated error gradient, and the first weight stored in the storage means.
