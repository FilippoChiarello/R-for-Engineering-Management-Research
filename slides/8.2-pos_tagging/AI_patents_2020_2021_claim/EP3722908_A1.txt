<title>
LEARNING A SCENARIO-BASED DISTRIBUTION OF HUMAN DRIVING BEHAVIOR FOR REALISTIC SIMULATION MODEL
</title>

<abstract>
An system 100 for determining a computer model of realistic driving behavior comprises one or more environmental sensors 110, which are configured to provide sensor data of observed vehicles 140-1 and 140-2 within a traffic area 150. A processor 120 is configured to extract observed vehicle behavior data from the sensor data and to extract driving behavior training data 310 from observed vehicle behavior data of vehicles interacting with each other within the traffic area 150. The system 100 is further using a machine learning based driving behavior simulator 130, which is configured to adjust driving behavior model parameters 320. The driving behavior model parameters 320 can be determined by reducing a deviation between the driving behavior training data 310 and simulated vehicle behavior data 340, which is generated by the machine learning based driving behavior simulator 130.
