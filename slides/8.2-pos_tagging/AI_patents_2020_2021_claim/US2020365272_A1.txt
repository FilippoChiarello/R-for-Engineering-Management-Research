MEDICAL INFORMATION PROCESSING APPARATUS, MEDIUM, AND MEDICAL INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A medical information processing apparatus according to an embodiment includes a processing circuitry. The processing circuitry is configured: to receive an input of first transition data indicating a transition up to the present time of a biological index value exhibiting a condition of a patient and second transition data indicating a transition up to the present time of a treatment means implemented on the patient; to set a goal value of the biological index value as a treatment index value; and to predict a time at which the biological index value of the patient will reach the treatment index value, on the basis of such first transition data and second transition data of one or more past patients different from the patient that have characteristics similar to characteristics of the first transition data and the second transition data of the patient.

<claims>
1. A medical information processing apparatus comprising a processing circuitry configured: to receive an input of first transition data indicating a transition up to a present time of a biological index value exhibiting a condition of a patient and second transition data indicating a transition up to the present time of a treatment means implemented on the patient; to set a goal value of the biological index value as a treatment index value; and to predict a time at which the biological index value of the patient will reach the treatment index value, on a basis of such first transition data and second transition data of one or more past patients different from the patient that have characteristics similar to characteristics of the first transition data and the second transition data of the patient.
2. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein, when the first transition data of the patient is updated, the processing circuitry predicts the time on a basis of a characteristic of the updated first transition data.
3. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein, when a future treatment means for the patient is input, the processing circuitry predicts the time on a basis of a characteristic of the second transition data of the patient including the future treatment means.
4. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein by referring to a database storing therein first transition data and second transition data of each of past patients, the processing circuitry extracts first transition data having a characteristic similar to the characteristic of the first transition data of the patient, from first transition data of one or more of the past patients having a characteristic similar to the characteristic of the second transition data of the patient, and the processing circuitry predicts the time on a basis of the extracted first transition data.
5. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry predicts the time on a basis of a future transition of the first transition data of the patient obtained by inputting the first transition data and the second transition data of the patient to a trained model created by using the first transition data and the second transition data of the one or more past patients and configured to receive an input of first transition data and second transition data and to output a future transition of the first transition data.
6. The medical information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein when a specific time is designated, the processing circuitry predicts the time for each of treatment means having mutually-different conditions, and the processing circuitry outputs one of the conditions of the treatment means that satisfies the specific time, from among the predicted times.
