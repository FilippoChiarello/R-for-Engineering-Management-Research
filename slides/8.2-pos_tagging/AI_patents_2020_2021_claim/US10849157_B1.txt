RANDOM ACCESS TRIGGER FRAME BASED UPLINK OFDMA SCHEDULING MECHANISM
</title>

<abstract>
A method for scheduling a random access trigger frame (RA TF) in a wireless LAN includes determining whether a scheduled access (SA) TF is scheduled during a beacon interval (BI) beginning with a next beacon; determining whether one of, a first weighted average of a sum of (i) a number of clients whose respective buffer status reports (BSRs) have been successfully received (NSUCC) and (ii) a number of clients whose respective BSRs collided with one another (NCOL) is greater than a first threshold, or a second weighted average of an active number of UL OFDMA enabled HE users sending SU uplink traffic (NSU) is greater than the first threshold; when either weighted average is greater than the first threshold, allocating a predetermined number of RA RUs along with at least one SA RU in a buffer status report poll (BSRP) TF and scheduling the BSRP TF for transmission.

6. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one SA RU in the buffer status report poll (BSRP) TF is used to detect collisions with a RA BSRP TF transmission.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining whether a number of clients whose respective BSRs collided with one another (NCOL) is greater than a second threshold, and when NCOL is greater than the second threshold, scheduling another BSRP TF to collect uplink data from previously collided users.
