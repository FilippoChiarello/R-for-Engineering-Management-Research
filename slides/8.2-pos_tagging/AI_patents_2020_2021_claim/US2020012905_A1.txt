<title>
LABEL CONSISTENCY FOR IMAGE ANALYSIS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and techniques are disclosed for labeling objects within an image. The objects may be labeled by selecting an option from a plurality of options such that each option is a potential label for the object. An option may have an option score associated with. Additionally, a relation score may be calculated for a first option and a second option corresponding to a second object in an image. The relation score may be based on a frequency, probability, or observance corresponding to the co-occurrence of text associated with the first option and the second option in a text corpus such as the World Wide Web. An option may be selected as a label for an object based on a global score calculated based at least on an option score and relation score associated with the option.

<claims>
1. (canceled)
2. A computer implemented method comprising: receiving, by the computer, a first option for a first object in an image from a first plurality of options; receiving, by the computer, a second option for the first object in the image from a first plurality of options; receiving, by the computer, a control label for a second object in the image; generating a first relation score between the first option and the control label based on a co-occurrence model; generating, by the computer, a second relation score between the second option and the control label based on the co-occurrence model; determining that the first relation score exceeds the second relation score; and designating the first option as a label for the first object in the image.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the co-occurrence model is a machine learning model trained using a text corpus.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein generating the first relation score further comprises, determining the probability that text associated with the first option and the control option co-occur within a text corpus.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein generating the first relation score further comprises applying the co-occurrence model to the first option and the control option wherein the co-occurrence model is generated based at least on co-occurrence within a limit selected from the group consisting of: adjacent words or terms, a same sentence, a same paragraph, a same page, and a same document.
6. The method of claim 3, wherein the text corpus is a portion of the World Wide Web.
7. The method of claim 2, wherein the first option is generated using a label generator.
8. The method of claim 2, further comprising: receiving a search query; identifying the first image based on the label for the first object as a result for the query; and providing the first image based on the identification.
9. The method of claim 2, further comprising designating the first option as a label for the first object based on a regularization factor.
10. A system comprising: a processor configured to: receive a first option for a first object in an image from a first plurality of options; receive a second option for the first object in the image from a first plurality of options; receive a control label for a second object in the image; generate a first relation score between the first option and the control label based on a co-occurrence model; generate, by the computer, a second relation score between the second option and the control label based on the co-occurrence model; determine that the first relation score exceeds the second relation score; and designate the first option as a label for the first object in the image.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the co-occurrence model is a machine learning model trained using a text corpus.
12. The system of claim 10, wherein generating the first relation score further comprises, determining the probability that text associated with the first option and the control option co-occur within a text corpus.
13. The system of claim 10, further configured to: receive a search query; identify the first image based on the label for the first object as a result for the query; and provide the first image based on the identification.
14. A device comprising: a storage; and a processor configured to: receive a first option for a first object in an image from a first plurality of options; receive a second option for the first object in the image from a first plurality of options; receive a control label for a second object in the image; generate a first relation score between the first option and the control label based on a co-occurrence model; generate, by the computer, a second relation score between the second option and the control label based on the co-occurrence model; determine that the first relation score exceeds the second relation score; and designate the first option as a label for the first object in the image.
15. The device of claim 14, wherein the co-occurrence model is a machine learning model trained using a text corpus.
16. The device of claim 14, wherein generating the first relation score further comprises, determining the probability that text associated with the first option and the control option co-occur within a text corpus.
17. The device of claim 14, further configured to: receive a search query; identify the first image based on the label for the first object as a result for the query; and provide the first image based on the identification.
