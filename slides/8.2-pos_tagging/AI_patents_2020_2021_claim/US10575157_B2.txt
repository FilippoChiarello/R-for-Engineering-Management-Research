<title>
Resource control for network devices
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems for managing power consumption of network devices are disclosed. An example method can comprise detecting a triggering condition and reducing functionality of a network device based on detecting the triggering condition. The method can comprise detecting, at the network device, a user device, restoring functionality of the network device in response to detecting the user device, and transmitting information to the user device after restoring functionality of the network device.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: determining, by a network device, timing information associated with reduced functionality of the network device, wherein the timing information is indicative of a time window during which only transmissions that do not satisfy a priority threshold are expected to be received by the network device; sending, to a user device, the timing information; reducing functionality of a first transceiver of the network device during the time window; receiving, from the user device via a second transceiver of the network device and during the time window, a transmission, wherein the network device is configured to communicate via the second transceiver during the time window; restoring functionality of the first transceiver after the time window; and sending, to the user device via the first transceiver, information.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the network device is further configured to one or more of send data to other devices or receive data from the other devices during the time window.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising disconnecting, during the time window, at least a portion of the network device from a power source.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising reconnecting, after the first time window, the at least a portion of the network device to the power source.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the timing information comprises determining that transmissions associated with the user device do not satisfy the priority threshold.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the timing information comprises determining a schedule for conserving power.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the timing information comprises receiving, from another device, an instruction to conserve power.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the time window is determined based on an activity history wherein the activity history comprises a history of at least one of communication, processing, power level, or functionality level associated with the network device.
9. A method comprising: determining, by a network device, that a current time is within a time window associated with reduced functionality of the network device, wherein the time window is based on timing information comprising a time during which transmissions associated with a user device do not satisfy a priority threshold; reducing, based on the current time being within the time window, functionality of a first transceiver of the network device; receiving, from the user device via a second transceiver of the network device, a signal, wherein the network device is configured to communicate via the second transceiver during the time window; restoring, based on the signal, functionality of the transceiver; and sending, to the user device via the first transceiver, information.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising reducing, based on the time window, a number of transmissions associated with a third transceiver of the network device.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the signal comprises a probe request configured to determine a presence of the network device.
12. The method of claim 9, further comprising receiving, after the time window, a quantity of transmissions associated with the first transceiver.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein the network device is further configured to one or more of send data to other network devices via the second transceiver or receive data from the other network devices via the second transceiver.
14. The method of claim 9, wherein the time window is further based on an instruction from another network device to conserve power.
15. An apparatus comprising: one or more processors; and memory storing processor executable instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the apparatus to: determine timing information associated with reduced functionality of the apparatus, wherein the timing information is indicative of a time window during which only transmissions that do not satisfy a priority threshold are expected to be received by a network device, reduce functionality of a first transceiver during the time window, and restore functionality of the first transceiver after the time window; the first transceiver, in communication with the one or more processors, configured to, send the timing information to a user device, and send information to the user device after the time window; and a second transceiver, in communication with the one or more processors, configured to, receive a transmission from another user device during the time window.
16. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the time window comprises a time when a device associated with the apparatus is configured for reduced functionality.
17. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the processor executable instructions, when executed by the one or more processors, further cause the apparatus to disconnect, based on the time window, at least a portion of the apparatus from a power source.
18. The apparatus of claim 17, wherein the processor executable instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the apparatus to disconnect the at least a portion of the apparatus from the power source, further cause the apparatus to reconnect the at least a portion of the apparatus to the power source.
19. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the processor executable instructions, when executed by the one or more processors, further cause the apparatus to determine a schedule for conserving power, wherein the time window is further based on the schedule for conserving power.
20. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the processor executable instructions, when executed by the one or more processors, further cause the apparatus to receive an instruction to conserve power, wherein the time window is further based on the instruction.
