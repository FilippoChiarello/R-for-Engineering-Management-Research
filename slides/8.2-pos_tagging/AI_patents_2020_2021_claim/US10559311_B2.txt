<title>
Speaker diarization with cluster transfer
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, computer program products, and systems are presented. The methods include, for instance: obtaining the media file with a speech and identifying speakers on clusters separated by disfluencies and change of speakers. Clusters are re-segmented rearranged during diarization. Speaker identifications for the clusters in the media file is produced.

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method for diarizing a media file, comprising: obtaining, by one or more processor, the media file having a speech by one or more speaker; stratifying the media file in order into a plurality of sessions at points of respective disfluencies in the speech; initializing one or more cluster space including one or more cluster, wherein the one or more cluster space respectively corresponds to the one or more speaker, wherein the one or more cluster results from identifying respective speaker of a predetermined number of session from the plurality of sessions; generating a cluster by identifying a speaker of a next session; determining a cluster action for the cluster based on a cluster epicenter of the cluster by use of deep learning; performing the cluster action from the determining on the one or more cluster space; bootstrapping the one or more cluster space resulting from the performing; generating another cluster by identifying speaker corresponding to another session from rest of the sessions; and producing speaker identifications respective to each cluster from the generating, responsive to ascertaining that one of exit criteria has been detected, wherein the method includes applying a first set of clusters to a machine learning structure for learning by the machine learning structure, the machine learning structure for use in returning cluster actions, wherein the first set of clusters are for a certain speaker and define a cluster space for the certain speaker, the certain speaker being identified by the identifying a speaker of a next session, wherein the method includes applying a second set of clusters to the machine learning structure for learning by the machine learning structure, wherein the applying the second set of clusters to the machine learning structure is performed after the performing the cluster action, wherein the second set of clusters are differentiated from the first set of clusters, wherein a differentiation between the second set of clusters and the first set of clusters is in dependence on the performing the cluster action, wherein the cluster action is a Removal action that changes boundaries between clusters, wherein according to the Removal action a certain cluster is removed based on the certain cluster not including discernible speech.
2. The computer implemented method of claim 1, the stratifying comprising: ascertaining that the media file includes a disfluency longer than a preconfigured threshold disfluency length; and segmenting the media file into a first segment that precedes the disfluency and a second segment that succeeds the disfluency, by setting respective beginning timestamps and ending timestamps accordingly.
3. The computer implemented method of claim 1, the initializing comprising: obtaining the one or more cluster space based on previous speaker identifications and cluster epicenters respectively associated with speakers by transfer learning and/or by reinforcement learning.
4. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein a subsequent cluster action is selected from the group consisting of Merge, Split, Removal, and Maintain, based on at least one of the following selected from the group consisting of a speaker identity of a cluster, respective speaker identities of immediately consecutive clusters, and fluctuation in values for a cluster epicenter, and combinations thereof.
5. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein a cluster epicenter corresponds to either a speaker or a cluster, wherein the cluster epicenter indicates a manner of speech either by the speaker or represented in the cluster, and wherein the cluster epicenter includes average values of accent, pronunciation, articulation, roughness, nasality, pitch, volume, and speed.
6. The computer implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: discovering a disfluency from a session while executing the generating another cluster; and determining another cluster action for the session based on a cluster epicenter of the session by use of deep learning.
7. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the speaker identifications respective to each cluster includes a beginning timestamp of a cluster, an ending timestamp of the cluster, a transcript of the cluster, a speaker identity of the cluster, and a confidence in the speaker identity in a probabilistic value.
8. A computer program product comprising: a computer readable storage medium readable by one or more processor and storing instructions for execution by the one or more processor for performing a method for diarizing a media file, comprising: obtaining the media file having a speech by one or more speaker; stratifying the media file in order into a plurality of sessions at points of respective disfluencies in the speech; initializing one or more cluster space including one or more cluster, wherein the one or more cluster space respectively corresponds to the one or more speaker, wherein the one or more cluster results from identifying respective speaker of a predetermined number of session from the plurality of sessions; generating a cluster by identifying a speaker of a next session; determining a cluster action for the cluster based on a cluster epicenter of the cluster by use of deep learning; performing the cluster action from the determining on the one or more cluster space; bootstrapping the one or more cluster space resulting from the performing; generating another cluster by identifying speaker corresponding to another session from rest of the sessions; and producing speaker identifications respective to each cluster from the generating, responsive to ascertaining that one of exit criteria has been detected, wherein the method includes applying a first set of clusters to a machine learning structure for learning by the machine learning structure, the machine learning structure for use in returning cluster actions, wherein the first set of clusters are for a certain speaker and define a cluster space for the certain speaker, the certain speaker being identified by the identifying a speaker of a next session, wherein the method includes applying a second set of clusters to the machine learning structure for learning by the machine learning structure, wherein the applying the second set of clusters to the machine learning structure is performed after the performing the cluster action, wherein the second set of clusters are differentiated from the first set of clusters, wherein a differentiation between the second set of clusters and the first set of clusters is in dependence on the performing the cluster action, wherein the cluster action is a Removal action that changes boundaries between clusters, wherein according to the Removal action a certain cluster is removed based on the certain cluster not including discernible speech.
