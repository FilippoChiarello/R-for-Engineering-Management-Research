SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PREDICTIVE ROUTING TO PERSONALIZED BOTS
</title>

<abstract>
A collection of bots is provided that can support predictive routing through mapping customers to the bots. The variety of bot personalities may be provided in a plurality of dimensions such as: utterances used for recognition training, intents supported, and the responses the bot provides. A bot can be trained on collected utterances that are segmented by predictive routing. Human agents who have been classified can be used to segment utterance training so that a specific bot instantiation is trained on utterances typical of a customer who prefers that agent classification. Supported intents can be reflective of the utterance training for the specific classification of an agent. The responses of the bot can also be tailored to the personality typical of the age classification. Each bot response can be syntactically different in a conversation based on the bot segmentation.

<claims>
1. A system for routing an interaction with a customer to a first chat bot of a plurality of chat bots associated with a contact center environment, based on criteria for automatic handling in the contact center environment, comprising: a processor; and a memory in communication with the processor, the memory storing instructions that, when executed by the processor, causes the processor to route the interaction to the first chat bot by: analyzing a plurality of dimensions of historical interactions associated with a profile of the customer to obtain one or more differentiators for the interaction; comparing the one or more differentiators against the differentiators associated with each chat bot of the plurality of chat bots; selecting the first chat bot that is a best match from the plurality of chat bots; and routing the interaction to the first chat bot for handling.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein each of the plurality of chat bots has a distinct persona constructed from a plurality of dimensions associated with agent personalities in the contact center environment.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein an agent personality is associated with a cluster of similar agents for the contact center environment.
4. The system of claim 2, wherein the plurality of dimensions comprises one or more of: utterances for training a bot's recognition, intents a bot supports, and responses an agent provides.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of dimensions comprises one or more of: utterances, intents, and customer responses.
6. A method for routing an interaction to a chat bot from a plurality of chat bots based on criteria for automatic handling in a contact center environment, comprising: analyzing a plurality of dimensions of historical interactions associated with a profile of the customer to obtain one or more differentiators for the interaction; comparing the one or more differentiators against the differentiators associated with each chat bot of the plurality of chat bots; selecting a first chat bot that is a best match from the plurality of chat bots; routing the interaction to the first chat bot for handling; monitoring the interaction for changes, wherein the changes indicate the first chat bot is not a best match; comparing the one or more differentiators against the differentiators associated with each chat bot of the plurality of chat bots; selecting a second chat bot that is a best match from the plurality of chat bots; and routing the interaction to the second chat bot for handling.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the method further comprises: continuing to monitor the interaction for changes, wherein the changes indicate the second chat bot is not a best match; comparing the one or more differentiators against the differentiators associated with each chat bot of the plurality of chat bots; selecting an other chat bot that is a best match from the plurality of chat bots; and routing the interaction to the second chat bot for handling.
8. The method of claim 6, wherein each of the plurality of chat bots has a distinct persona constructed from a plurality of dimensions associated with agent personalities in the contact center environment.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein an agent personality is associated with a cluster of similar agents for the contact center environment.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the plurality of dimensions comprises one or more of: utterances for training a bot's recognition, intents a bot supports, and responses an agent provides.
11. The method of claim 6, wherein the plurality of dimensions comprises one or more of: utterances, intents, and customer responses.
12. A system for routing an interaction with a customer to a first chat bot of a plurality of chat bots associated with a contact center environment, wherein, it is identified that a first chat bot does not meet a threshold for routing and a new chat bot is needed, based on criteria for automatic handling in the contact center environment, comprising: a processor; and a memory in communication with the processor, the memory storing instructions that, when executed by the processor, causes the processor to route the interaction to the first chat bot by: analyzing a plurality of dimensions of historical interactions associated with a profile of the customer to obtain one or more differentiators for the interaction; comparing the one or more differentiators against the differentiators associated with each chat bot of the plurality of chat bots; selecting the first chat bot that is a best match from the plurality of chat bots; determining that the first chat bot does not meet a performance threshold for the differentiators compared to a similar persona of agents in the contact center environment; and creating a notification that a new chat bot is needed.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the notification comprises data on new differentiators needed for the new chat bot to address the new persona.
14. The system of claim 12, wherein the plurality of dimensions comprises one or more of: utterances for training a bot's recognition, intents a bot supports, responses an agent provides, and responses a customer provides.
