<title>
System and method of data management and comparison
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method can be provided to facilitate the comparison of different data sets associated with different organizations. A first data set belonging to a first organization and a second data set belonging to a second organization can be provided. Permissions can be set such that users associated with the first organization cannot view the data contained in the second data set and vice versa. The data sets can be compared based on selected data categories to generate a third data set of match results. The comparison can comprise the use of fuzzy logic. Unmatched data can be excluded from the third data set to protect sensitive data of each organization. The third data set can then be shared between the first and second organization.

<claims>
1. A method for managing data comparison and sharing, the method comprising the steps of: receiving at least one first data set, each first data set comprising at least one first data category, the first data set being associated with a first organization, the first organization associated with at least one first user; assigning a name to each of the at least one first data category of each first data set; receiving at least one second data set, each second data set comprising at least one second data category, the second data set being associated with a second organization the second organization associated with at least one second user; assigning a name to each of the at least one second data category of each second data set; restricting access to the at least one first data set to the at least one first user and restricting access to the at least one second data set to the at least one second user; selecting at least one first data category and selecting at least one second data category: comparing the at least one first data set with the at least one second data set based on the selected at least one first data category and the selected at least one second data category, the comparison using fuzzy logic; generating at least one third data set comprising results of the comparison of the at least one first data set with the at least one second data set based on the selected at least one first data category and the selected at least one second data category; and sharing the at least one third data set with at least one of the at least one first user or the at least one second user.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein unmatched data from the comparison of the at least one first data set with the at least one second data set based on the selected at least one first data category and the selected at least one second data category step is excluded from the at least one third data set.
3. The method according to claim 1, further comprising the step of comparing a subset of the at least one first data set with a subset of the at least one second data set based on the selected at least one first data category and the selected at least one second data category using fuzzy logic.
4. A system for managing data comparison and sharing, the system comprising: a computing device configured to: receive at least one first data set, each first data set comprising at least one first data category, the first data set being associated with a first organization, the first organization associated with at least one first user; assign a name to each of the at least one first data category of each first data set; receive at least one second data set, each second data set comprising at least one second data category, the second data set being associated with a second organization the second organization associated with at least one second user; assign a name to each of the at least one second data category of each second data set; restrict access to the at least one first data set to the at least one first user and restricting access to the at least one second data set to the at least one second user; select at least one first data category and selecting at least one second data category; compare the at least one first data set with the at least one second data set based on the selected at least one first data category and the selected at least one second data category, the comparison using fuzzy logic; generate at least one third data set comprising results of the comparison of the at least one first data set with the at least one second data set based on the selected at least one first data category and the selected at least one second data category; and share the at least one third data set with at least one of the at least one first user or the at least one second user.
5. The system according to claim 4, wherein unmatched data from the comparison of the at least one first data set with the at least one second data set based on the selected at least one first data category and the selected at least one second data category step is excluded from the at least one third data set.
6. The system according to claim 4, wherein the computing device is further configured to compare a subset of the at least one first data set with a subset of the at least one second data set based on the selected at least one first data category and the selected at least one second data category using fuzzy logic.
