<title>
METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR GENERATING OPTICAL SPECTRA
</title>

<abstract>
A method of generating an optical spectrum for a target object using a hand-held computing device such as a smartphone. The target is illuminated with a plurality of different colours of light one at a time in succession using the device's display. The device's video camera simultaneously records the corresponding sequence of coloured light reflected from the target object. Frame images are extracted from the digital video and a respective spectral value for the optical spectrum is calculated from a selected pixel from each frame image. A spectrometry system uses the optical spectrum to classify the target object using a subsumption-based classification technique and known reference spectra.
