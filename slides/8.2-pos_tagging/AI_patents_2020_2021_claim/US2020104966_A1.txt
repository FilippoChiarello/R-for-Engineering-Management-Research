<title>
INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
Transportation systems have artificial intelligence including neural networks for recognition and classification of objects and behavior including natural language processing and computer vision systems. The transportation systems involve sets of complex chemical processes, mechanical systems, and interactions with behaviors of operators. System-level interactions and behaviors are classified, predicted and optimized using neural networks and other artificial intelligence systems through selective deployment, as well as hybrids and combinations of the artificial intelligence systems, neural networks, expert systems, cognitive systems, genetic algorithms and deep learning.

<claims>
1. A method of negotiation-based vehicle routing comprising: facilitating a negotiation of a route-adjustment value for a plurality of parameters used by a vehicle routing system to route at least one vehicle in a set of vehicles; and determining a parameter in the plurality of parameters for optimizing at least one outcome based on the negotiation.
2. The method of claim 1 further comprising capturing, through a vehicle-based route negotiation interface, a set of user-indicated values for the plurality of parameters used by the vehicle routing system to route the at least one vehicle in the set of vehicles.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein a user is a rider of the at least one vehicle.
4. The method of claim 2 wherein a user is an administrator for a set of roadways to be used by the at least one vehicle in the set of vehicles.
5. The method of claim 2 wherein a user is an administrator for a fleet of vehicles including the set of vehicles.
6. The method of claim 1 further comprising offering a set of offered user-indicated values for the plurality of parameters to users with respect to the set of vehicles.
7. The method of claim 6 wherein the route-adjustment value is based at least in part on the set of offered user-indicated values.
8. The method of claim 6 wherein the route-adjustment value is further based on at least one user response to the offering.
9. The method of claim 6 further comprising monitoring responses by the users of the set of vehicles to the set of offered user-indicated values.
10. The method of claim 6 wherein the route-adjustment value is based at least in part on the set of offered user-indicated values and at least one response thereto by at least one user of the set of vehicles.
11. The method of claim 6 wherein the determined parameter facilitates adjusting a route of at least one of the vehicles in the set of vehicles.
12. The method of claim 6 wherein adjusting the route includes prioritizing the determined parameter for use by the vehicle routing system.
13. The method of claim 6 wherein the facilitating negotiation includes facilitating negotiation of a price of a service.
14. The method of claim 6 wherein the facilitating negotiation includes facilitating negotiation of a price of fuel.
15. The method of claim 6 wherein the facilitating negotiation includes facilitating negotiation of a price of recharging.
16. The method of claim 6 wherein the facilitating negotiation includes facilitating negotiation of a reward for taking a routing action.
