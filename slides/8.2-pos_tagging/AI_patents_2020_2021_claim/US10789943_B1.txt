<title>
Proxy for selective use of human and artificial intelligence in a natural language understanding system
</title>

<abstract>
An interactive response system combines human intelligence (HI) subsystems with artificial intelligence (AI) subsystems to facilitate overall capability of multi-channel user interfaces. The system permits imperfect AI subsystems to nonetheless lessen the burden on HI subsystems. A combined AI and HI proxy is used to implement an interactive omnichannel system, and the proxy dynamically determines how many AI and HI subsystems are to perform recognition for any particular utterance, based on factors such as confidence thresholds of the AI recognition and availability of HI resources. Furthermore the system uses information from prior recognitions to automatically build, test, predict confidence, and maintain AI models and HI models for system recognition improvements.
