<title>
SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PRICE OPTIMIZATION OF STAY ACCOMMODATION RESERVATIONS USING BROAD AND DYNAMIC ANALYSES
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for dynamic pricing of short-term stay accommodations, using machine learning algorithms to set pricing based on a broad set of non-homogenous dynamic data that may affect pricing at the time of booking, including pricing of competitors, market forecasts of pricing, internal factors including room quality, customer behavior related to booking, environmental factors, events, and economic factors.

<claims>
1. A system for price optimization of stay accommodation reservations using broad and dynamic analyses, comprising: a property management engine, comprising at least a plurality of programming instructions stored in the memory of, and operating on at least one processor of, a computer system, wherein the plurality of programming instructions, when operating on the processor, cause the computer system to: receive and store real time information about properties, room availability, and reservations made; and send the real time information about properties, room availability, and reservations made to a price optimizing engine; and a price optimizing engine, comprising at least a plurality of programming instructions stored in the memory of, and operating on at least one processor of, a computer system, wherein the plurality of programming instructions, when operating on the processor, cause the computer system to: obtain a plurality of real time pricing information for short-term stay accommodations; obtain a plurality of data about external factors, both current and future, that might affect demand for short-term stay accommodations; dynamically set pricing for short-term stay accommodations based on the plurality of pricing information and the plurality of data about external factors, using machine learning algorithms; and send pricing and availability information to a booking engine; and a reservation management engine comprising at least a plurality of programming instructions stored in the memory of, and operating on at least one processor of, a computer system, wherein the plurality of programming instructions, when operating on the processor, cause the computer system to: receive pricing and availability information from the price optimizing engine; display the pricing and availability information to potential purchasers or their agents; allow purchasers or their agents to make short-term stay accommodation reservations based on the displayed pricing and availability information; and send the reservation information to the property management engine.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of real time pricing information comprises: price and occupancy information for the property at which a reservation is being considered; price and occupancy information for similar properties owned by competitors; and market forecasts of price and occupancy.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of data about external factors comprises: data about customer behavior surrounding the booking decision; data about actual booking, payment, and length of stay by the customer; data about environmental factors that may affect bookings; data about events that may affect bookings; and data about economic factors that may affect bookings.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein a marketplace simulator may be used to simulate a range of marketplace variables, given a single or plurality of optimized pricing options for a parent hotel, wherein the optimized pricing options are refined further based on the outcome of the marketplace simulator.
5. A method for price optimization of stay accommodation reservations using broad and dynamic analyses, comprising the steps of: receiving and storing information about properties including room availability and current reservations in a given hotel, using a property management engine; sending real-time information about properties, pricing, and other hotel information, to a price optimization engine; receiving from either a database or some other network-connected source of digital information, real-time information about accommodations and reservations in a hotel, into a price optimization engine; receiving from either a database or some other network-connected source of digital information, information about external factors including hotel reviews or inclement weather, that may affect short-term hotel stays, into a price optimization engine; use machine learning algorithms to dynamically determine optimal pricing for short-term stay accommodations in a hotel based on received external and hotel data; sending optimal pricing for short-term stay accommodations to a reservation management engine; displaying pricing and availability information to potential purchasers or their agents using a reservation management engine; allowing purchasers or their agents to make short-term stay accommodation reservations based on the displayed pricing and availability information; and sending the reservation information from the reservation management engine to the property management engine.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the plurality of real time pricing information comprises: price and occupancy information for the property at which a reservation is being considered; price and occupancy information for similar properties owned by competitors; and market forecasts of price and occupancy.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein the plurality of data about external factors comprises: data about customer behavior surrounding the booking decision; data about actual booking, payment, and length of stay by the customer; data about environmental factors that may affect bookings; data about events that may affect bookings; and data about economic factors that may affect bookings.
8. The method of claim 5, wherein a marketplace simulator may be used to simulate a range of marketplace variables, given a single or plurality of optimized pricing options for a parent hotel, wherein the optimized pricing options are refined further based on the outcome of the marketplace simulator.
