PRIVACY PRESERVING ORACLE
</title>

<abstract>
Certain aspects of the present disclosure provide techniques for performing computations on encrypted data. One example method generally includes obtaining, at a computing device, encrypted data, wherein the encrypted data is encrypted using fully homomorphic encryption and performing at least one computation on the encrypted data while the encrypted data remains encrypted. The method further includes identifying a clear data operation to perform on the encrypted data and transmitting, from the computing device to a server, a request to perform the clear data operation on the encrypted data, wherein the request includes the encrypted data. The method further includes receiving, at the computing device in response to the request, encrypted output from the server, wherein the encrypted output is of the same size and the same format for all encrypted data transmitted to the server.

<claims>
1. A method for performing computations on encrypted data, comprising: obtaining, at a computing device, encrypted data, wherein the encrypted data is encrypted using fully homomorphic encryption; performing at least one computation on the encrypted data while the encrypted data remains encrypted; identifying a clear data operation to perform on the encrypted data; transmitting, from the computing device to a server, a request to perform the clear data operation on the encrypted data, wherein the request includes the encrypted data; and receiving, at the computing device in response to the request, encrypted output from the server, wherein the encrypted output is of the same size and the same format for all encrypted data transmitted to the server.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein, identifying the clear data operation to perform on the encrypted data comprises determining that performing the clear data operation on the computing device exceeds a computation threshold.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein, identifying the clear data operation to perform on the encrypted data comprises determining that performing the clear data operation on the computing device exceeds a noise threshold.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the clear data operation is a null value.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the encrypted output comprises re-encrypted data, wherein the re-encrypted data comprises the encrypted data with fresh randomness.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the computing device executes at least one machine learning model.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the at least one machine learning model is a tree-based model.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the server is a representational state transfer (REST) server available via hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).
9. A computing device including: a processor; and a memory including computer readable instructions, wherein the processor is configured to, based on execution of the computer readable instructions: obtain, at a computing device, encrypted data, wherein the encrypted data is encrypted using fully homomorphic encryption; perform at least one computation on the encrypted data while the encrypted data remains encrypted; identify a clear data operation to perform on the encrypted data; transmit, from the computing device to a server, a request to perform the clear data operation on the encrypted data, wherein the request includes the encrypted data; and receive, at the computing device in response to the request, encrypted output from the server, wherein the encrypted output is of the same size and the same format for all encrypted data transmitted to the server.
10. The computing device of claim 9, wherein, the processor is further configured to: while identifying the clear data operation to perform on the encrypted data, determine that performing the clear data operation on the computing device exceeds a computation threshold.
11. The computing device of claim 9, wherein, the processor is further configured to: while identifying the clear data operation to perform on the encrypted data, determine that performing the clear data operation on the computing device exceeds a noise threshold.
12. The computing device of claim 9, wherein the clear data operation is a null value.
13. The computing device of claim 12, wherein the encrypted output comprises, re-encrypted data, wherein the re-encrypted data comprises the encrypted data with fresh randomness.
14. The computing device of claim 8, wherein the computing device executes at least one machine learning model.
15. The computing device of claim 14, wherein the at least one machine learning model is a tree-based model.
16. The computing device of claim 9, wherein the server is a representational state transfer (REST) server available via hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).
17. A method for performing computations for a machine learning device by a privacy preserving server, comprising: receiving a request from the machine learning device to perform a clear data operation over encrypted data, wherein the encrypted data is encrypted using fully homomorphic encryption; decrypting the encrypted data to produce clear data; performing the clear data operation on the clear data to produce clear output; deleting the clear data; encrypting the clear output to produce the encrypted output; deleting the clear output; and transmitting, in response to the request, the encrypted output to the machine learning device.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the clear data operation is a null value.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the encrypted output comprises, re-encrypted data, wherein the re-encrypted data comprises the encrypted data with fresh randomness.
20. The method of claim 17, the privacy preserving server is a representational state transfer (REST) server available to the machine learning device via hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).
