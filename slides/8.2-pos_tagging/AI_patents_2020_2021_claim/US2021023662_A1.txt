METHOD AND ROBOTIC ASSEMBLY FOR PERFORMING OPERATIONS ON A TARGET WORKPIECE
</title>

<abstract>
A method for performing operations on a target workpiece including taking an operating tool unit by an industrial robot, carrying the tool unit to the workpiece, releasing the tool unit at the workpiece, moving the robot away from the tool unit, performing one or more operations on the workpiece through the tool unit while the tool unit moves with the workpiece; and retrieving the tool unit from the workpiece after the tool unit has performed the one or more operations on the workpiece. A robotic assembly for performing a method including at least one industrial robot, at least one operating tool unit, and a quick tool changer for detachably coupling the tool unit with the industrial robot including a first tool changer part arranged in the industrial robot and a second tool changer part arranged in the operating tool unit.

<claims>
1. A method for performing operations on a target workpiece, the method comprising: taking an operating tool unit by an industrial robot; carrying the operating tool unit to the target workpiece; releasing the operating tool unit in a suitable position at the target workpiece; moving the industrial robot away from the operating tool unit; performing one or more operations on the target workpiece through the operating tool unit; and retrieving the operating tool unit from the target workpiece after the operating tool unit has performed said one or more operations on the target workpiece.
2. The method of claim 1, further including performing the one or more operations on the target workpiece through the operating tool unit while the operating tool unit moves with the target workpiece.
3. The method of claim 1, further including performing the carrying of the operating tool unit to the target workpiece by referring to a position of a mechanical feature selected from one or more of holes, recesses, protrusions, and clamps.
4. The method of claim 1, the carrying of the operating tool unit to the target workpiece comprising docking the operating tool unit to the target workpiece.
5. The method of claim 4, the performing of the docking of the operating tool unit to the target workpiece is by one or more of mechanical, magnetic, or vacuum systems.
6. The method of claim 1, the retrieving of the operating tool unit from the target workpiece includes connecting the same or another industrial robot to the operating tool unit and releasing the operating tool unit from the target workpiece.
7. The method of claim 1, the taking of an operating tool unit by the industrial robot further comprises moving the industrial robot towards the target workpiece and docking the operating tool unit to it.
8. The method of claim 7, the moving of the industrial robot towards the target workpiece involves reaching a desired suitable positioning through one or more of visual technology and compliance technology.
9. The method of claim 2, further including performing the carrying of the operating tool unit to the target workpiece by referring to a position of a mechanical feature selected from one or more of holes, recesses, protrusions, and clamps.
10. The method of claim 2, the carrying of the operating tool unit to the target workpiece comprises docking the operating tool unit to the target workpiece.
11. The method of claim 2, the retrieving of the operating tool unit from the target workpiece includes connecting the same or another industrial robot to the operating tool unit and releasing the operating tool unit from the target workpiece.
12. The method of claim 2, the taking of an operating tool unit by the industrial robot comprises moving the industrial robot towards the target workpiece and docking the operating tool unit to it.
13. A robotic assembly for performing operations on a target workpiece according to a method as claimed in claim 1, the robotic assembly comprising at least one industrial robot, at least one operating tool unit, and a quick tool changer for detachably coupling the operating tool unit with the industrial robot, the quick tool changer comprising a first tool changer part arranged in the industrial robot and a second tool changer part arranged in the operating tool unit, the operating tool unit including a standalone driving mechanism for performing one or more operations on a target workpiece after the operating tool unit has been detached from the industrial robot allowing the industrial robot to move away from the operating tool unit.
14. The robotic assembly of claim 13, the operating tool unit including a standalone power source for operating the driving mechanism.
15. The robotic assembly of claim 13, further comprising a base tool unit for coupling different operating tool elements.
16. The robotic assembly of claim 13, the industrial robot being configured such that different operating tool units can be attached to or retrieved from the target workpiece.
17. The robotic assembly of claim 13, the quick tool changer being configured such that different operating tool units can be retrieved from the target workpiece, one after the other.
18. The robotic assembly of claim 13, the operating tool unit being configured to perform at least one operation like screwing, riveting, trimming, clipping, and assembling.
19. The robotic assembly of claim 13, the industrial robot being configured to pick components through the operating tool unit before performing operations on a target workpiece.
20. The robotic assembly of claim 13, the operating tool unit being a secondary industrial robot.
