<title>
EFFICIENT CORPUS SEARCH AND ANNOTATION MANAGEMENT FOR A QUESTION ANSWERING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A computer converts a question received in a natural language format into a string of text elements. The computer searches a corpus comprising unstructured passages with the string of the text elements as search terms to identify a selection of unstructured passages from the corpus relevant to the text elements. The computer annotates the selection of relevant unstructured passages with one or more annotations according to at least one natural language annotation type to generate an annotated selection knowledge base. The computer modifies the string of text elements by annotating at least one of the text elements according to the at least one natural language annotation type. The computer searches the annotated selection knowledge base using the modified string of text elements to generate a selection of ranked passages. The computer identifies an answer to the question based on the selection of ranked passages.
