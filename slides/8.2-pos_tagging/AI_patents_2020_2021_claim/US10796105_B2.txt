<title>
Device and method for converting dialect into standard language
</title>

<abstract>
A method and a device for converting a dialect of a predetermined language into a standard language include obtaining a sentence including a dialect word, identifying at least one common word that is used identically in the dialect and the standard language in the sentence including the dialect word, replacing the identified at least one common word with a predetermined keyword, obtaining one or more vector values corresponding to the predetermined keyword and each of remaining words included in the sentence, and obtaining a standard language sentence based on an arrangement of the obtained one or more vector values.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of converting a dialect of a predetermined language into a standard language, the method comprising: obtaining, by at least one processor of an apparatus, a sentence including a dialect word; identifying, by the at least one processor, at least one common word that is used in identical form and identical meaning in the dialect and the standard language in the sentence including the dialect word; replacing, by the at least one processor, the identified at least one common word with a predetermined keyword corresponding to an object type of the identified at least one common word to create a dialect hybrid sentence including both the dialect word and the predetermined keyword; storing, on a memory of the apparatus, mapping information of the predetermined keyword including information mapping the predetermined keyword, the at least one common word, and a position of the at least one common word in the sentence; obtaining, by the at least one processor, a predetermined vector value corresponding to the predetermined keyword; obtaining, by the at least one processor, vector values corresponding to remaining words included in the dialect hybrid sentence based on the predetermined vector value; obtaining, by the at least one processor, a standard language sentence based on an arrangement of vector values that corresponds to the dialect hybrid sentence and includes the obtained predetermined vector value and the vector values corresponding to the remaining words, wherein obtaining the standard language sentence comprises: obtaining, by the at least one processor, a converted sentence including standard language words corresponding to the remaining words and the predetermined keyword based on the arrangement of the vector values that corresponds to the dialect hybrid sentence, identifying, by the at least one processor, the predetermined keyword in the converted sentence using the mapping information stored to the memory, and converting, by the at least one processor, the predetermined keyword included in the converted sentence into the at least one common word again; and displaying, on a display of the apparatus, the standard language sentence.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one common word includes a proper noun including a name of a person, a name of a place, and a name of an organization.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the obtaining of the sentence including the dialect word comprises: receiving a sentence; identifying at least one dialect word among words included in the received sentence; and determining a type of the dialect based on the identified at least one dialect word.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the obtaining of the vector values corresponding to the remaining words comprises: determining whether the predetermined keyword and the remaining words included in the dialect hybrid sentence are included in a translation mapping table; and when the predetermined keyword and a first word among the remaining words included in the dialect hybrid sentence are included in the translation mapping table, obtaining a vector value corresponding to the first word from the translation mapping table.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the obtaining of the vector values corresponding to the remaining words comprises: when the predetermined keyword and a second word among the remaining words included in the dialect hybrid sentence are not included in the translation mapping table, predicting a vector value corresponding to the second word based on an arrangement of characters constituting the second word.
6. The method of claim 4, further comprising: obtaining a set of standard language words and a set of dialect words; extracting common words used in the standard language and the dialect from the set of standard language words and the set of dialect words; assigning a first vector value to the extracted common words; assigning second vector values corresponding to each of words included in the set of standard language words based on the assigned first vector value and an arrangement of characters constituting each of the words included in the set of standard language words; assigning third vector values corresponding to each of words included in the set of dialect words based on the assigned first vector value and an arrangement of characters constituting each of the words included in the set of dialect words; and generating the translation mapping table by matching the second vector values and the third vector values.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the sentence including the dialect word includes a change in at least one of a word, an order of words, a length of a sentence, a prefix, and a suffix in comparison with the standard language sentence.
8. An apparatus comprising: a display; a memory in which at least one program is stored; and at least one processor configured to convert a dialect of a predetermined language into a standard language by executing the at least one program, wherein the at least one program comprises instructions for: obtaining a sentence including a dialect word; identifying at least one common word that is used in identical form and identical meaning in the dialect and the standard language in the sentence including the dialect word; replacing the identified at least one common word with a predetermined keyword with a predetermined keyword corresponding to an object type of the identified at least one common word to create a dialect hybrid sentence including both the dialect word and the predetermined keyword; storing mapping information of the predetermined keyword including information mapping the predetermined keyword, the at least one common word, and a position of the at least one common word in the sentence; obtaining a predetermined vector value corresponding to the predetermined keyword; obtaining vector values corresponding to remaining words included in the dialect hybrid sentence based on the predetermined vector value; obtaining a standard language sentence based on an arrangement of vector values that corresponds to the dialect hybrid sentence and includes the obtained predetermined vector value and the vector values corresponding to the remaining words, wherein obtaining the standard language sentence comprises: obtaining a converted sentence including standard language words corresponding to the remaining words and the predetermined keyword based on the arrangement of the vector values that corresponds to the dialect hybrid sentence, identifying the predetermined keyword in the converted sentence using the mapping information stored to the memory, and converting the predetermined keyword included in the converted sentence into the at least one common word again; and controlling the display to display the standard language sentence.
9. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the at least one common word includes a proper noun including a name of a person, a name of a place, and a name of an organization.
10. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the obtaining of the sentence including the dialect word comprises: receiving a sentence; identifying at least one dialect word among words included in the received sentence; and determining a type of the dialect based on the identified at least one dialect word.
11. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the obtaining of the vector values corresponding to the remaining words comprises: determining whether the predetermined keyword and the remaining words included in the dialect hybrid sentence are included in a translation mapping table; and when the predetermined keyword and a first word among the remaining words included in the dialect hybrid sentence are included in the translation mapping table, obtaining a vector value corresponding to the first word from the translation mapping table.
12. The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the obtaining of the vector values corresponding to the remaining words comprises: when the predetermined keyword and a second word among the remaining words included in the dialect hybrid sentence are not included in the translation mapping table, predicting a vector value corresponding to the second word based on an arrangement of characters constituting the second word.
13. The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the at least one program further comprises: obtaining a set of standard language words and a set of dialect words; extracting common words used in the standard language and the dialect from the set of standard language words and the set of dialect words; assigning a first vector value to the extracted common words; assigning second vector values corresponding to each of words included in the set of standard language words based on the assigned first vector value and an arrangement of characters constituting each of the words included in the set of standard language words; assigning third vector values corresponding to each of words included in the set of dialect words based on the assigned first vector value and an arrangement of characters constituting each of the words included in the set of dialect words; and generating the translation mapping table by matching the second vector values and the third vector values.
