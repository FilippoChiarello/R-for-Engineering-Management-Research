Method of Treating Inflammatory Bowel Disease with a Combination Therapy of Antibodies to IL-23 and TNF Alpha
</title>

<abstract>
A method of treating inflammatory bowel disorders, such as ulcerative colitis, comprises administering an IL-23 inhibitor, such as an anti-IL-23p19 antibody (e.g., guselkumab) and a TNF-α inhibitor, such as an anti-TNF-α antibody (e.g., golimumab).
