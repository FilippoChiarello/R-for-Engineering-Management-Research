WIND NOISE DETECTION SYSTEMS AND METHODS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods include a wind detector to receive audio input signals and output a wind detection flag including a single channel wind detection flag and a cross channel wind detection flag, each wind detection flag indicating a presence or absence of wind noise, and a fusion smoothing module to receive the plurality of wind detection flags and generate an output wind detection flag. Microphones generate the plurality of audio input signals. The wind detector and the fusion smoothing module may comprise program instructions stored in the memory for execution by a digital signal processor. The wind detector is a single channel detector to receive a single audio channel of the audio input signal and generate the single channel wind noise flag, and a cross-channel detector to compute auto correlations and a cross correlation between two or more audio channels.
