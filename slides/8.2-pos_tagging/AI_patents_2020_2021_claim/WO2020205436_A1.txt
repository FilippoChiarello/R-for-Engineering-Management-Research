CONTEXT BASED MEDIA CURATION
</title>

<abstract>
A media curation system configured to perform operations that include, capturing an image at a client device, wherein the image includes a depiction of an object, identifying an object category of the object based on the depiction of the object within the image, accessing media content associated with the object category within a media repository, generating a presentation of the media content, and causing display of the presentation of the media content within the image at the client device.

<claims>
What is claimed is: 1. A method comprising:
receiving an input at the client device, the input including an input context and an image that comprises a plurality of image features;
identifying a category based on the plurality of image features of the image in response to the receiving the input;
curating a collection of media content based on the category and the input context; and
causing displ ay of a presentation of the coll ecti on of media content at the client device. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the identifying the category based on the plurality of image features of the image includes:
identifying an object depicted in the image based on the plurality of image features; and
identifying the category based on the object depicted in the image.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the category corresponds with one or more media tags, and the collection of media content comprises a set of media items, and the curating the collection of media content includes:
accessing a media repository that comprises a plurality of media items, each media item among the plurality of media items associated with at least a media tag; and
filtering the set of media items from the plurality of media items of the media repository, based on the one or more media tags. 4. The method of claim 3, wherein the method further comprises:
receiving a request to assign one or more media tags to at least a portion of the plurality of media items.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the collection of media content includes one or more of:
graphical icons;
augmented-reality media content;
media overlays; and
auditory content.
6. The method of claim 1 , wherein the method further comprises:
generating a ranking of the collection of media content based on the plurality of image features and the input context; and
wherein the presentation of the collection of media content is based on the ranking of the collection of media content.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises:
receiving a selection of media content from among the presentation of the collection of media content; and
presenting the media content at the client device based on the plurality of image features.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the identifying the category includes: identifying a first object depicted in the image based on a first subset of the plurality of image features;
identifying a second object depicted in the image based on a second subset of the plurality of image features;
selecting a first category that corresponds with the first object and a second category that corresponds with the second object;
generating a query that comprises a set of query terms based on the first category and the second category; and
querying a media repository based on the query.
9. A system comprising:
a memory; and
at least one hardware processor coupled to the memory and comprising instructions that causes the system to perform operations comprising:
receiving an input at the client device, the input including an input context and an image that comprises a plurality of image features;
i dentifying a category based on the plurality of image features of the image in response to the receiving the input;
curating a collection of media content based on the category and the input context; and
causing display of a presentation of the collection of media content at the client device.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the identifying the category based on the plurality of image features of the image includes:
identifying an object depicted in the image based on the plurality of image features; and
identifying the category based on the object depicted in the image.
11. The system of claim 9, wherein the category corresponds with one or more media tags, and the collection of media content comprises a set of media items, and the curating the collection of media content includes:
accessing a media repository that compri ses a plurality of media item s, each media item among the plurality of media items associated with at least a media tag; and
filtering the set of media items from the plurality of media items of the media repository, based on the one or more media tags.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the instructions cause the system to perform operations further comprising:
receiving a request to assign one or more media tags to at least a portion of the plurality of media items.
13. The system of claim 9, wherein the collection of media content includes one or more of:
graphical icons;
augmented-reality media content;
media overlays; and
auditory content.
14. The system of claim 9, wherein the instructions cause the system to perform operations further comprising:
generating a ranking of the collection of media content based on the plurality of image features and the input context; and
wherein the presentation of the collection of media content is based on the ranking of the collection of media content.
15. The system of claim 9, wherein the instructions cause the system to perform operations further comprising:
receiving a selection of media content from among the presentation of the collection of media content; and
presenting the media content at the client device based on the plurality of image features.
16. The system of claim 9, wherein the identifying the category includes: identifying a first object depicted in the image based on a first subset of the plurality of image features;
identifying a second object depicted in the image based on a second subset of the plurality of image features;
selecting a first category that corresponds with the first object and a second category that corresponds with the second object;
generating a query that comprises a set of query terms based on the first category and the second category; and
querying a media repository based on the query.
17. A machine-readable storage medium comprising instructions that, when executed by one or more processors of a machine, cause the machine to perform operations comprising:
receiving an input at the client device, the input including an input context and an image that comprises a plurality of image features;
identifying a category based on the plurality of image features of the image in response to the receiving the input;
curating a collection of media content based on the category and the input context; and
causing display of a presentation of the collection of media content at the client device.
18. The machine-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein the identifying the category based on the plurality of image features of the image includes:
identifying an object depicted in the image based on the plurality of image features; and
identifying the category based on the object depicted in the image.
19. The machine-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein the category corresponds with one or more media tags, and the collection of media content comprises a set of media items, and the curating the collection of media content includes:
accessing a media repository that comprises a plurality of media items, each media item among the plurality of media items associated with at least a media tag; and
filtering the set of media items from the plurality of media items of the media repository, based on the one or more media tags.
20. The machine-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein the collection of media content includes one or more of:
