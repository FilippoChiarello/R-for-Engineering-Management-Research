DETECTION OF SPOOFING ATTACKS ON SATELLITE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
An attack detector for detecting attacks on a satellite navigation system obtains navigation messages extracted from satellite navigation signals and/or additional parameters of the satellite navigation signal from source devices. The obtained navigation messages and/or parameters are analyzed to detect satellite navigation spoofing attacks. An indicator is issued when an attack is detected.

<claims>
1. An attack detector for detecting attacks on a satellite navigation system, comprising
a communication interface configured for communicating over a network; and
processing circuitry associated with said network interface configured for:
obtaining, over said network, navigation messages extracted from satellite navigation signals by a plurality source devices;
selecting a consensus navigation message from a set of said obtained navigation messages by majority selection; and
sending an indicator of a spoofing attack to at least one source device when a navigation message obtained from said source device differs from said consensus navigation message.
2. An attack detector according to claim 1, wherein said set comprises a single navigation message for each respective source device and said consensus navigation message comprises a navigation message having a maximum count in said set.
3. An attack detector according to claim 1, wherein said set comprises, for each of said source devices, a respective specified multiple of a navigation message obtained from said source device and said consensus navigation message comprises a navigation message having a maximum count in said set.
4. An attack detector according to any one of claims 1-3, wherein said set comprises navigation messages having a same Time Of Week.
5. An attack detector according to any one of claims 1-4, wherein said processing circuitry is further configured for detecting spoofed navigation messages by analyzing parameters obtained from a GNSS receiver.
6. An attack detector according to claim 5, wherein said obtained parameters comprise at least one of:
navigational information computed by said GNSS receiver;
physical characteristics of said received satellite signal; and
data decoded from said satellite signal.
7. An attack detector according to any one of claims 1-6, wherein said processing circuitry is further configured for detecting spoofed navigation messages by analyzing sensor data obtained from at least one of said source devices.
8. An attack detector according to claim 7, wherein said sensor comprises an inertial measurement unit.
9. An attack detector according to any one of claims 5-8, wherein said processing circuitry is further configured for preventing inclusion of said spoofed navigation messages in said set.
10. A satellite navigation device, comprising:
a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver configured for receiving a satellite navigation signal and for extracting navigation messages from said satellite navigation signal; a communication interface configured for communicating over a network; and
processing circuitry associated with said GNSS receiver and said network interface, configured for:
sending said extracted navigation messages to a navigation message analyzer over said network;
obtaining a consensus navigation message and a timing parameter of said consensus navigation message from said navigation message analyzer;
detecting a spoofing attack when an extracted navigation message corresponding to said timing parameter differs from said consensus navigation message.
11. A satellite navigation device according to claim 10, wherein said timing parameter comprises a Time Of Week of said navigation message.
12. A satellite navigation device according to any one of claims 10-11, wherein said processing circuitry is further configured for periodically pushing extracted navigation messages to said navigation message analyzer.
13. A method for detecting attacks on a satellite navigation system, comprising:
obtaining, from a plurality of source devices, navigation messages extracted from satellite navigation signals; selecting a consensus navigation message from a set of said obtained navigation message by majority selection;
sending an indicator of a spoofing attack to at least one source device when a navigation message obtained from said source device differs from said consensus navigation message.
14. A method according to claim 13, wherein said set comprises a single navigation message for each respective source device and said consensus navigation message comprises a navigation message having a maximum count in said set.
15. A method according to claim 13, wherein said set comprises, for each of said source devices, a respective specified multiple of a navigation message obtained from said source device and said consensus navigation message comprises a navigation message having a maximum count in said set.
16. A method according to any one of claims 13-15, wherein said set comprises navigation messages having a same Time Of Week.
17. A method according to any one of claims 13-16, further comprising detecting spoofed navigation messages by analyzing parameters obtained from a GNSS receiver.
18. A method according to claim 17, wherein said obtained parameters comprise at least one of:
navigational information computed by said GNSS receiver;
physical characteristics of said received satellite signal; and
data decoded from said satellite signal.
19. A method according to any one of claims 13-18, further comprising detecting spoofed navigation messages by analyzing sensor data obtained from at least one of said source devices.
20. A method according to any one of claims 17-19, further comprising preventing inclusion of said spoofed navigation messages in said set.
