<title>
Portable Fuel Storage Device with a Filtering System
</title>

<abstract>
A portable fueling device that stores and filters fuel. The fueling device may include a frame configured to be towed by a towing vehicle. One or more transport members, such as wheels or skids, facilitate the movement. A fuel tank is positioned on the frame and a fuel line extends outward from the fuel tank. An end of the fuel line opposite from the frame can be configured to dispense the fuel. First and second filters are positioned along the fuel line and each is configured to remove contaminants from the fuel. The first filter is positioned upstream from the second filter and is able to filter smaller sized contaminants than the second filter. The first filter also has a larger capacity than the second filter. A pump can be positioned to move the fuel along the fuel line.

<claims>
1. A portable fueling device to store and transport fuel, the portable fueling device comprising: a frame with a hitch and one or more wheels or skids to be configured to be towed by a towing vehicle; a fuel tank mounted to the frame, the fuel tank having an interior space to contain the fuel; a fuel line that extends from the fuel tank and along the frame; a pump to move the fuel along the fuel line; first and second filters positioned along the fuel line and each configured to remove contaminants from the fuel that is stored in the fuel tank; the first filter having a larger capacity than the second filter and being configured to remove smaller contaminants from the fuel than the second filter; and the second filter positioned along the fuel line downstream from the first filter and being further configured to remove water from the fuel.
2. The portable fueling device of claim 1, wherein the first filter is a one micron filter that is able to remove the contaminants as small as one micron and the second filter is a five micron filter that is able to remove the contaminants as small as five microns.
3. The portable fueling device of claim 1, wherein the first filter has a higher beta ratio than the second filter.
4. The portable fueling device of claim 1, wherein the second filter is a coalescing filter configured to remove the water from the fuel.
5. The portable fueling device of claim 1, wherein the pump is positioned along the fuel line and downstream from both the first filter and the second filter.
6. The portable fueling device of claim 1, wherein the fuel line comprises a first end at the fuel tank and a second end downstream from the first and second filters and the pump, the second end having a dispenser to dispense the fuel.
7. The portable fueling device of claim 1, further comprising: one or more sensors positioned downstream from the first filter and the second filter; and a control system comprising a processing circuit and a communications interface circuit, the control system configured to receive signals from the one or more sensors and stop the fuel from being moved along the fuel line when a contaminant level is above a predetermined threshold.
8. A portable fueling device to store and transport fuel, the portable fueling device comprising: a frame with a hitch and wheels to be towed by a towing vehicle; a fuel tank positioned on the frame, the fuel tank having an interior space to contain the fuel; a fuel line that extends from the fuel tank; a pump to move the fuel along the fuel line; a first filter positioned on the fuel line downstream from the fuel tank, the first filter having a first capacity and configured to remove a first size of contaminants from the fuel; a second filter positioned on the fuel line downstream from the first filter, the second filter have a second capacity that is smaller than the first capacity and configured to remove a second size of the contaminants from the fuel, with the second size being larger than the first size; and the second filter being further configured to remove water from the fuel that passes through the first filter.
9. The portable fueling device of claim 8, wherein the first filter removes the contaminants as small as one micron from the fuel and the second filter removes the contaminants as small as five microns from the fuel.
10. The portable fueling device of claim 8, wherein the first filter has a higher beta ratio than the second filter.
11. The portable fueling device of claim 8, wherein the second filter is a coalescing filter configured to remove the water from the fuel.
12. The portable fueling device of claim 11, wherein the first filter is a particulate filter.
13. The portable fueling device of claim 8, wherein the pump is positioned along the fuel line and downstream from both the first filter and the second filter.
14. The portable fueling device of claim 8, further comprising: one or more sensors positioned along the fuel line and the fuel tank; and a control system comprising a processing circuit and a communications interface circuit, the control system configured to receive signals from the one or more sensors and prevent the fuel from being moved along the fuel line when a contaminant level in the fuel is above a predetermined threshold.
15. A method of transporting and filtering fuel with a portable fueling device, the method comprising: attaching a hitch of fueling device to a towing vehicle, the fueling device comprising a frame and a fuel tank with fuel; transporting the fueling device to a geographic location; activating a fuel pump and moving the fuel from the fuel tank and along a fuel line of the fueling device; moving the fuel through a first filter and removing contaminants as small as one micron from the fuel; after moving the fuel through the first filter, moving the fuel through a second filter and removing the contaminants as small as five microns from the fuel and removing water from the fuel with the second filter having a smaller capacity; the first filter having a greater capacity than the second filter to maintain a supply of the fuel at the second filter.
16. The method of claim 15, further comprising moving the fuel through the fuel pump after moving the fuel through the first filter and the second filter.
17. The method of claim 15, further comprising stopping the fuel pump when a contaminant level of the fuel downstream from the first filter and the second filter is above a predetermined threshold.
