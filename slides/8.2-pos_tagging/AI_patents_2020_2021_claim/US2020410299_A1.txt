INCREMENTAL LEARNING METHOD THROUGH DEEP LEARNING AND SUPPORT DATA
</title>

<abstract>
A method for classifying data into classes includes receiving new data; receiving support data, wherein the support data is a subset of previously classified data; processing with a first set of layers of a deep learning classifier the new data and the support data to obtain a learned representation of the new data and the support data; and applying a second set of layers of the deep learning classifier to the learned representation to associate the new data with a corresponding class.

<claims>
1. A method for classifying data into classes, the method comprising: receiving new data; receiving support data, wherein the support data is a subset of previously classified data; processing with a first set of layers of a deep learning classifier the new data and the support data to obtain a learned representation of the new data and the support data; and applying a second set of layers of the deep learning classifier to the learned representation to associate the new data with a corresponding class.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first set of layers includes all but a last layer of the deep learning classifier.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the second set of layers includes only the last layer of the deep learning classifier.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: constraining parameters of the first set of layers with a loss function.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising: adding to the loss function first and second regularizers, wherein the first regularizer is different from the second regularizer.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the first regularizer depends on parameters of the first set of layers.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the second regularizer uses Fisher information for each parameter of the first set of layers.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: feeding the learned representation to a support vector machine block for generating support vectors.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising: selecting only the support vectors that lie on a border of a classification.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising: selecting data from the new data and support data that corresponds to the support vectors and updating the support data with the selected data.
11. A classifying apparatus for classifying data into classes, the classifying apparatus comprising: an interface for receiving new data and receiving support data, wherein the support data is a subset of previously classified data; and a deep learning classifier connected to the interface and configured to, process with a first set of layers the new data and the support data to obtain a learned representation of the new data and the support data; and apply a second set of layers to the learned representation to associate the new data with a corresponding class.
12. The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the first set of layers includes all but a last layer of the deep learning classifier.
13. The apparatus of claim 12, wherein the second set of layers includes only the last layer of the deep learning classifier.
14. A method for generating support data for a deep learning classifier, the method comprising: receiving data; processing with a first set of layers of the deep learning classifier the received data to obtain a learned representation of the received data; and training a support vector machine block with the learned representation to generate support data, wherein the support data is used by the deep learning classifier to prevent catastrophic forgetting when classifying data.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the step of training comprises: generating plural support vectors based on the learned representation.
16. The method of claim 15, further comprising: selecting only those support vectors that lie on a border between classifications.
17. The method of claim 16, further comprising: collecting from the received data, only support candidate data that is associated with selected support vectors to create the support data.
18. A classifying apparatus for classifying data into classes, the classifying apparatus comprising: an interface for receiving data; and a processor connected to the interface and configured to, process with a first set of layers of a deep learning classifier the received data to obtain a learned representation of the received data; and train a support vector machine block with the learned representation to generate support data, wherein the support data is used by the deep learning classifier to prevent catastrophic forgetting when classifying data.
19. The apparatus of claim 18, wherein the processor is further configured to: generate plural support vectors based on the learned representation.
20. The apparatus of claim 19, wherein the processor is further configured to: select only those support vectors that lie on a border between classifications; and collect from the received data, only support candidate data that is associated with selected support vectors to create the support data.
