OUTPUT ARRAY NEURON CONVERSION AND CALIBRATION FOR ANALOG NEURAL MEMORY IN DEEP LEARNING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
Configurable input blocks and output blocks and physical layouts are disclosed for analog neural memory systems that utilize non-volatile memory cells. An input block can be configured to support different numbers of arrays arranged in a horizontal direction, and an output block can be configured to support different numbers of arrays arranged in a vertical direction. Adjustable components are disclosed for use in the configurable input blocks and output blocks. Systems and methods are utilized for compensating for leakage and offset in the input blocks and output blocks the in analog neural memory systems.
