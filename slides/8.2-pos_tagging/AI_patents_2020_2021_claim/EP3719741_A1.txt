IMAGE PROCESSING APPARATUS AND IMAGE PROCESSING METHOD THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
An image processing apparatus filters an image and obtains a signal in a threshold range as a shadow. The image processing apparatus obtains boundary information by applying boundary detection filters associated with different directions. The shadow is applied, based on the boundary information, to a portion of the input image to provide an output image with improved sharpness.
