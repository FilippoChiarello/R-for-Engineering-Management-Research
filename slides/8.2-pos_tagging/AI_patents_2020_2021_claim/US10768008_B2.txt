Distributed data processing systems for processing remotely captured sensor data
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the disclosure relate to processing remotely captured sensor data. A computing platform having at least one processor, a communication interface, and memory may receive, via the communication interface, from a user computing device, sensor data captured by the user computing device using one or more sensors built into the user computing device. Subsequently, the computing platform may analyze the sensor data received from the user computing device by executing one or more data processing modules. Then, the computing platform may generate trip record data based on analyzing the sensor data received from the user computing device and may store the trip record data in a trip record database. In addition, the computing platform may generate user record data based on analyzing the sensor data received from the user computing device and may store the user record data in a user record database.
