SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR MACHINE FORWARD ENERGY AND ENERGY CREDIT PURCHASE
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for machine forward energy and energy credit purchase are disclosed. An example transaction-enabling system may include a machine having an energy requirement for a task and a controller. The controller may include a resource requirement circuit to determine an amount of an energy resource for the machine to service the energy requirement, a forward resource market circuit to access a forward resource market, and a resource distribution circuit to execute a transaction of on the forward resource market in response to the determined amount of the energy resource.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A transaction-enabling system, comprising: a machine having an energy requirement for a task; and a controller, comprising: a resource requirement circuit structured to determine an amount of an energy resource for the machine to service the energy requirement; a forward resource market circuit structured to access a forward resource market; and a resource distribution circuit structured to execute a transaction of on the forward resource market in response to the determined amount of the energy resource.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the energy resource comprises an energy credit resource, and wherein the forward resource market comprises a forward market for energy credits.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the forward resource market further comprises a forward market for energy.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the forward resource market comprises at least one of a forward market for energy corresponding to the energy resource, or a forward market for energy corresponding to a substitute energy resource.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the transaction of the energy resource on the forward resource market comprises one of buying or selling the energy resource.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the resource distribution circuit is further structured to adaptively improve a cost of operation of the machine using executed transactions on the forward resource market.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the resource distribution circuit further comprises a component selected from a list of components consisting of: a machine learning component, an artificial intelligence component, and a neural network component.
8. The system of claim 1, further comprising a market forecasting circuit structured to predict a forward market price on the forward energy market.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the market forecasting circuit is further structure to predict the forward market price as one of a price for energy corresponding to the energy resource or a price for energy corresponding to a substitute energy resource.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the resource distribution circuit is further structured to interpret historical external data from at least one external data source, and to further adaptively improve a utilization of the energy resource in response to the historical external data.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the task comprises at least one of a compute task, a networking task, or an energy consumption task.
12. The system of claim 1, further comprising a forecasting circuit structured to adaptively improve a forecast for an energy resource price on the forward resource market using a machine learning component, an artificial intelligence component, or a neural network component.
13. A method, comprising: determining an amount of an energy resource for a machine to service at least one task; accessing a forward resource market; and executing a transaction on the forward resource market in response to the determined amount of the energy resource.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the energy resource comprises an energy credit resource, and wherein the forward resource market comprises a forward market for energy credits.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the forward resource market further comprises a forward market for energy.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the forward market for energy comprises one of a forward market for energy corresponding to the energy resource, or a forward market for energy corresponding to a substitute energy resource.
17. The method of claim 13, further comprising adaptively improving a utilization of the energy resource.
18. The method of claim 13, wherein the at least one task comprises at least one of a compute task, a networking task, or an energy consumption task.
19. The method of claim 13, wherein executing the transaction on the forward resource market comprises one of buying or selling the energy resource.
20. The method of claim 13, further comprising adaptively improving a cost of operation of the machine using executed transactions on the forward resource market.
21. The method of claim 13, further comprising forecasting to adaptively improve a forecast for an energy resource price on the forward resource market using a machine learning component, an artificial intelligence component, or a neural network component.
22. The method of claim 13, further comprising interpreting historical external data from at least one external data source, and further adaptively improving a utilization of the energy resource in response to the historical external data.
