<title>
Polynucleotides encoding biocatalysts and methods for hydroxylation of chemical compounds
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention provides engineered proline hydroxylase polypeptides for the production of hydroxylated compounds, polynucleotides encoding the engineered proline hydroxylases, host cells capable of expressing the engineered proline hydroxylases, and methods of using the engineered proline hydroxylases to prepare compounds useful in the production of active pharmaceutical agents.
