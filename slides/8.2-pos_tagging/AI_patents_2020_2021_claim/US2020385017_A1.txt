VEHICLE CONTROL DEVICE AND VEHICLE CONTROL METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle control device includes an obstacle recognizer configured to recognize an obstacle which is located near a vehicle and a target trajectory generator configured to generate a target trajectory in which the vehicle is to travel repeatedly with a predetermined cycle. The target trajectory generator is configured to generate the target trajectory such that a first change which is an amount of change in a road width direction from the target trajectory which is generated in a previous cycle during repeated execution and a second change which is an amount of change of a direction with respect to a direction directed from the vehicle to a point a predetermined distance away on the target trajectory between the previous cycle and a current cycle are decreased.
