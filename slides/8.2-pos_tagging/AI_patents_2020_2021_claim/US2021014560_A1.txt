ELECTRONIC APPARATUS, METHOD OF CONTROLLING THE SAME, SERVER, AND RECORDING MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is an electronic apparatus capable of autonomously recognizing an identifier of a content provider. The electronic apparatus includes: a signal input/output unit; and a processor configured to: process an image to be displayed based on a signal received through the signal input/output unit, recognize an identifier of a content provider, present in an identifier region of the image, based on an identifier mask including the identifier region where presence of the identifier is expected within the image, and perform operation based on information of the content provider corresponding to the recognized identifier.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An electronic apparatus comprising: a signal interface; and a processor configured to: process an image to be displayed based on a signal received through the signal interface, identify an identifier of a content provider, present in an identifier region of the image, based on an identifier mask including the identifier region where presence of the identifier is expected within the image, and perform an operation based on information of the content provider corresponding to the identified identifier.
2. The electronic apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the identifier region is a first identifier region, and the processor is configured to generate a self-learning model by identifying the identifier of the content provider in a second identifier region of the image, based on a plurality of second identifier masks comprising one or more second identifier regions where presence of the identifier of the content provider is expected within the received image.
3. The electronic apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the processor is configured to detect whether the identifier of the content provider is changed within the image.
4. The electronic apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to identify and detect a user interface (UI) within the image.
5. The electronic apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the processor is configured to divide the image into a plurality of regions, and identify and detect the UI from the plurality of divided regions.
6. The electronic apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the processor is configured to identify the identifier of the content provider in the detected UI.
7. The electronic apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the identifier region is a first identifier region, and the processor is configured to set the first identifier region or the second identifier region by referring to identifier positions of a plurality of content providers including the content provider.
8. The electronic apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the processor is configured to verify whether the identified identifier is repetitively identified a predetermined number of times in one identifier region.
9. The electronic apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the self-learning model comprises an image positioned in the first identifier region or the second identifier region.
10. The electronic apparatus according to claim 8, wherein the processor is configured to separate the verified identifier and apply a self-learning process to only the separated verified identifier.
11. The electronic apparatus according to claim 10, wherein the processor is configured to first compare main learning models for the identifier of the content provider within the received image, and second compare the main self-learning models based on no identification of the identifier.
12. The electronic apparatus according to claim 10, wherein the self-learning process comprises transfer learning that reuses a main learning model to learn the self-learning model.
13. The electronic apparatus according to claim 12, wherein the transfer learning uses pixel operation in units of M×N to M×N blocks.
14. The electronic apparatus according to claim 10, wherein the processor is configured to identify whether misidentification occurs in the self-learning model with respect to a main learning model, and identifies whether misidentification occurs in the self-learning model by capturing a current image N times, based on no misidentification in the self-learning model with respect to the main learning model.
15. The electronic apparatus according to claim 14, wherein the processor is configured to use the self-learning model based on no misidentification in the captured images, and use the main learning model based on the misidentification in the captured images.
16. The electronic apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the processor is configured to provide the generated self-learning model to an external server through the signal interface.
17. The electronic apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the processor is configured to receive a main learning model or the self-learning model from a server through the signal interface.
18. A method of controlling an electronic apparatus, comprising: receiving an image; identifying an identifier of a content provider, present in an identifier region of the image, based on an identifier mask including the identifier region where presence of the identifier is expected within the image; and perform an operation based on information of the content provider corresponding to the identified identifier.
19. A server comprising: a server communicator; and a processor configured to: collect a plurality of learning models generated as identifiers of content providers from a plurality of electronic apparatuses through the server communicator, determine similarity of the collected plurality of learning models, and select a learning model having a maximum similarity among the plurality of leaning models and distribute the selected learning model to electronic apparatuses among the plurality of electronic apparatuses related to the identifier of the content provider.
20. A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium having stored therein a computer program executable by a computer to cause the computer to execute an operation, the operation comprising: identify an identifier of a content provider, present in an identifier region of the image, based on an identifier mask including the identifier region where presence of the identifier is expected within the image, verify whether the identified identifier is identified a predetermined number of times in identifier regions of a plurality of images, and generate the verified identifier as a self-learning model.
