SENSING AND INTEGRATING DATA OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN ANIMAL RESEARCH
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are various embodiments for sensing and integrating data of environmental conditions in animal research. A collection device having a bracket is removably mounted to a cage. The collection device includes a sensor array that captures audio content or environmental measurements. A micro-environment monitor of the collection device can process the audio content to determine that audible or ultrasonic vocalizations of an animal are present. The micro-environment monitor sends data based at least in part on the audio content or environmental measurements to a computing environment.

<claims>
Therefore, at least the following is claimed:
1. A collection device, comprising:
a sensor array configured to sense a micro-environment of a cage; and
a micro-environment monitor, comprising:
a network interface;
at least one processor; and
program instructions stored in memory and executable by the at least one processor that, when executed, cause the micro environment monitor to send data to a computing environment using the network interface, the data based at least in part on at least one of: audio content captured by the sensor array, or a measurement provided by the sensor array.
2. The collection device of claim 1 , further comprising at least one bracket adapted to removably mount at least a portion of the collection device to the cage.
3. The collection device of claim 1 , further comprising a fastener element adapted to selectively engage with at least a portion of the cage to secure the sensor array to the at least the portion of the cage.
4. The collection device of claim 1 , wherein the network interface comprises a transceiver.
5. The collection device of claim 1 , wherein the data comprises a status message concerning a presence of a rodent in the cage, the status message comprising at least one of: no abnormal events detected, no rodent detected, a flooded cage event, a presence of mouse pups event, a presence of aggressive fighting event, a presence of injury event, a presence of chronic pain event, or a presence of mating event.
6. The collection device of claim 1 , the program instructions further causing the micro-environment monitor to obtain the at least one of: the audio content captured by the sensor array, or the measurement provided by the sensor array.
7. The collection device of claim 6, the program instructions further causing the micro-environment monitor to process the audio content to determine that audible or ultrasonic vocalizations of a rodent are present.
8. The collection device of claim 1 , wherein the sensor array comprises: a first sensor configured to capture the audio content corresponding with audible or ultrasonic vocalizations of a rodent in the cage; and
a second sensor comprising at least one of: a position sensor, a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, a light sensor, or a motion sensor.
9. A system, comprising:
a sensor array comprising a plurality of sensors, a first sensor of the plurality of sensors configured to capture audio content corresponding to audible or ultrasonic vocalizations of a rodent in a cage; and
a micro-environment monitor, comprising:
a network interface;
at least one processor; and
program instructions stored in memory and executable by the at least one processor that, when executed, cause the micro-environment monitor to send a status message concerning the rodent in the cage to a computing environment with the network interface.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the program instructions further cause the micro-environment monitor to send data to the computing environment on an intermittent basis.
1 1. The system of claim 10, wherein the plurality of sensors further comprises a second sensor comprising at least one of: a position sensor, a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, a light sensor, or a motion sensor; and the data is based at least in part on a measurement provided by the second sensor.
12. The system of claim 1 1 , wherein the program instructions further cause the micro-environment monitor to obtain at least one of: the audio content captured by the first sensor, or a temperature, a humidity, a light intensity, a light density, or a rodent occupant motion associated with the cage observed by the second sensor.
13. The system of claim 9, wherein the status message comprises at least one of: no abnormal events detected, no rodent detected, a flooded cage event, a presence of mouse pups event, a presence of aggressive fighting event, a presence of injury event, a presence of chronic pain event, or a presence of mating event.
14. The system of claim 9, wherein the program instructions further cause the micro-environment monitor to process the audio content to determine that audible or ultrasonic vocalizations of the rodent are present.
15. A method, comprising:
monitoring a cage with a sensor array comprising a plurality of sensors, a first one of the sensors configured to capture audio content comprising audible or ultrasonic vocalizations of an animal in the cage; and
sending a status message concerning the animal to a computing environment on an intermittent basis.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the animal comprises a mouse or other rodent.
17. The method of claim 15, wherein the status message comprises at least one of: no abnormal events detected, no rodent detected, a flooded cage event, a presence of mouse pups event, a presence of aggressive fighting event, a presence of injury event, a presence of chronic pain event, or a presence of mating event.
18. The method of claim 15, the method further comprising processing the audio content to determine a classification of the audible or ultrasonic vocalizations of the animal.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the status message is based at least in part on the classification of the audible or ultrasonic vocalizations of the animal.
20. The method of claim 15, wherein the plurality of sensors further comprises a second sensor comprising at least one of: a position sensor, a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, a light sensor, or a motion sensor; and the status message is further based at least in part on a measurement provided by the second sensor.
