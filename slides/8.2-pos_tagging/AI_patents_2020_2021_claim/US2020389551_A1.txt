MANAGEMENT OF COMMUNICATION NOTIFICATIONS BASED UPON GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the present invention provide notification management across a plurality of electronic communication devices based on the present situational context of the intended communication recipient. Some types of relevant situational context information include the geographic location of the intended recipient, what electronic communication devices they may have in their possession, calendar or schedule information, the presence of other people, the identity of other people present in their vicinity, their relationship to the communication sender, and context information concerning the sender, such as how frequently the sender has attempted to communicate with the intended recipient and news information relevant to the known or assumed location of the sender. Notifications are managed by adjusting which electronic communication devices emit notifications and what type of notifications are emitted.
