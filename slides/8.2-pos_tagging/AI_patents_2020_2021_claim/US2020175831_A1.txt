<title>
PRESENCE DETECTION BASED ON SIGNAL DATA
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for providing status information of a defined location are described. Data indicative of signal strength associated with radio frequency (RF) signals received by one or more devices communicating via a wireless communications protocol is accessed. A baseline signal strength profile based on the data is determined. The data indicative of signal strength associated with RF signals received by the one or more devices is monitored. Based on a comparison of the monitored data to the baseline signal strength profile, a presence of at least one person in a vicinity of the one or more devices is determined. At least one action based on the determined presence is initiated.

<claims>
1. 1-20. (canceled)
21. A system for presence detection, the system comprising: a computing device operable to: receive initial signal strength data from one or more wireless devices in a network; establish a baseline signal strength profile based on the initial signal strength data; receive additional signal strength data from the one or more wireless devices in the network; determine a presence of a person in a vicinity of the one or more wireless devices based on the additional signal strength data and the baseline signal strength profile, wherein the determined presence is based, at least in part, on a movement of a wireless device of the one or more wireless devices; and initiate at least one action based on the determined presence.
22. The system of claim 21, wherein the one or more wireless devices communicate according to one of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, 6LowPAN, Z-Wave, and Thread.
23. The system of claim 21, wherein the one or more wireless devices comprise a plurality of wireless devices, and the computing device is one of the plurality of wireless devices.
24. The system of claim 21, wherein the computing device is operable to access the signal strength data via an access point communicating according to a wireless communications protocol.
25. The system of claim 21, wherein the initial signal strength data comprises data indicative of radio frequency (RF) signal strength as received by the one or more wireless devices.
26. The system of claim 21, wherein the one or more wireless devices are part of an internet of things network.
27. The system of claim 21, wherein the initial signal strength data originates from at least one operation of the one or more wireless devices unrelated to determining presence.
28. The system of claim 21, wherein the determined presence is based, at least in part, on a change in signal strength.
29. The system of claim 21, wherein the at least one action comprises activating a security system.
30. The system of claim 21, wherein the at least one action comprises sounding an alarm an electronic communication.
31. The system of claim 21, wherein the at least one action comprises sending an electronic communication.
32. The system of claim 21, wherein the at least one action is based on a user preference.
33. The system of claim 21, wherein the computing device is operable to perform an additional action based on a change in the determined presence.
34. The system of claim 21, wherein the computing device is operable to terminate the at least one action based on a change in the determined presence.
35. The system of claim 21, wherein the computing device is operable to determine a probable location of the determined presence.
36. The system of claim 21, wherein the presence of the person is determined during a period of time in which people are not expected to be present in the vicinity of the one or more wireless devices.
37. The system of claim 21, wherein the presence is determined over a predetermined time period according to a total variance in the additional signal strength data as compared to the baseline signal strength profile.
38. The system of claim 27, wherein the presence is determined when the total variance exceeds a predetermined threshold.
39. The system of claim 21, wherein the determined presence is associated with a probability.
40. A method comprising: receiving initial signal strength data from one or more wireless devices in a network; establishing a baseline signal strength profile based on the initial signal strength data; receiving additional signal strength data from the one or more wireless devices in the network; determining a presence of a person in a vicinity of the one or more wireless devices based on the additional signal strength data and the baseline signal strength profile, wherein the determined presence is based, at least in part, on a movement of a wireless device of the one or more wireless devices; and initiating at least one action based on the determined presence.
