<title>
System and framework for dynamic regulatory change management
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the present invention provide a system for dynamic regulatory change management for an enterprise. The system continuously monitors multiple regulatory data sources to identify regulatory change management documentation. The system then scans descriptive fields within each identified regulatory change documentation for coverage area indicator terms and phrases. A machine learning system then determines an impact value for each identified regulatory change documentation for one or more regulatory inventories of the enterprise by analyzing the coverage area indicator terms and phrases. If the impact value is above a predetermined threshold, the system alerts a user dashboard associated with a particular regulatory inventory to the regulatory change documentation. If the impact value is below the predetermined threshold, the system tags the regulatory change documentation as not being relevant to the regulatory inventory.

<claims>
1. A system for dynamic regulatory change management for an enterprise, said system comprising: a memory device; and a processing device operatively coupled to the memory device, wherein the processing device is configured to execute computer-readable program code to: continuously monitor a plurality of regulatory data sources to identify regulatory change documentation; scan descriptive fields within each identified regulatory change documentation for coverage area indicator terms and phrases; cause a machine learning system to determine an impact value of each identified regulatory change documentation for one or more regulatory inventories of the enterprise by analyzing the coverage area indicator terms and phrases within each regulatory change documentation; in response to determining that an impact value of a first regulatory change documentation for a first regulatory inventory meets or exceeds a predetermined threshold, cause a user dashboard associated with the first regulatory inventory to display a regulatory change alert for the first regulatory change documentation; or in response to determining that the impact value of the first regulatory change documentation for the first regulatory inventory is below the predetermined threshold, tag the first regulatory change documentation as not being materially relevant to the first regulatory inventory, wherein the impact values are determined and dynamically updated based on sub-impact values of (1) individual coverage area indicator terms and phrases, (2) proximity levels between two or more specific coverage area indicator terms and phrases, (3) grammatical relationships between two or more specific coverage area indicator terms and phrases, and (4) time-based information, wherein the time-based information comprises at least a timing that a regulatory change is announced, a timing that the regulatory change documentation was received, a timing of when one or more portions of the regulatory change go into effect, and a timing of when one or more compliance standards need to be implemented in response to the regulatory change, which are determined based on a machine learning analysis of a continuously updated historical regulatory change database comprising previously received regulatory change documentation and user-verified determinations as to whether the previously received regulatory change documentation was materially relevant to one or more regulatory inventories.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the regulatory data sources comprise one or more electronic data feeds that monitor issuing authorities.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the regulatory data sources comprise public information space systems that include regulatory information.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein analyzing the coverage area indicator terms and phrases within each regulatory change documentation is conducted based on: sub-impact values of individual coverage area indicator terms and phrases within each regulatory change documentation.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein analyzing the coverage area indicator terms and phrases within each regulatory change documentation is conducted based on: sub-impact values of proximity levels between two or more specific coverage area indicator terms and phrases within each regulatory change documentation.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein analyzing the coverage area indicator terms and phrases within each regulatory change documentation is conducted based on: sub-impact values of grammatical relationships between two or more specific coverage area indicator terms and phrases.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein analyzing the coverage area indicator terms and phrases within each regulatory change documentation is conducted based on: sub-impact values of time-based information associated with the identified regulatory change documentation.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the displayed regulatory change alert comprises one or more of: the impact value of the first regulatory change documentation; the first regulatory change documentation; individual regulatory coverage area indicator terms and phrases within the first regulatory change documentation; sub-impact values of individual coverage area indicator terms and phrases within each regulatory change documentation; and time-based information associated with the identified regulatory change documentation.
9. A computer program product for dynamic regulatory change management for an enterprise, the computer program product comprising at least one non-transitory computer readable medium comprising computer readable instructions, the instructions comprising instructions for: continuously monitoring a plurality of regulatory data sources to identify regulatory change documentation; scanning descriptive fields within each identified regulatory change documentation for coverage area indicator terms and phrases; causing a machine learning system to determine an impact value of each identified regulatory change documentation for one or more regulatory inventories of the enterprise by analyzing the coverage area indicator terms and phrases within each regulatory change documentation; in response to determining that an impact value of a first regulatory change documentation for a first regulatory inventory meets or exceeds a predetermined threshold, causing a user dashboard associated with the first regulatory inventory to display a regulatory change alert for the first regulatory change documentation; or in response to determining that the impact value of the first regulatory change documentation for the first regulatory inventory is below the predetermined threshold, tagging the first regulatory change documentation as not being materially relevant to the first regulatory inventory, wherein the impact values are determined and dynamically updated based on sub-impact values of (1) individual coverage area indicator terms and phrases, (2) proximity levels between two or more specific coverage area indicator terms and phrases, (3) grammatical relationships between two or more specific coverage area indicator terms and phrases, and (4) time-based information, wherein the time-based information comprises at least a timing that a regulatory change is announced, a timing that the regulatory change documentation was received, a timing of when one or more portions of the regulatory change go into effect, and a timing of when one or more compliance standards need to be implemented in response to the regulatory change, which are determined based on a machine learning analysis of a continuously updated historical regulatory change database comprising previously received regulatory change documentation and user-verified determinations as to whether the previously received regulatory change documentation was materially relevant to one or more regulatory inventories.
