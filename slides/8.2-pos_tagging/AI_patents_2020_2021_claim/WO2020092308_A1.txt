REFINEMENT OF MACHINE LEARNING ENGINES FOR AUTOMATICALLY GENERATING COMPONENT-BASED USER INTERFACES
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques are disclosed relating to refining, based on user feedback, one or more machine learning engines for automatically generating component-based user interfaces. In various embodiments, a computer system stores template information that defines a plurality of component types and one or more display parameters identified for one or more user interfaces. The computer system may receive a request to generate a user interface, where the request specifies a data set to be displayed. Further, the computer system may automatically generate a user interface, where the generating is performed by one or more machine learning engines that use the template information and the data set as inputs. The computer system may then provide the user interface to one or more users, receive user feedback associated with the user interface, and train at least one of the one or more machine learning engines based on the user feedback.
