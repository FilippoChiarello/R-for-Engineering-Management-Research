<title>
Identifying an attacked computing device
</title>

<abstract>
A computer implemented method to identify an attacked computing device in a system of network-connected computing devices providing a plurality of computing services, the method including receiving a first data structure including data modeling relationships between vulnerabilities of computing services in a first proper subset of the plurality of computing services and exploitation of such vulnerabilities to identify one or more series of exploits involved in a network attack; receiving a second data structure including data modeling the computing devices in the system including the network connections of each computing device; and comparing the first and second data structures to identify the attacked computing device as an intermediate device in communications between at least two computer services in any of the one or more series of exploits.

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method to identify an attacked computing device in a system of network-connected computing devices providing a plurality of computing services with a processor integrated into a circuit, the method comprising: receiving, using the processor, a first data structure including data modeling relationships between vulnerabilities of computing services in a first proper subset of the plurality of computing services and exploitation of the vulnerabilities to identify one or more series of exploits involved in a network attack; receiving, using the processor, a second data structure including data modeling the computing devices in the system including network connections of each computing device; and comparing, using the processor, the first data structure and the second data structure to identify the attacked computing device as an intermediate device in communications between at least two computing services in any of the one or more series of exploits by following each of the one or more series of exploits, associating each exploit with a particular computing device of the computing devices, and identifying any intermediate device in communication between exploited devices as the attacked computing device.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising, in response to the identification of the attacked computing device, implementing protective measures to protect the attacked computing device from the attack.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the first data structure is an attack graph.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the attack graph is a directed acyclic graph data structure.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the second data structure is a network map.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the second data structure is automatically generated by software adapted to map a networked computer system.
7. A computer system comprising: a processor integrated into a circuit and memory storing computer program code including instructions for identifying an attacked computing device in a system of network-connected computing devices providing a plurality of computing services, including: wherein the instructions, when executed on the processor, cause the computer system to implement: receiving a first data structure including data modeling relationships between vulnerabilities of computing services in a first proper subset of the plurality of computing services and exploitation of the vulnerabilities to identify one or more series of exploits involved in a network attack; receiving a second data structure including data modeling the computing devices in the system including network connections of each computing device; and comparing the first data structure and the second data structure to identify the attacked computing device as an intermediate device in communications between at least two computing services in any of the one or more series of exploits by following each of the one or more series of exploits, associating each exploit with a particular computing device of the computing devices, and identifying any intermediate device in communication between exploited devices as the attacked computing device.
8. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing a computer program element comprising computer program code to, when loaded into a computer system and executed by a processor integrated into a circuit thereon, cause the computer system to identify an attacked computing device in a system of network-connected computing devices providing a plurality of computing services, including: wherein the computer program code, when executed on the processor, cause the computer system to implement: receiving a first data structure including data modeling relationships between vulnerabilities of computing services in a first proper subset of the plurality of computing services and exploitation of the vulnerabilities to identify one or more series of exploits involved in a network attack; receiving a second data structure including data modeling the computing devices in the system including network connections of each computing device; and comparing the first data structure and the second data structure to identify the attacked computing device as an intermediate device in communications between at least two computing services in any of the one or more series of exploits by following each of the one or more series of exploits, associating each exploit with a particular computing device of the computing devices, and identifying any intermediate device in communication between exploited devices as the attacked computing device.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein associating each exploit with a particular computing device includes identifying the particular computing device based on exploited computing services.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the attacked computing device is identified in the second data structure and not identified in the first data structure, wherein the attacked computing device is related to a service identified in both the first data structure and the second data structure.
