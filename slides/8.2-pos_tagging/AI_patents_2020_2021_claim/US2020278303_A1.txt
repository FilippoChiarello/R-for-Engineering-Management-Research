SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR SPECIFIED INSPECTION, SUPPORT METHOD FOR SPECIFIED INSPECTION, AND NON-TRANSITORY COMPUTER READABLE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
The purpose of the present invention is to increase accuracy of a specific test using an electronic microscope and improve work efficiency. Provided is a system that identifies test recipe information corresponding to an object to be tested on the basis of attribute information about a testing sample, and analyzes and evaluates the object to be tested contained in the testing sample by checking image data and element analysis data that are acquired by a measuring device in accordance with a control program for the test recipe information, against reference image data and reference element analysis data that are used as evaluation references for the object to be tested.
