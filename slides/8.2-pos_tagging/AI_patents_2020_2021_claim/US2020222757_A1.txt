<title>
Augmented Cognition Methods And Apparatus For Contemporaneous Feedback In Psychomotor Learning
</title>

<abstract>
A method of creating a scalable dynamic jointed skeleton (DJS) model for enhancing psychomotor leaning using augmented cognition methods realized by an artificial intelligence (AI) engine or image processor. The method involves extracting a DJS model from either live motion images of video files of an athlete, teacher, or expert to create a scalable reference model for using in training, whereby the AI engine extracts physical attributes of the subject including arm length, length, torso length as well as capturing successive movements of a motor skill such as swinging a gold club including position, stance, club position, swing velocity and acceleration, twisting, and more.

<claims>
1. A method to teach psychomotor skills to a live athlete or student comprising a camera, an image processor, a dynamic jointed skeleton reference model and a display device visible by the live athlete during practice, whereby; the live athlete's movements are captured by a camera in real time as a succession of video frames and filtered to remove superfluous detail; the image processor analyzes the live athlete's relevant physical attributes from the captured video frame images then scales the dimensions of the dynamic jointed skeleton to best match the live athlete's body dimensions; the scaled dynamic jointed skeletal model generates images of a jointed skeleton as a motion sequence; the generated images of the jointed skeleton model are dynamically overlaid onto the live athlete's image to create a composite video image containing both live and generated image content; and where the composite image is delivered to a video display unit for the live athlete to observe thereby delivering a real-time visual comparison of the athlete's position and movements to that of the skeleton.
2. The method of claim 1 where the size of the DJS model is scaled proportionally to the height of the live athlete's image [proportional scaling].
3. The method of claim 1 where the DJS model is scaled so that each graph edge representing body parts (forearms, legs, torso) is adjusted to match the dimensions extracted from the live athlete's image [component scaling].
4. The method of claim 3 where the acceleration of the golf club is adjusted to produce the same ball launch velocity and angle as the reference video used to create the DJS model [force scaling].
5. The method of claim 1 where the live action video image of the athlete is displayed as a silhouette overlaid by a DJS image of contrasting color.
6. The method of claim 5 where a graphical image representation of a golf course is superimposed on the composite image of the live athlete's image and the DJS model.
7. The method of claim 1 where the DJS model playback is synchronized to the live athlete's movements.
8. The method of claim 7 where the DJS model playback starts when a golfer commences his backswing.
9. The method of claim 8 where the DJS model playback pauses when the golfer reaches the top of their swing, and resumes when the golfer commences their downswing.
10. The method of claim 7 where the synchronization is executed using event triggers derived from the live action video.
11. The method of claim 1 where equipment information is included as part of the DJS model
12. The method of claim 1 where the performance of the live athlete is evaluated against a specified list of criteria.
13. The method of claim 12 where the performance rating of the athlete is used in gaming to determine rank or meritorious awards [gamification].
14. The method of claim 1 where the composite video of the live athlete's image and the DJS model are transmitted to a visual display viewable by the athlete in real time.
15. The method of claim 14 where the transmitted content comprise medium to low resolution images that do not require large communication bandwidth capability.
16. The method of claim 14 where the visual display is a heads-up display in glasses or augmented reality goggles
17. The method of claim 14 where the visual display is a HDTV, LCD, or AMOLED display.
18. The method of claim 1 where a high resolution image of the athlete's live actions are retained in the recording device for later retrieval and analysis.
19. An AI-based system for psychomotor learning comprising: A camera with an AI-engine; A subject performing an action; A dynamic jointed skeleton model of a reference subject performing the same action; Where the AI-engine processes the video streaming images of the subject performing the action to remove content from the video stream other than the subject performing the action; Where the dynamic jointed skeleton model is sized to match the image size of the DJS model to the live image of the reference subject performing the action, Where the overlaid image is transmitted to a visualization device so that the subject can see the image overlay of their actions with the DJS model
20. The method of claim 19 where motion of the DJS model is synchronized to the actions of the reference subject performing the action.
