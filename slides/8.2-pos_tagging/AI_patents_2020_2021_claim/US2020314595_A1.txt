<title>
Position Information Assisted Network Control
</title>

<abstract>
A network controller including processing circuitry may be configured to receive dynamic position information indicative of a three dimensional position of at least one mobile communication node, compare fixed position information indicative of fixed geographic locations of respective access points of a network to the dynamic position information to determine a relative position of the at least one mobile communication node relative to at least one of the access points based on the fixed position information and the dynamic position information, and provide network control instructions to at least one network asset based on the relative position.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A network controller comprising processing circuitry configured to: receive information indicative of a series of positions defining a route of an aircraft; determine relative position information defining a relative position between a plurality of access points capable of communication with the aircraft or nodes thereon and the series of positions; and determine a route communication plan defining which of the access points the aircraft or nodes thereon are to contact along the route.
2. The network controller of claim 1, wherein the route communication plan further defines a channel or frequency expected to be detected at a given time in the future along the route.
3. The network controller of claim 1, wherein the route communication plan defines a best cell at each of a series of predetermined periods of time for a duration of the route.
4. The network controller of claim 1, wherein the route communication plan defines a best cell at each of a plurality of future locations of the aircraft for a duration of the route.
5. The network controller of claim 1, wherein the route communication plan is determined based on information entered by a flight crew of the aircraft.
6. The network controller of claim 1, wherein the route communication plan is determined based on historical information.
7. The network controller of claim 1, wherein the route communication plan defines a best cell at each location along an entirety of the route.
8. The network controller of claim 1, wherein the route communication plan is determined based on a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight plan in advance of the aircraft flying the route.
9. The network controller of claim 1, wherein the route communication plan defines a list of cell identifiers for respective ones of the access points to direct the aircraft or nodes to listen for in order to facilitate a handover to a corresponding cell in the list of cell identifiers at a given time in the future.
10. The network controller of claim 1, wherein the route communication plan is calculated for future locations along the route from a current location of the aircraft.
11. The network controller of claim 1, wherein the route communication plan is calculated for future locations defining a change to the route responsive to a dynamic position change of the aircraft while the aircraft is in-flight.
12. A system comprising a plurality of cells of an air to ground communication network, a mobile communication node, and a network controller comprising processing circuitry, the processing circuitry being configured to: receive information indicative of a series of positions defining a route of an aircraft on which the mobile communication node is located; determine relative position information defining a relative position between a plurality of access points capable of communication with the aircraft or the mobile communication node and the series of positions; and determine a route communication plan defining which of the access points the aircraft or the mobile communication node thereon are to contact along the route.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the route communication plan further defines a channel or frequency expected to be detected at a given time in the future along the route.
14. The system of claim 12, wherein the route communication plan defines a best cell at each of a series of predetermined periods of time for a duration of the route.
15. The system of claim 12, wherein the route communication plan defines a best cell at each of a plurality of future locations of the aircraft for a duration of the route.
16. The system of claim 12, wherein the route communication plan is determined based on information entered by a flight crew of the aircraft, or based on historical information.
17. The system of claim 12, wherein the route communication plan defines a best cell at each location along an entirety of the route.
18. The system of claim 12, wherein the route communication plan is determined based on a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight plan in advance of the aircraft flying the route.
19. The system of claim 12, wherein the route communication plan defines a list of cell identifiers for respective ones of the access points to direct the aircraft or the mobile communication node to listen for in order to facilitate a handover to a corresponding cell in the list of cell identifiers at a given time in the future.
20. The system of claim 12, wherein the route communication plan is calculated for future locations along the route from a current location of the aircraft.
