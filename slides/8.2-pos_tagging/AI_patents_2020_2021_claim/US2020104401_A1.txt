Real-Time Measurement And System Monitoring Based On Generated Dependency Graph Models Of System Components
</title>

<abstract>
Machine data is collected from multiple sources of an operating environment such as an information technology system, factory floor, or the like, into a data intake and query system, in one embodiment. Metrics representative of the environment are included in or derived from the data. Users may interact with an interface to depict a representation of various metrics and interdependencies and that depiction is reflected in a computer storage model. Changes to the computer storage model based on the user interaction may also result in training of a machine learning model according to the user interaction, the machine learning model configured to determine a prediction, classification or clustering of a result of a first search query by utilizing a result of at least a second search query as input to the machine learning model.
