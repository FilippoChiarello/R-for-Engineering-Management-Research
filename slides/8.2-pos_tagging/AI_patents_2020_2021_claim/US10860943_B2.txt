<abstract>
This present disclosure relates to systems for providing an adaptive analytical behavioral health assistant. These systems may obtain glucose measurements from a user, execute a model of a physiological system generic to any user to generate notifications for the user, generate a modified model specific to a physiological system of the user based on the received glucose measurements, execute the modified model to generate personalized notifications, based on the modified model, generate an updated modified model, at least once, based on the modified model and additional glucose measurements, and output the notifications.
