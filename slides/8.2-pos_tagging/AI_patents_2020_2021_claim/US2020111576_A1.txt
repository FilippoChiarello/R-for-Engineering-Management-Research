<title>
PRODUCING A MULTIDIMENSIONAL SPACE DATA STRUCTURE TO PERFORM SURVIVAL ANALYSIS
</title>

<abstract>
Computer implemented methods and systems of using a trained probabilistic graphical model to predict whether a user will develop a health condition are provided. The method includes representing functional dependencies of first and second statistical models as neural networks. The method also includes receiving training data comprising time to event data with corresponding intervention data and observable variables. The method also includes training said neural networks using said training data.

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method of training a model, the model being used to predict whether a user will develop a health condition, the model being a probabilistic graphical model comprising a multidimensional observable variable space, a multidimensional latent variable space, an intervention variable space and a time to event variable, said time to event variable indicating when user is likely to develop a condition, wherein an observable variable space is dependent on a multidimensional latent space and the time to event variable is dependent on the multidimensional latent variable space and intervention variable space, wherein the intervention variable space models a treatment, the model comprising a first statistical model comprising probability distributions linking the observable variable space to the multidimensional latent variable space and a second statistical model comprising probability distributions linking the time to event variable to the multidimensional latent variable space and intervention variable space, the method comprising: representing functional dependencies of the first and second statistical models as neural networks; receiving training data comprising time to event data with corresponding intervention data and observable variables; and training said neural networks using said training data.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein a probability of the time to event variable over the intervention variable space and the multidimensional latent variable space is an antisymmetric distribution.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the probability of the time to event variable over the intervention variable space and the multidimensional latent variable space is a Weibull distribution.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein a probability of the time to event variable over the intervention variable space and the multidimensional latent variable space is a categorical distribution.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the multidimensional latent variable space comprises both discrete and continuous variables.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the multidimensional latent variable space is drawn from a multivariate Normal distribution.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the multidimensional latent variable space comprises discrete variables and the observable variables are linked to the discrete variables of the multidimensional latent variable space via a Bernoulli probability distribution.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the multidimensional latent variable space comprises continuous variables and the observable variables are linked to the continuous variables of the multidimensional latent variable space via a normal probability distribution.
9. A computer implemented method of determining whether a user will develop a health condition, the method comprising: training a model, using observational training data wherein said observational training data comprises observations regarding individuals developing said condition, the model being a probabilistic graphical model comprising an observable variable space, a latent variable space and an outcome relating to said condition, wherein an observable multidimensional variable space is dependent on a multidimensional latent variable space and a likelihood of a user developing a condition is dependent on the multidimensional latent variable space; retrieving data concerning the user, inputting the retrieved data into said model; and using said model to output if and when the user is likely to develop the condition.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the model further comprises an intervention variable used to model intervention and wherein the likelihood of a user developing a condition is dependent on the latent variable space and the intervention variable.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the likelihood of a user developing a condition is modelled as a time to event variable.
