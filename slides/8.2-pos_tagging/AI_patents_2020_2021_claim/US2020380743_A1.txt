DISPLAY APPARATUS, DISPLAY SYSTEM, AND DISPLAY SCREEN GENERATION METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A display apparatus (4) displays log data having at least one of input data to a device (1) or output data from the device (1), the log data being a binary digital signal. The display apparatus comprises: a memory (43) to store prediction data including a signal value of a prediction value of the log data and accuracy degree of the prediction value, and a signal value of an actual measurement value of the log data; a control unit (41) to generate a display screen on which a prediction value area indicating an area of the log data in normal state is depicted based on the prediction data and on which a signal wavelength of the signal value of the actual measurement value is depicted based on the signal value of the actual measurement value; and a display unit (46) to display the display screen. Thereby, the display apparatus (4) is provided, which can display that the log data deviates from the normal state and deviation degree, when the log data is in an anomalous state.
