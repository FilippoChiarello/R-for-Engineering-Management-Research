<title>
Trust agents
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and techniques are provided for trust agents. Trust agents may be enabled. A state determination may be received from each of the enabled trust agents. The state determination may indicate either a trusted state or an untrusted state. The received state determinations may be combined to determine a security state. A security measure may be enabled or disabled based on the determined security state.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving a plurality of state determinations from a plurality of trust agents, wherein each state determination indicates either a trusted state or an untrusted state: determining a security state for a computing, device based on at least one trust agent indicating the trusted state; causing the computing device to display an indication of the at least one trust agent indicating the trusted state; and based on user input received at the computing device, modifying operation of the at least one trust agent to modify when the at least one trust agent indicates the trusted state.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising enabling or disabling, by the computing device, at least one security measure of the computing device based on the determined security state.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the at least one security measure is a lock screen of the computing device.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the at least one security measure is an application requiring a credential to operate.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising before receiving the plurality of state determinations, enabling the plurality of trust agents.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising disabling one or more other trust agents, wherein a state determination is not received from the one or more disabled other trust agents.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein at least one state determination of the plurality of state determinations is based on signals received from at least one hardware sensor of the computing device.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein each of the plurality of trust agents does not communicate a state determination directly to any other trust agent of the plurality of trust agents.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving, accompanying a state determination indicating a trusted state from at least one of the plurality of trust agents, a tine component, wherein the time component indicates a time of expiration of the state determination.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising determining that the security state is an untrusted state when the state determination indicating the trusted state expires due to the time component and no other unexpired state determinations indicating a trusted state exist at the time the state determination expires.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the security state for the computing device based on at least one trust agent indicating the trusted state comprises combining the received state determinations by ORing, ANDing or AND NOTing the state determinations.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of state determinations from the plurality of trust agents are each based on a different sensor of the computing device.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the indication of the at least one trust agent indicating the trusted state comprises an indication of at least one sensor or signal that was the basis for the determined security state.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the indication of the at least one trust agent indicating the trusted state comprises at least one icon displayed in a notification area of a screen of the computing device.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the at least one icon provides access to adjustable settings for the at least one trust agent.
16. A data processing apparatus comprising; at least one processor; a memory storing instructions, which when executed by the at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to perform operations comprising: receiving a plurality of state determinations from a plurality of trust agents, wherein each state determination indicates either a trusted state or an entrusted state: determining a security state for a computing device based on at least one trust agent indicating the trusted state; causing the computing device to display an indication of the at least one trust agent indicating the trusted state; and based on user input received at the computing device, modifying operation of the at least one trust agent to modify when the at least one trust agent indicates the trusted state.
17. The data processing apparatus of claim 16, wherein the operations further comprise enabling or disabling at least one security measure of the computing device based on the determined security state.
18. The data processing apparatus of claim 17, wherein the at least one security measure comprises locking the computing device after a period of inactivity.
19. The data processing apparatus of claim 17, wherein the at least one security measure comprises requesting a credential from a user in response to an input from the user.
20. A non-transitory computer readable medium storing instructions executable by at least one processor to cause performance of operations comprising: receiving a plurality of state determinations from a plurality of trust agents, wherein each state determination indicates either a trusted state or an untrusted state: determining a security state for a computing device based on at least one trust agent indicating the trusted state; causing the computing device to display an indication of the at least one trust agent indicating the trusted state; and based on user input received at the computing device, modifying operation of the at least one trust agent to modify when the at least one trust agent indicates the trusted state.
