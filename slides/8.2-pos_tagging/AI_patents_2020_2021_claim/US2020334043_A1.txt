<title>
ADAPTIVE SYSTEM FOR SMART BOOT SEQUENCE FORMATION OF VMS FOR DISASTER RECOVERY
</title>

<abstract>
One example method includes receiving input concerning a boot order sequence, where the input includes VM metadata, entering a training phase which includes generating a boot sequence rule based on the input, using the boot sequence rule to generate a proposed boot sequence, performing the proposed boot sequence, and gathering information concerning performance of the proposed boot sequence. The gathered information can be used as a basis to generate a modified boot sequence.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: receiving input concerning a boot order sequence, wherein the input comprises VM metadata; entering a training phase which comprises generating a boot sequence rule based on the input; using the boot sequence rule to generate a proposed boot sequence; performing the proposed boot sequence; and gathering information concerning performance of the proposed boot sequence.
2. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the input further comprises a default boot sequence.
3. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the proposed boot sequence identifies an order in which a plurality of VMs are to be restored.
4. The method as recited in claim 3, wherein the order identified by the proposed boot sequence is based upon a respective application type with which each of the plurality of VMs is associated.
5. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the boot sequence rule indicates a relative restoration priority between a first VM and a second VM.
6. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the information is gathered during performance of the proposed boot sequence.
7. The method as recited in claim 1, further comprising using the information gathered concerning performance of the proposed boot sequence as a basis for modifying the proposed boot sequence to create a new boot sequence.
8. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein performing the proposed boot sequence comprises restoring a plurality of production site VMs in an order specified by the proposed boot sequence.
9. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the VM metadata comprises information concerning the performance of one or more VMs.
10. The method as recited in claim 1, further comprising comparing expected results of implementation of the proposed boot sequence with the information that was gathered concerning performance of the proposed boot sequence.
11. A non-transitory storage medium having stored therein computer-executable instructions which, when executed by one or more hardware processors, perform the operations: receiving input concerning a boot order sequence, wherein the input comprises VM metadata; entering a training phase which comprises generating a boot sequence rule based on the input; using the boot sequence rule to generate a proposed boot sequence; performing the proposed boot sequence; and gathering information concerning performance of the proposed boot sequence.
12. The non-transitory storage medium as recited in claim 11, wherein the input further comprises a default boot sequence.
13. The non-transitory storage medium as recited in claim 11, wherein the proposed boot sequence identifies an order in which a plurality of VMs are to be restored.
14. The non-transitory storage medium as recited in claim 13, wherein the order identified by the proposed boot sequence is based upon a respective application type with which each of the plurality of VMs is associated.
15. The non-transitory storage medium as recited in claim 11, wherein the boot sequence rule indicates a relative restoration priority between a first VM and a second VM.
16. The non-transitory storage medium as recited in claim 11, wherein the information is gathered during performance of the proposed boot sequence.
17. The non-transitory storage medium as recited in claim 11, wherein the operations further comprise using the information gathered concerning performance of the proposed boot sequence as a basis for modifying the proposed boot sequence to create a new boot sequence.
18. The non-transitory storage medium as recited in claim 11, wherein performing the proposed boot sequence comprises restoring a plurality of production site VMs in an order specified by the proposed boot sequence.
19. The non-transitory storage medium as recited in claim 11, wherein the VM metadata comprises information concerning the performance of one or more VMs.
20. The non-transitory storage medium as recited in claim 11, wherein the operations further comprise comparing expected results of implementation of the proposed boot sequence with the information that was gathered concerning performance of the proposed boot sequence.
