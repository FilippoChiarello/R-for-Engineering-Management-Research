</title>

<abstract>
Described herein is a methods and systems for providing a digital interactive experience. Interactive experiences include, but not limited to, synchronized video playback, video and text chat between two or more participants, and interactive live event participation combining synchronized video, text and video chatting.

<claims>
1. A method of adding a user to a digital interactive synchronized experience comprising: providing, at a server, an interaction system comprising: a publishing group comprising: a first plurality of users each: sending a media stream to a publisher; and receiving a composite media stream from a subscriber, the subscriber in communication with the publisher, the composite media stream comprising at least two of the media streams from the first plurality of users; a first user sending an invitation to a nominee user; and a moderator user, the moderator user: receiving a connection request from the nominee user, interviewing the nominee user, and approving the connection request; and a distribution group comprising a second plurality of users that receive the composite media stream from a distributor, the distributor receiving the composite media stream from the subscriber; and establishing a connection with the nominee user and the interaction system; and determining whether adding the nominee user to the publishing group exceeds a publishing threshold, if adding the nominee user to the publishing group exceeds the publishing threshold: adding the nominee user to the distribution group; and otherwise: adding the nominee user to the publishing group.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the publishing group comprising the first plurality of users wherein a first user in the first plurality of users sends the media stream to the first plurality of users.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the nominee user is in the distribution group and the connection request is a request to join the publishing group.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein determining whether adding the nominee user to the publishing group exceeds the publishing threshold further comprises comparing a count of the first plurality of users of the publishing group to a publishing threshold user count.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein determining whether adding the nominee user to the publishing group exceeds the publishing threshold further comprises comparing a current bandwidth of the first plurality of users in the publishing group to a publishing threshold bandwidth.
6. The method of claim 1 further comprising an interactive text communication involving each user in the first plurality of users and each user in the second plurality of users.
7. The method of claim 6 wherein the interactive text communication further comprises a moderation by the moderator user.
8. The method of claim 7 wherein the moderation is automatic.
9. A system for providing a digital interactive synchronized experience, the system comprising: a host server, the host server comprising a memory and a processor, a publisher receiving an application stream and a plurality of media streams corresponding to a first plurality of users in a publishing group, the publisher sending the plurality of media streams to a subscriber, the subscriber composing the application stream and at least two of the plurality of media streams into a composite stream and sending the composite stream to the first plurality of users in the publishing group, wherein the subscriber sends the composite stream comprising an interaction stream from each user in the first plurality of users to a distributor comprising a content delivery network, a second plurality of users in a distributor group receiving the composite stream from the content delivery network; and wherein the publishing group further comprises: a first user sending an invitation to a nominee user; and a moderator user, the moderator user: receiving a connection request from the nominee user, interviewing the nominee user, and approving the connection request; and wherein the processor of the host server is configured to: establish a connection with the nominee user; and determining whether adding the nominee user to the publishing group exceeds a publishing threshold, if adding the nominee user to the publishing group exceeds the publishing threshold: adding the nominee user to the distribution group; and otherwise: adding the nominee user to the publishing group.
10. The system of claim 9 wherein the composite stream instead comprises: the interaction stream from each user in the first plurality of users and each user in the second plurality of users.
11. The system of claim 10 further comprising: a playback action comprising a user identifier, a playback event, and an action message, and wherein the first plurality of users and the second plurality of users receive the playback action and change a playback of the application stream.
12. The system of claim 11 wherein the application stream comprises providing a set of instructions to a user application running locally to the user.
