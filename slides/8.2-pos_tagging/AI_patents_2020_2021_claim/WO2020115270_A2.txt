(a) feeding the subject with feed suspected to contain zearalenone prior to obtaining the test sample from the subject; and/or
(f) selecting the feed for contacting with a zearalenone neutralizing agent or applying a zearalenone neutralizing method if a deviation in the expression levels of the at least one miRNA between the test sample and the control sample indicates zearalenone exposure.
10. The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the method is for assessment of the capacity of a method or test compound to neutralize zearalenone.
11. Use of at least one miRNA selected from the group consisting of miR-1, miR-181c, miR- 206, miR-503, miR-542-3p, miR-135, miR-135a-5p, miR-129a-3p, miR-142-3p, miR-432- 5p, miR-455-5p, miR-182, miR-493-3p, miR-455-3p, miR-183, miR-140-3p, miR-7135- 3p, miR-204, miR-143-5p, miR-187, miR-335, miR-424-5p, miR-450a, miR-450b-5p, miR-450c-5p, miR-497 for detecting zearalenone effect in a test sample.
