A method and system to monitor electrical devices. A failed first component electric demand profile based on a set of observed measured electric power consumption datasets associated with a failure of a first component of an electrical device is received. At least one characteristic specification of electric power consumption for the electrical device is determined. The electrical device includes a number of components. An operational measurement corresponding to a corresponding characteristic specification within the at least one characteristic specification for the electrical device over a time duration is received. The operational measurement is compared to the corresponding characteristic specification for the electrical device, the comparing including determining an operational condition indicating an upcoming failure of the first component.
