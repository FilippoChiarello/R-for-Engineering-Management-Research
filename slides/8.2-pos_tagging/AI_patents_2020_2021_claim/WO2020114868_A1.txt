ASSOCIATING NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION CONTENT WITH VERBAL COMMUNICATION CONTENT
</title>

<abstract>
According to various embodiments, the invention relates an apparatus (100) for associating non-verbal communication content with verbal communication content, the apparatus comprising a processor (102) configured to obtain a portion of verbal communication content to be presented to a user; provide the portion of verbal communication content as an input to an intent determination model; determine, using the intent determination model, at least one intent of the portion of verbal communication content; determine, for the at least one intent, corresponding non-verbal communication content; and associate the corresponding non-verbal communication content with the portion of verbal communication content. The invention also relates to a method and a computer program product.

<claims>
1. An apparatus (100) for associating non-verbal communication content with verbal communication content, the apparatus comprising:
a processor (102) configured to:
obtain a portion of verbal communication content to be presented to a user;
provide the portion of verbal communication content as an input to a machine learning model trained to determine one or more intents from a portion of verbal communication content;
determine, using the machine learning model, at least one intent of the portion of verbal communication content;
determine, for the at least one intent, corresponding non-verbal communication content; and
associate the corresponding non-verbal communication content with the portion of verbal communication content.
2. The apparatus (100) according to claim 1, wherein the processor (102) is further configured to:
store the association between the corresponding non-verbal communication content with the portion of verbal communication content in a storage medium.
3. The apparatus (100) according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the processor
(102) is further configured to:
deliver the non-verbal communication content and the portion of verbal communication content for presentation to the user.
4. The apparatus (100) according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the non-verbal communication content is to be communicated to the user by a conversational agent.
5. The apparatus (100) according to any of claim 4, wherein the non-verbal communication content and the portion of verbal communication content to be presented to the user is determined based on at least one previous interaction between the conversational agent and a user.
6. The apparatus (100) according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the non-verbal communication content comprises at least one of: a visual focus of attention, a facial expression, a head pose, a physical movement, a posture, a gesture, a mannerism, a voice modulation or inflection, and a paralanguage element.
7. The apparatus (100) according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the processor (102) is configured to obtain the portion of verbal communication content from at least one of: a database; and a user input interface.
8. The apparatus (100) according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the processor (102) is further configured to:
receive an annotated recording of an interaction between a first human and a second human, wherein the annotated recording comprises an indication of at least one intent associated with a portion of the interaction; and
train a classifier using the portion of the interaction and the at least one intent, wherein the trained classifier comprises the machine learning model.
9. A method (600) for associating non-verbal communication content with verbal communication content, the method comprising:
obtaining (602) a portion of verbal communication content to be presented to a user;
providing (604) the portion of verbal communication content as an input to a machine learning model trained to determine one or more intents from a portion of verbal communication content;
determining (606), using the machine learning model, at least one intent of the portion of verbal communication content;
determining (608), for the at least one intent, corresponding non-verbal communication content; and associating (610) the corresponding non-verbal communication content with the portion of verbal communication content.
10. The method (600, 700) according to claim 9, further comprising, at least one of:
storing (702) the association between the corresponding non-verbal communication content with the portion of verbal communication content in a storage medium; and
presenting (704) the non-verbal communication content and the portion of verbal communication content to the user.
11. The method (600, 700) according to claim 9 or claim 10, wherein said
presenting (704) comprises presenting the non-verbal communication content and the portion of verbal communication content to the user via a conversational agent.
12. The method (600, 700) according to claim 11, wherein presenting (704) the non-verbal communication content via a conversational agent comprises causing the conversational agent to exhibit non-verbal communication characteristics and/or non-verbal communication patterns based on the non verbal communication content.
13. The method (600, 700) according to any of claims 9 to 12, further comprising, prior to said obtaining:
training (706) a machine learning model by:
receiving (708) an annotated recording of an interaction between a human coach and a subject, wherein the annotated recording comprises an indication of at least one intent associated with a portion of the interaction; and
training (710) the machine learning model using the portion of the interaction and the at least one intent.
14. A computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer-readable medium, the computer-readable medium (804) having computer-readable code embodied therein, the computer-readable code being configured such that, on execution by a suitable computer or processor (802), the computer or processor is caused to perform the method of any of claims 9 to 13.
