SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETECTING OBJECTS
</title>

<abstract>
The present teaching relates to method, system, medium, and implementations for detecting an electronic target object. A magnetic field is first generated. Magnetic field variations associated with presence of an object nearby the magnetic field are observed and analyzed to extract features characterizing the magnetic field variations. Based on such extracted features, it is determined as to whether the object corresponds to an electronic target object. If so, an alarm is triggered to indicate the detection of the electronic target object.

<claims>
WE CLAIM:
1. A method implemented on at least one machine including at least one processor and a communication platform capable of connecting to a network for detecting an electronic target object, the method comprising:
generating a magnetic field;
sensing magnetic field variations associated with presence of an object nearby the magnetic field;
extracting features characterizing the magnetic field variations;
determining whether the object is the electronic target object based on the extracted features; and
triggering, if the electronic target object is detected, an alarm in response to the detection.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the electronic target object is either turned on or turned off.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the features include at least one of a phase, a frequency, and an amplitude associated with the magnetic field variations.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of determining comprises:
checking whether the magnetic field variations meet a certain criteria based on the extracted features in accordance with one or more models characterizing expected magnetic field variations caused by presence of the electronic target object; and
assessing whether the object is the electronic target object based on the checking.
5. The method of claim 2, further comprising ascertaining whether the electronic target object is turned on.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the step of ascertaining comprises:
transmitting at least one wireless signal in accordance with corresponding at least one communication protocol;
receiving a response signal from the electronic target object sent in response to any of the at least one wireless signal;
affirming that the electronic target object is turned on if the response signal is received.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising gathering, in the event that the target object is detected, additional information related to the person with the target object and/or surround information.
8. Machine readable medium having information recorded thereon for detecting an electronic target object, the information, when read by the machine, causes the machine to perform:
generating a magnetic field;
sensing magnetic field variations associated with presence of an object nearby the magnetic field;
extracting features characterizing the magnetic field variations; determining whether the object is the electronic target object based on the extracted features; and
triggering, if the electronic target object is detected, an alarm in response to the detection.
9. The medium of claim 8, wherein the electronic target object is either turned on or turned off.
10. The medium of claim 8, wherein the features include at least one of a phase, a frequency, and an amplitude associated with the magnetic field variations.
11. The medium of claim 8, wherein the step of determining comprises:
checking whether the magnetic field variations meet a certain criteria based on the extracted features in accordance with one or more models characterizing expected magnetic field variations caused by presence of the electronic target object; and
assessing whether the object is the electronic target object based on the checking.
12. The medium of claim 9, wherein the information, when read by the machine, causes the machine to further perform ascertaining whether the electronic target object is turned on.
13. The medium of claim 12, wherein the step of ascertaining comprises:
transmitting at least one wireless signal in accordance with corresponding at least one communication protocol; receiving a response signal from the electronic target object sent in response to any of the at least one wireless signal;
affirming that the electronic target object is turned on if the response signal is received.
14. The medium of claim 8, wherein the information, when read by the machine, causes the machine further to perform gathering, in the event that the target object is detected, additional information related to the person with the target object and/or surround information.
