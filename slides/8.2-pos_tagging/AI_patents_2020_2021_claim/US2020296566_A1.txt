<title>
Dynamic Derivation of and Broadcast to Emergency Contact List
</title>

<abstract>
A system for dynamic derivation of and sending to a contact group. The system may recognize an emergency situation (natural disaster, stranded, lost cell connection) and send a confirmation that may be sent to different contact groups from a network entity. The system may also recognize anomalous user behaviors and send a message indicating the anomalous user behaviors to different contact groups from the network entity.

<claims>
1. An apparatus comprising: a processor; and a memory coupled with the processor, the memory comprising executable instructions that when executed by the processor cause the processor to effectuate operations comprising: receiving, from a mobile device, a trigger to activate a contact group based on an activity; monitoring geo-fenced information within a predetermined location of the mobile device; detecting an anomalous user behavior based on the activity and geo-fenced information; and sending one or more messages to the contact group based on detecting the anomalous behavior.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the one or more messages sent to the contact group comprise a message regarding whereabouts of a user associated with the mobile device or a yes-okay message.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, the operations further comprising monitoring a texting activity associated with the mobile device to detect the anomalous user behavior.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, the operations further comprising using sensor information from one or more sensors of the mobile device to detect the anomalous user behavior.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, the operations further comprising using polling messages sent to the mobile device or the contact group to detect the anomalous user behavior.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, the operations further comprising updating a social media profile status of a user associated with the mobile device based on detecting the anomalous behavior.
7. The apparatus of claim 1, the operations further comprising: monitoring the geo-fenced information until a conclusion of the activity; and updating an anomaly detection model used by the apparatus based on information gathered during the activity.
8. The apparatus of claim 1, the operations further comprising: monitoring the geo-fenced information until a conclusion of the activity; and updating the contact group based on information gathered during the activity.
9. A computer readable storage medium storing computer executable instructions that when executed by a computing device cause said computing device to effectuate operations comprising: receiving, from a mobile device, a trigger to activate a contact group based on an activity; monitoring geo-fenced information within a predetermined location of the mobile device; detecting an anomalous user behavior based on the activity and geo-fenced information; and sending one or more messages to the contact group based on detecting the anomalous behavior.
10. The computer readable storage medium of claim 9, wherein the one or more messages sent to the contact group comprise a message regarding whereabouts of a user associated with the mobile device or a yes-okay message.
11. The computer readable storage medium of claim 9, the operations further comprising monitoring a texting activity associated with the mobile device to detect the anomalous user behavior.
12. The computer readable storage medium of claim 9, the operations further comprising using sensor information from one or more sensors of the mobile device to detect the anomalous user behavior.
13. The computer readable storage medium of claim 9, the operations further comprising using polling messages sent to the mobile device or the contact group to detect the anomalous user behavior.
14. The computer readable storage medium of claim 9, the operations further comprising updating a social media profile status of a user associated with the mobile device based on detecting the anomalous behavior.
15. The computer readable storage medium of claim 9, the operations further comprising: monitoring the geo-fenced information until a conclusion of the activity; and updating an anomaly detection model used by an apparatus based on information gathered during the activity.
16. The computer readable storage medium of claim 9, the operations further comprising: monitoring the geo-fenced information until a conclusion of the activity; and updating the contact group based on information gathered during the activity.
17. A system comprising a mobile device; and an apparatus comprising: a processor; and a memory coupled with the processor, the memory comprising executable instructions that when executed by the processor cause the processor to effectuate operations comprising: receiving, from the mobile device, a trigger to activate a contact group based on an activity; monitoring geo-fenced information within a predetermined location of the mobile device; detecting an anomalous user behavior based on the activity and geo-fenced information; and sending one or more messages to the contact group based on detecting the anomalous behavior.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the one or more messages sent to the contact group comprise a message regarding whereabouts of a user associated with the mobile device or a yes-okay message.
19. The system of claim 17, the operations further comprising monitoring a texting activity associated with the mobile device to detect the anomalous user behavior.
20. The system of claim 17, the operations further comprising using polling messages sent to the mobile device or the contact group to detect the anomalous user behavior.
