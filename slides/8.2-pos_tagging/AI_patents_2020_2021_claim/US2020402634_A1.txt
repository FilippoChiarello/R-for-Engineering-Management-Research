DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT ON BOARD ESTIMATOR
</title>

<abstract>
Adaptive on board estimation of exogenous pharmacon responsive to transient (i.e., impermanent) physiological effects is provided. Dynamically estimating an equivalent amount of an exogenous pharmacon on board (XOB), such as insulin and/or carbohydrates, left in the subject, is based on predictions of glucose time-series data. These estimated values, such as insulin on board (JOB), are useful for diabetes management software, including decision support and/or artificial pancreas (AP) algorithms, for example.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving exogenous pharmacon data for a time T1, and glucose time-series data for a time period preceding a time T2 of on board estimation of the pharmacon; estimating baseline glucose time-series data from the time T2 of XOB estimation into a time T3 based on the data for time T1 and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system data for the time period preceding T2; iteratively estimating a plurality of glucose time-series data from the time T2 to the time T3 based on a range of possible values for the data at the time T2 and the CGM data for the time period preceding T2; comparing the baseline glucose time-series data with the plurality of glucose time-series to determine a best match from which an exogenous pharmacon on board (XOB) estimate is selected; and outputting the XOB estimate.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the exogenous pharmacon data is received from one of a subject or a connected device.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the connected device is an insulin pump.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the exogenous pharmacon data comprises at least one of insulin on board (JOB) or carbohydrates on board (COB).
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising removing at least one of non-reliable data or spurious data from the exogenous pharmacon data and the glucose time-series data.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein at least one of the exogenous pharmacon data or the glucose time-series data comprises one or more of doses or amounts of previously injected or ingested pharmacon data.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the glucose time-series data is continuous or semi-continuous.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the iteratively estimating ranges from the pharmacon being removed from 0 to the pharmacon having the full amount.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein outputting the XOB estimate comprises outputting the XOB estimate to at least one of a diabetes management system, a diabetes management algorithm, a user interface, a bolus calculator, or an artificial pancreas (AP) system.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the XOB estimate comprises the equivalent amount of a pharmacon left in a subject, wherein the pharmacon comprises at least one of insulin or carbohydrates.
11. A method comprising: receiving insulin data for a time T1, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system time-series data for a time period preceding a time T2 of insulin on board (JOB) estimation; estimating baseline glucose time-series data from the time T2 of IOB estimation into a time T3 based on the insulin data for time T1 and CGM system data for the time period preceding T2; iteratively estimating a plurality of glucose time-series data from the time T2 to the time T3 based on a range of possible values for the insulin data at the time T2 and the CGM data for the time period preceding T2; comparing the baseline glucose time-series data with the plurality of glucose time-series to determine a best match from which an IOB estimate is selected; and outputting the IOB estimate.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the insulin data is received from one of a subject or a connected device.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the connected device is an insulin pump.
14. The method of claim 11, further comprising removing at least one of non-reliable data or spurious data from the insulin data and the CGM system time-series data.
15. The method of claim 11, wherein at least one of the insulin data or the CGM system time-series data comprises one or more of doses or amounts of previously injected or ingested insulin data.
16. The method of claim 11, wherein the CGM system time-series data is continuous or semi-continuous.
17. The method of claim 11, wherein the iteratively estimating ranges from the insulin being removed from 0 to the insulin having the full amount.
18. The method of claim 11, wherein outputting the IOB estimate comprises outputting the IOB estimate to at least one of a diabetes management system, a diabetes management algorithm, a user interface, a bolus calculator, or an artificial pancreas (AP) system.
19. The method of claim 11, wherein the IOB estimate comprises the equivalent amount of insulin left in a subject.
20. A method comprising: receiving carbohydrate data for a time T1, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system time-series data for a time period preceding a time T2 of carbohydrates on board (COB) estimation; estimating baseline glucose time-series data from the time T2 of COB estimation into a time T3 based on the carbohydrate data for time T1 and CGM system data for the time period preceding T2; iteratively estimating a plurality of glucose time-series data from the time T2 to the time T3 based on a range of possible values for the carbohydrate data at the time T2 and the CGM data for the time period preceding T2; comparing the baseline glucose time-series data with the plurality of glucose time-series to determine a best match from which a COB estimate is selected; and outputting the COB estimate.
21. The method of claim 20, wherein the carbohydrate data is received from one of a subject or a connected device.
22. The method of claim 21, wherein the connected device is a glucose monitor.
23. The method of claim 20, further comprising removing at least one of non-reliable data or spurious data from the carbohydrate data and the CGM system time-series data.
24. The method of claim 20, wherein at least one of the carbohydrate data or the CGM system time-series data comprises one or more of doses or amounts of previously injected or ingested carbohydrate data.
25. The method of claim 20, wherein the CGM system time-series data is continuous or semi-continuous.
26. The method of claim 20, wherein the iteratively estimating ranges from the carbohydrates being removed from 0 to the carbohydrates having the full amount.
27. The method of claim 20, wherein outputting the COB estimate comprises outputting the COB estimate to at least one of a diabetes management system, a diabetes management algorithm, a user interface, a bolus calculator, or an artificial pancreas (AP) system.
28. The method of claim 20, wherein the COB estimate comprises the equivalent amount of carbohydrate left in a subject.
