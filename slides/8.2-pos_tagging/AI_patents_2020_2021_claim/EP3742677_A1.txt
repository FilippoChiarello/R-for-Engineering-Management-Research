DETECTION DEVICE, DETECTION METHOD, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
A detection device includes: an object data extraction unit that extracts, from one or more pieces of communication data which are transmitted from one or more electronic control units, at least part of a payload contained in communication data that satisfies a predetermined condition, information by which the communication interval between the communication data can be calculated, and a serial number of the communication data as object data; a partial sequence creation unit that creates, using the extracted object data, a partial sequence containing information corresponding to at least part of a payload and information indicating a communication interval from two or more pieces of object data with the same serial number; and a detection unit that detects, using the created partial sequence, predetermined communication data based on the order relation between at least part of a payload and the corresponding part of another payload and a communication interval. The predetermined condition is a condition for extracting only communication data which is transmitted periodically and also in conjunction with a predetermined event.

<claims>
1. A detection device comprising: an object data extraction unit that extracts, on an assumption that a same serial number is assigned to a series of pieces of communication data, from one or more pieces of communication data which are transmitted from one or more electronic control units, at least part of a payload contained in communication data that satisfies a predetermined condition, information by which a communication interval between the communication data can be calculated, and a serial number of the communication data as object data; a partial sequence creation unit that creates, using the extracted object data, a partial sequence containing information corresponding to at least part of a payload and information indicating a communication interval from two or more pieces of object data with a same serial number; and a detection unit that detects, using the created partial sequence, predetermined communication data based on an order relation between at least part of a payload and a corresponding part of another payload and a communication interval, wherein the predetermined condition is a condition for extracting only communication data which is transmitted periodically and also in conjunction with a predetermined event.
2. The detection device according to Claim 1, wherein
the predetermined condition is that a number of types of values which at least part of a payload contained in communication data can take on is less than or equal to a threshold.
3. The detection device according to Claim 1, wherein
the predetermined condition is that at least one of a type of data contained in communication data, a source of the communication data, and a destination of the communication data is a predetermined type of data, source, or destination or at least one of a type of data contained in communication data, a source of the communication data, and a destination of the communication data changes in a predetermined manner.
4. The detection device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein
the detection unit detects predetermined communication data based on an amount of change in at least part of a payload between two or more payloads and a communication interval.
5. The detection device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein
the detection unit classifies values which at least part of a payload can take on into a plurality of sets and detects predetermined communication data based on an order relation between a set to which at least part of a payload belongs and a set to which a corresponding part of another payload belongs and a communication interval.
6. A detection method comprising: an object data extraction step of extracting, on an assumption that a same serial number is assigned to a series of pieces of communication data, from one or more pieces of communication data which are transmitted from one or more electronic control units, at least part of a payload contained in communication data that satisfies a predetermined condition, information by which a communication interval between the communication data can be calculated, and a serial number of the communication data as object data; a partial sequence creation step of creating, using the extracted object data, a partial sequence containing information corresponding to at least part of a payload and information indicating a communication interval from two or more pieces of object data with a same serial number; and a detection step of detecting, using the created partial sequence, predetermined communication data based on an order relation between at least part of a payload and a corresponding part of another payload and a communication interval, wherein the predetermined condition is a condition for extracting only communication data which is transmitted periodically and also in conjunction with a predetermined event.
7. A program for making a computer function as the detection device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5.
