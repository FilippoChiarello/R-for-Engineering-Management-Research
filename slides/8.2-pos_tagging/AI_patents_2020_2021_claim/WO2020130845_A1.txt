METHOD OF ANALYSING SEISMIC DATA TO DETECT HYDROCARBONS
</title>

<abstract>
A method of analysing seismic data to detect possible hydrocarbons comprises: determining a set of data tiles from a seismic data cube of seismic data; and testing each data tile in the set of data tiles to determine whether it corresponds to a possible fluid contact.

<claims>
1. A method of analysing seismic data to determine a possible location of hydrocarbons, the method comprising:
determining a set of data tiles from a seismic data cube of seismic data; and testing each data tile in the set of data tiles to determine whether it corresponds to a possible fluid contact.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1 , wherein the seismic data comprises prestack seismic data.
3. A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the seismic data cube from which the set of data tiles are determined is a seismic data cube suitable for identifying seismic lithology reflections; and/or the method comprises obtaining a seismic data cube suitable for identifying seismic lithology reflections from the seismic data.
4. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the set of data tiles comprises tiles which are representative of a lithology change in the subsurface.
5. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein each data tile in the set of data tiles comprises or corresponds to a lateral area of more than 40 or preferably more than 400 seismic traces.
6. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the data tiles in the set of data tiles are determined:
by identifying data tiles which correspond to a reflector surface; and/or from a dip or azimuth calculation returning a local prevailing dip.
7. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein testing each data tile in the set of data tiles to determine whether it corresponds to a possible fluid contact comprises determining a correlation between amplitude and time for each tile.
8. A method as claimed in claim 7, wherein testing each data tile in the set of data tiles to determine whether it corresponds to a possible fluid contact comprises, for each tile:
obtaining a plurality of measurements representative of reservoir properties at each of the locations in the tile or of the average properties in a depth window above and/or below the tile; and
calculating a degree of co-variation between a plurality of such
measurements and the measured time or depth of the tile.
9. A method as claimed in claim 8, wherein the measurements representative of reservoir properties at each of the locations in the tile or of the average properties in a depth window above and/or below the tile show different sensitivities to reservoir fluids.
10. A method as claimed in claim 8 or 9, further comprising performing a cluster analysis on the measurements representative of reservoir properties at each of the locations in the tile or of the average properties in a depth window above and/or below the tile to identify how well traces in the data tile can be separated into a plurality of clusters.
11. A method as claimed in claim 10, wherein a time or depth of each trace is used as a means to separate the clusters.
12. A method as claimed in claim 11 , wherein the plurality of clusters consists of two clusters and the time or depth that separates the clusters corresponds to that of a fluid contact.
13. A method as claimed in claim 11 , wherein the plurality of clusters consists of three clusters and two times or depths are used to separate the clusters, the two times or depths representing those of a top and a base, respectively, of a transition zone of relatively linear dependency of depth or time and fluid-effect amplitude.
14. A method as claimed in claim 11 , wherein the plurality of clusters consists of three or more clusters and the times or depths that separate the clusters
correspond to those of a plurality of fluid contacts and/or transition zones. 15. A method as claimed in any of claims 8 to 14, wherein the degree of co variation is the Pearson correlation coefficient. 16. A method as claimed in any of claims 8 to 15, wherein the measurements representative of reservoir properties are from c angle rotations.
17. A method as claimed in any of claims 8 to 16, further comprising identifying tiles that show a relatively high co-variation of a fluid-sensitive measurement and the tile time or depth and/or a relatively low co-variation of a less fluid-sensitive measurement and the tile time or depth.
18. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, further comprising applying a filter to identify only tiles that line up with other tiles to form a larger structure above a certain size as corresponding to a possible fluid contact.
19. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, the method comprising obtaining the seismic data from a memory or acquiring the seismic data with at least one seismic source and at least one seismic receiver array.
20. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the method is performed on a computer or computer system.
21. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, further comprising outputting a set of locations corresponding to possible locations of hydrocarbons as determined by the method.
22. A method as claimed in claim 21 , further comprising drilling for
hydrocarbons at at least one of or within the output set of locations.
23. A method of prospecting for hydrocarbons comprising performing the method of claim 21 and using the output set of locations in the decision-making process for the drilling of a well.
24. A computer program product comprising computer readable instructions that, when run on a computer, is configured to cause a processer to perform the method of any of claims 1 to 21. 25. A computer program product for analysing seismic data to determine a possible location of hydrocarbons, the computer program product comprising computer readable instructions that, when run on one or more computers, are configured to cause one or more processors to:
determine a set of data tiles from a seismic data cube of seismic data; and test each data tile in the set of data tiles to determine whether it corresponds to a possible fluid contact.
