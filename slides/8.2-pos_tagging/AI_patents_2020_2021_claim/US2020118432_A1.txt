<title>
DRIVING ASSISTANCE FOR A MOTOR VEHICLE WHEN APPROACHING A TOLLGATE
</title>

<abstract>
Examples of road context attributes: speed limit signs; marking lines on the ground; speed bumps or rumble strips on the ground; obstacles such as other vehicles; drivable space.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A driving assistance method for a motor vehicle when approaching a tollgate, comprising: calculating a probability of a tollgate being present based on at least two road context attributes that are determined from the motor vehicle; and defining a road context ahead of said motor vehicle, said road context attributes being decorrelated from any concept of a tollgate.
2. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: prior to calculating the probability of a tollgate being present, processing said at least two road context attributes by: extracting parameters associated with said at least two road context attributes; and deriving an indicator representative of the temporal evolution of each extracted parameter, each derived indicator being assigned a confidence index wherein the probability of the tollgate being present is calculated from the confidence indices assigned to each derived indicator.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein said at least two road context attributes form part of a set of road context attributes ahead of the motor vehicle comprising: speed limit signs; marking lines on the ground; speed bumps or rumble strips on the ground; obstacles such as other vehicles; drivable space.
4. The method according to claim 2, wherein said associated parameters form part of a first list comprising: the speed limit extracted from a speed limit sign; the lateral distance between the motor vehicle and a speed limit sign; the number of marking lines on the ground; the number of speed bumps or rumble strips on the ground; the number of obstacles such as other vehicles whose speed is decreasing and/or stopping; the size of the drivable space.
5. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: comparing the calculated probability of presence with a decision threshold.
6. The method according to claim 5, further comprising: generating an audio and/or visual warning in the passenger compartment of the motor vehicle when the calculated probability of presence is greater than the decision threshold.
7. A driving assistance system for a motor vehicle when approaching a tollgate, comprising: an on-board processing module configured to: calculate a probability of a tollgate being present based on at least two road context attributes that are determined from the motor vehicle, and define a road context ahead of said motor vehicle, said road context attributes being decorrelated from any concept of a tollgate.
8. The driving assistance system according to claim 7, wherein all or some of the road context attributes used to calculate the probability of a tollgate being present are delivered by modules for processing images captured by an on-board camera at the front of the motor vehicle.
9. The driving assistance system according to claim 7, wherein all or some of the road context attributes used to calculate the probability of a tollgate being present are delivered by modules for processing measurements from a radar and/or a lidar on board the motor vehicle.
