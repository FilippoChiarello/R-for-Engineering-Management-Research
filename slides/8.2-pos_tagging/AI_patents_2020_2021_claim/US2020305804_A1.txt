SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DYNAMICALLY AND INTELLIGENTLY MONITORING A HOST'S GLYCEMIC CONDITION AFTER AN ALERT IS TRIGGERED
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for providing sensitive and specific alarms indicative of glycemic condition are provided herein. In an embodiment, a method of processing sensor data by a continuous analyte sensor includes: evaluating sensor data using a first function to determine whether a real time glucose value meets a first threshold; evaluating sensor data using a second function to determine whether a predicted glucose value meets a second threshold; activating a hypoglycemic indicator if either the first threshold is met or if the second threshold is predicted to be met; and providing an output based on the activated hypoglycemic indicator.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of avoiding unnecessary hyperglycemic alerts, the method comprising: initially activating a first alert state based on one or more first criteria associated with a hyperglycemic condition; waiting a time period before providing an output associated with the first alert state; actively monitoring, by a processor module, data associated with the host's hyperglycemic condition during the waiting time period; and providing an output associated with the first alert state after the waiting time period based on the data associated with the host's hyperglycemic condition meeting one or more second criteria.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the actively monitoring comprises determining an average glucose over a window of time.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the actively monitoring comprises determining an amplitude and/or direction of rate of change.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the actively monitoring comprises determining an amplitude and/or direction of rate of acceleration.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the actively monitoring comprises evaluating insulin information.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the actively monitoring comprises evaluating meal information or timing.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the waiting time period is user selectable.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising not providing output associated with the first alert state after the waiting time period based on the data associated with the host's hyperglycemic condition not meeting the one or more second criteria.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more first criteria and the one or more second criteria are the same.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more first criteria and the one or more second criteria are different.
11. The method of claim 1, further comprising transitioning from the first alert state to an inactive alert state based on the data associated with the host's hyperglycemic condition meeting one or more second criteria.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the one or more first criteria and the one or more second criteria are the same.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the one or more first criteria and the one or more second criteria are different.
14. A system for processing data, the system comprising: a continuous analyte sensor configured to be implanted within a body; and sensor electronics configured to receive and process sensor data output by the sensor, the sensor electronics including a processor configured to: initially activate a first alert state based on one or more first criteria associated with a hyperglycemic condition; wait a time period before providing an output associated with the first alert state; actively monitor data associated with the host's hyperglycemic condition during the waiting time period; and provide an output associated with the first alert state after the waiting time period based on the data associated with the host's hyperglycemic condition meeting one or more second criteria.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the actively monitoring comprises determining an average glucose over a window of time.
16. The system of claim 14, wherein the actively monitoring comprises determining an amplitude and/or direction of rate of change.
17. The system of claim 14, wherein the actively monitoring comprises determining an amplitude and/or direction of rate of acceleration.
