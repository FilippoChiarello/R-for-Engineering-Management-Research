POWER ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT FAULT DIAGNOSIS METHOD BASED ON EXTREMELY RANDOMIZED TREES AND STACKED SPARSE AUTO-ENCODER ALGORITHM
</title>

<abstract>
A power electronic circuit fault diagnosis method based on Extremely randomized trees (ET) and Stack Sparse auto-encoder (SSAE) algorithm includes the following. First, collect the fault signal and extract fault features. Then, reduce the dimensionality of fault features by calculating the importance value of all features using ET algorithm. A proportion of the features to be eliminated is determined, and a new feature set is obtained according the value of importance. Further extraction of fault features is carried by using SSAE algorithm, and hidden layer features of the last sparse auto-encoder are obtained as fault features after dimensionality reduction. Finally, the fault samples in a training set and a test set are input to the classifier for training to obtain a trained classifier. And mode identification, wherein the fault of the power electronic circuit is identified and located by the training classifier.
