VOICEPRINT RECOGNITION MODEL CONSTRUCTION
</title>

<abstract>
Technologies related to voiceprint recognition model construction are disclosed. In an implementation, a first voice input from a user is received. One or more predetermined keywords from the first voice input are detected. One or more voice segments corresponding to the one or more predetermined keywords are recorded. The voiceprint recognition model is trained based on the one or more voice segments. A second voice input is received from a user, and the user's identity is verified based on the second voice input using the voiceprint recognition model.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method, comprising: receiving a first voice input from a user; detecting one or more predetermined keywords from the first voice input, wherein the one or more predetermined keywords include at least a minimum number of required keywords, the minimum number of required keywords being based on a corresponding security requirement for training a voiceprint recognition model; recording one or more voice segments corresponding to the one or more predetermined keywords; training the voiceprint recognition model based on the one or more voice segments; receiving second voice input from a user; and verifying an identity of the user based on the second voice input using the voiceprint recognition model.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising detecting one or more predetermined keywords from the second voice input.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, further comprising recording one or more voice segments corresponding to the one or more predetermined keywords from the second voice input.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 3, further comprising updating the voiceprint recognition model based on the one or more voice segments corresponding to the one or more predetermined keywords from the second voice input.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising determining the one or more predetermined keywords from the second voice input.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the detection of the one or more predetermined keywords from the first voice input is based on an acoustic model and the one or more voice segments include one or more acoustic features same as the one or more predetermined keywords.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the detection of the one or more predetermined keywords from the first voice input is performed based on voice recognition.
8. A non-transitory, computer-readable medium storing one or more instructions executable by a computer system to perform operations comprising: receiving a first voice input from a user; detecting one or more predetermined keywords from the first voice input, wherein the one or more predetermined keywords include at least a minimum number of required keywords, the minimum number of required keywords being based on a corresponding security requirement for training a voiceprint recognition model; recording one or more voice segments corresponding to the one or more predetermined keywords; training the voiceprint recognition model based on the one or more voice segments; receiving second voice input from a user; and verifying an identity of the user based on the second voice input using the voiceprint recognition model.
9. The non-transitory, computer-readable medium of claim 8, further comprising detecting one or more predetermined keywords from the second voice input.
10. The non-transitory, computer-readable medium of claim 9, further comprising recording one or more voice segments corresponding to the one or more predetermined keywords from the second voice input.
11. The non-transitory, computer-readable medium of claim 10, further comprising updating the voiceprint recognition model based on the one or more voice segments corresponding to the one or more predetermined keywords from the second voice input.
12. The non-transitory, computer-readable medium of claim 8, further comprising determining the one or more predetermined keywords from the second voice input.
13. The non-transitory, computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein the detection of the one or more predetermined keywords from the first voice input is based on an acoustic model and the one or more voice segments include one or more acoustic features same as the one or more predetermined keywords.
14. The non-transitory, computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein the detection of the one or more predetermined keywords from the first voice input is performed based on voice recognition.
15. A computer-implemented system, comprising: one or more computers; and one or more computer memory devices interoperably coupled with the one or more computers and having tangible, non-transitory, machine-readable media storing one or more instructions that, when executed by the one or more computers, perform one or more operations comprising: receiving a first voice input from a user; detecting one or more predetermined keywords from the first voice input, wherein the one or more predetermined keywords include at least a minimum number of required keywords, the minimum number of required keywords being based on a corresponding security requirement for training a voiceprint recognition model; recording one or more voice segments corresponding to the one or more predetermined keywords; training the voiceprint recognition model based on the one or more voice segments; receiving second voice input from a user; and verifying an identity of the user based on the second voice input using the voiceprint recognition model.
16. The computer-implemented system of claim 15, further comprising detecting one or more predetermined keywords from the second voice input.
17. The computer-implemented system of claim 16, further comprising recording one or more voice segments corresponding to the one or more predetermined keywords from the second voice input.
18. The computer-implemented system of claim 17, further comprising updating the voiceprint recognition model based on the one or more voice segments corresponding to the one or more predetermined keywords from the second voice input.
19. The computer-implemented system of claim 15, further comprising determining the one or more predetermined keywords from the second voice input.
20. The computer-implemented system of claim 15, wherein the detection of the one or more predetermined keywords from the first voice input is based on an acoustic model and the one or more voice segments include one or more acoustic features same as the one or more predetermined keywords.
