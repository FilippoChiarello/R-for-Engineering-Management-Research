Method and apparatus to identify object
</title>

<abstract>
A method and apparatus to identify an object include extracting first location information, second location information, and motion information of an object from a polarimetric RADAR signal that is reflected from the object. Each of the first location information, the second location information, and the motion information correspond to each of polarized waves. The apparatus and the method also include generating a first image and a second image, combining the first image and the second image to generate first composite images, each corresponding to each of the polarized waves, and identifying the object using a neural network based on the first composite images. The first image corresponds to each of the polarized waves and includes the first location information and the second location information, and the second image corresponds to each of the polarized waves and includes the first location information and the motion information.
