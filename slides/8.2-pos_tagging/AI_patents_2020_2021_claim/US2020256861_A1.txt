<title>
IMMUNOSIGNATURING: A PATH TO EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND HEALTH MONITORING
</title>

<abstract>
Health is a complex state that represents the continuously changing outcome of nearly all human activities and interactions. The invention provides efficient methods and arrays for health monitoring, diagnosis, treatment, and preventive care. The invention monitors a broad range of identifying molecules from a subject, such as circulating antibodies, and the invention evaluates a pattern of binding of those molecules to a peptide array. The characterization of the pattern of binding of such molecules to a peptide array with the methods of the invention provide a robust measure of a state of health of a subject.

<claims>
1. 1.-83. (canceled)
84. A method of detecting a health status in a subject, the method comprising: a) obtaining a dried blood sample; b) processing the dried blood sample, thereby providing a processed dried blood sample, and obtaining an immunosignature of the sample, comprising: i) contacting the processed dried blood sample to a peptide array, wherein the peptide array comprises: a plurality of peptides, each attached to a functionalized surface on at least 10,000 different spots on the array, wherein the peptides are no longer than 20-mers in length and each of the peptides on spots on the array are diverse in peptide structure and sequence space, whereby this construction enhances an off-target binding of antibodies in the processed blood sample to multiple peptides in the array as compared to a solution phase binding of the antibodies in the processed blood sample, wherein the off-target binding comprises multiple binding interactions of the antibodies with various binding strengths to the plurality of peptides in the peptide array, ii) measuring the off-target binding of the antibodies to the plurality of peptides in the peptide array to form an immunosignature; and iii) detecting the health status of the subject based on the immunosignature, wherein the immunosignature measures changes in binding of the antibodies from the processed blood sample to the peptide array as compared to a control sera from a plurality of healthy subjects.
85. The method of claim 84, wherein the peptides on the peptide array have an average spacing ranging from 1 to 1.5 nm.
86. The method of claim 84, wherein the peptides comprise peptide mimetics.
87. The method of claim 84, wherein the peptides comprise non-natural amino acids.
88. The method of claim 84, wherein the peptides on the peptide array have an average spacing ranging from 1 to 6 nm.
89. The method of claim 84, wherein the peptides on the peptide array have an average spacing ranging from 2 to 4 nm.
90. The method of claim 84, wherein the peptides on the peptide array have an average spacing ranging from 1 to 1.5 nm.
91. The method of claim 84, wherein the method is performed on the array comprising a plurality of in-situ synthesized peptides of no longer than 20-mers in length attached to the functionalized surface on the at least 10,000 different spots on the array, wherein the in-situ synthesis of the peptides comprises the steps of: a) adding a first monomer to a pre-determined fraction of locations on the solid support; b) adding a second monomer to a pre-determined fraction of locations on the solid support, wherein the pre-determined fraction of locations for the second monomer includes locations containing the first monomer and locations with no monomer; c) adding a third monomer to a pre-determined fraction of locations on the solid support, wherein the pre-determined fraction of locations for the second monomer includes locations containing the first and second monomer, locations containing the second monomer and locations containing no monomer; and d) repeating steps a-c with a defined set of monomers until the peptide reach a desired average length and the sum of the fractions total of the defined set of monomers is at least 100%.
92. The method of claim 91, wherein the array further comprises monomers chosen from the group consisting of nucleic acids and peptide nucleic acids.
93. The method of claim 91, wherein the monomers are attached to the array by a linker molecule.
94. The method of claim 91, wherein at least 5% of the peptides have a length of at least 12 residues.
