<title>
Antigen Discovery for T Cell Receptors Isolated from Patient Tumors Recognizing Wild-Type Antigens and Potent Peptide Mimotopes

<claims>
1. 1.-20. (canceled)
21. A method of creating a cell library of candidate antigens of a T-cell receptor (TCR), the method comprising: providing a population of cells; introducing into the cells nucleic acids and a CRISPR system to create polypeptides comprising the candidate antigens, wherein the polypeptides are configured to be displayed on a surface of the cells; and allowing the cells to express and display the candidate antigens on the surface of the cells.
22. The method of claim 21, wherein the cells are yeast cells.
23. The method of claim 21, wherein the polypeptides further comprise a tag.
24. The method of claim 21, wherein the cells co-express the candidate antigens and MHC proteins, or portions thereof.
25. The method of claim 24, wherein the cells co-express the candidate antigens and binding domains of the MHC proteins.
26. The method of claim 25, wherein the binding domains comprise α1 and α2 domains of a Class I MHC protein and a β2 microglobulin.
27. The method of claim 24, wherein the MHC proteins, or portions thereof, are complexed to the candidate antigens.
28. The method of claim 23, wherein the tag is a barcode, and the method further comprises selecting a subset of the cells using the barcode.
29. The method of claim 21, further comprising monitoring the cell library by detecting the tag.
30. The method of claim 21, further comprising screening the cells displaying the candidate antigens and identifying candidate antigens that bind to the TCR.
31. The method of claim 30, wherein the screening comprises combining a multimerized TCR with the cell library expressing the candidate antigens, and selecting cells that bind to the multimerized TCR.
32. The method of claim 31, further comprising isolating candidate antigens displayed on the cells that bind to the multimerized TCR.
33. The method of claim 21, wherein one or more of the candidate antigens bind to an orphan TCR.
34. The method of claim 21, wherein one or more of the candidate antigens are unknown antigens of the TCR.
35. The method of claim 21, wherein the cell library comprises at least 108 different single chain polypeptides each comprising a candidate antigen and a binding domain of a MHC protein.
36. The method of claim 35, wherein the MHC protein is an allele of HLA-A2.
37. The method of claim 36, wherein the HLA-A2 allele comprises a Y84A amino acid substitution.
38. The method of claim 21, wherein the cell library is a multiplexed cell library.
39. The method of claim 21, wherein: the cells are yeast cells; the cells co-express the candidate antigens and binding domains of the MHC proteins, wherein the binding domains comprise α1 and α2 domains of a Class I MHC protein and a β2 microglobulin; and wherein the binding domains are complexed to the candidate antigens.
40. The method of claim 39, wherein the cell library comprises at least 108 different single chain polypeptides.
