IDENTIFICATION OF SURGERY CANDIDATES USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to computer-based clinical decision support tools including, computer-implemented methods, computer systems, and computer program products for clinical decision support. These tools assist the clinician in identifying epilepsy patients who are candidates for surgery and utilize a combination of natural language processing, corpus linguistics, and machine learning techniques.

<claims>
1. One or more non-transitory machine-readable media including machine instructions for performing a method for identifying an epilepsy patient as a candidate for surgery, the method comprising executing instructions, by at least one programmable processor, causing the at least one programmable processor to perform operations comprising: implementing a pre-trained support vector machine (SVM) on a set of data consisting of n-grams extracted from a corpus of clinical text of an epilepsy patient, wherein the SVM is pre-trained on a training set consisting of two sets of n-grams extracted from two corpora of clinical text, a first corpus consisting of clinical text from a population of epilepsy patients that were referred for surgery and a second corpus consisting of clinical text from a population of epilepsy patients that were never referred for surgery.
2. The one or more non-transitory machine-readable media of claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise, prior to the step of implementing the pre-trained SVM, extracting the n-grams from the corpus of clinical text prior to or concurrent with receiving the set of data.
3. The one or more non-transitory machine-readable media of claim 2, wherein the operations further comprise structuring the data.
4. The one or more non-transitory machine-readable media of claim 3, wherein the operation of structuring the data includes one or more of tagging parts of speech, replacing abbreviations with words, correcting misspelled words, converting all words to lower-case, and removing n-grams containing non-ASCII characters.
5. The one or more non-transitory machine-readable media of claim 4, wherein the data is further structured by removing words found in the National Library of Medicine stopwords list.
6. The one or more non-transitory machine-readable media of claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise querying a database of electronic records to identify documents for inclusion in the corpus of clinical text of the epilepsy patient.
7. The one or more non-transitory machine-readable media of claim 6, wherein each document of the corpora of clinical text of the epilepsy patient satisfies each of the following criteria: it was created for an office visit, it is over 100 characters in length, it comprises an ICD-9-CM code for epilepsy, and it is signed by an attending clinician, resident, fellow, or nurse practitioner.
8. The one or more non-transitory machine-readable media of claim 1, wherein the n-grams are selected from one or more of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams.
9. The one or more non-transitory machine-readable media of claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise displaying a result of the implementation of the SVM on a graphical user interface.
10. The one or more non-transitory machine-readable media of claim 9, wherein the display comprises one or a combination of two or more of text, color, imagery, or sound, indicating whether the epilepsy patient is a candidate for surgery.
11. A system comprising the one or more non-transitory machine-readable media of claim 1 operatively linked to one or more databases of electronic medical records.
