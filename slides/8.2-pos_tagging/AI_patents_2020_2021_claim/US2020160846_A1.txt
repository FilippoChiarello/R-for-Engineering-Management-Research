SPEAKER RECOGNITION DEVICE, SPEAKER RECOGNITION METHOD, AND RECORDING MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A speaker recognition device according to the present disclosure includes: an acoustic feature calculator that calculates, from utterance data indicating a voice of an obtained utterance, acoustic feature of the voice of the utterance; a statistic calculator that calculates an utterance data statistic from the calculated acoustic feature; a speaker feature extractor that extracts speaker feature of a speaker of the utterance data from the calculated utterance data statistic using a deep neural network (DNN); a similarity calculator that calculates a similarity between the extracted speaker feature and pre-stored speaker feature of at least one registered speaker; and a speaker recognizer that recognizes the speaker of the utterance data based on the calculated similarity.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A speaker recognition device, comprising: an acoustic feature calculator that calculates, from utterance data indicating a voice of an utterance obtained, acoustic feature of the voice of the utterance; a statistic calculator that calculates an utterance data statistic from the acoustic feature; a speaker feature extractor that extracts speaker feature of a speaker of the utterance data from the utterance data statistic using a deep neural network (DNN); a similarity calculator that calculates a similarity between the speaker feature and pre-stored speaker feature of at least one registered speaker; and a speaker recognizer that recognizes the speaker of the utterance data based on the similarity.
2. The speaker recognition device according to claim 1, wherein the utterance data statistic is a statistic over an entire utterance that is obtained by performing statistical processing for extracting characteristics of the entire utterance from the acoustic feature, the entire utterance including the utterance.
3. The speaker recognition device according to claim 1, wherein the statistic calculator extracts the utterance data statistic by classifying components of the acoustic feature into classes and calculating a mean for each of the classes to obtain the utterance data statistic.
4. The speaker recognition device according to claim 1, wherein the statistic calculator infers a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) from an universal background model (UBM), and calculates, as the utterance data statistic, a difference between a super vector obtained by concatenating mean vectors of respective Gaussian distributions of the GMM and a super vector obtained by concatenating mean vectors of respective Gaussian distributions of the UBM, the GMM being a speaker model for the utterance data and formed by mixing the Gaussian distributions each corresponding to a different one of classes into which components of the acoustic feature of the voice of the utterance are classified, the UBM being an initial model and formed by mixing the Gaussian distributions each corresponding to a different one of classes into which components of acoustic feature of voices of utterances of many unspecified speakers are classified.
5. The speaker recognition device according to claim 1, wherein the DNN includes an input layer, a plurality of intermediate layers, and an output layer, and the speaker feature extractor extracts the speaker feature from any one of the plurality of intermediate layers of the DNN.
6. The speaker recognition device according to claim 5, wherein the DNN is a bottleneck DNN, and a total number of nodes in one of the plurality of intermediate layers is less than a total number of nodes in a remainder of the plurality of intermediate layers.
7. A speaker recognition method executed by a computer, the speaker recognition method comprising: calculating, from utterance data indicating a voice of an utterance obtained, acoustic feature of the voice of the utterance; calculating an utterance data statistic from the acoustic feature; extracting speaker feature of a speaker of the utterance data from the utterance data statistic using a deep neural network (DNN); calculating a similarity between the speaker feature and pre-stored speaker feature of at least one registered speaker; and recognizing the speaker of the utterance data based on the similarity.
8. A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium on which a computer program is recorded, the computer program causing a computer to execute: calculating, from utterance data indicating a voice of an utterance obtained, acoustic feature of the voice of the utterance; calculating an utterance data statistic from the acoustic feature; extracting speaker feature of a speaker of the utterance data from the utterance data statistic using a deep neural network (DNN); calculating a similarity between the speaker feature and pre-stored speaker feature of at least one registered speaker; and recognizing the speaker of the utterance data based on the similarity.
