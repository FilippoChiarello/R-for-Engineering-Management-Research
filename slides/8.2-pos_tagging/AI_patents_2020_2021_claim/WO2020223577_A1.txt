IMAGE-BASED PARKING RECOGNITION AND NAVIGATION
</title>

<abstract>
A method for managing vehicles comprises: detecting motion of an object at a first location associated with a geographic area using a motion sensor, the geographic area including one or more parking locations; responsive to detecting the motion of the object at the first location, capturing, using one or more cameras, image data associated with the first location; using one or more edge processors located within a threshold proximity of the geographic area to access a machine learning computer vision model. The one or more edge processors are configured to execute instructions locally to the first location to perform operations comprising: obtaining, at the computer vision model, the image data associated with the object; determining, by the computer vision model, that the object is a vehicle; identifying, by the computer vision model, one or more vehicle specific parameters associated with the vehicle; and determine the one or more vehicle specific parameters that identify the vehicle.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A computerized vehicle management system, comprising:
a non-transitory memory;
one or more processors coupled to the non-transitory memory and configured to execute instructions to perform operations comprising:
detecting motion of an object at a first location associated with a geographic area using a motion sensor, the geographic area including one or more parking locations;
responsive to detecting the motion of the object at the first location, capturing, using one or more cameras, image data associated with the first location;
using one or more edge processors located within a threshold proximity of the geographic area to access a machine learning computer vision model, wherein the one or more edge processors are configured to execute instructions locally to the first location to perform operations comprising:
obtaining, at the computer vision model, the image data associated with the object;
determining, by the computer vision model, that the object is a vehicle;
identifying, by the computer vision model, one or more vehicle specific parameters associated with the vehicle; and
determine the one or more vehicle specific parameters that identify the vehicle;
determining that a user account identified by the one or more vehicle specific parameters matches a vehicle-user account stored in the computerized vehicle management system by comparing vehicle specific parameters against a vehicle-user account database included in the computerized vehicle management system;
executing one or more actions with respect to the user account in the computerized vehicle management system; and responsive to executing the one or more actions with respect to the user account, transmitting instructions to an access control mechanism at the geographic area to permit access to the one or more parking locations by the vehicle.
2. The system of claim 1, the operations further comprising:
determining that the vehicle is not associated with a user account stored in the computerized vehicle management system;
in response to determining the vehicle is not associated with a user account stored in the computerized vehicle management system;
determine that the first location is within a threshold distance to a mobile user device associated with a user associated with the vehicle; and
transmitting a prompt to the mobile user device, wherein the prompt is configured to auto-fill the one or more vehicle parameters into a user request to create a new user account in the computerized vehicle management system.
3. The system of claim 1, the operations further comprising:
determining that the vehicle is not associated with a user account stored in the computerized vehicle management system;
in response to determining the vehicle is not associated with a user account stored in the computerized vehicle management system; and
enabling a user associated with the vehicle to make a parking payment without creating a user account in the computerized vehicle management system.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein executing the one or more actions on the user account includes charging a fee to the user account.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the operations further comprising:
identifying a user status associated with the user account; and
selecting, from the one or more parking locations, a parking location based on the user status. 6. The system of claim 1, wherein the first location is a refueling station or a charging station.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the image data includes two or more images taken from different angles.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the image data includes video clips captured by one or more security cameras installed within the geographic area.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the edge processors are located locally to the geographical area to provide a shortened computing response time.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the machine learning computer vision model is configured to determine one of the following vehicle specific parameters: color, make, year, model, size, weight, engine type, and fuel type.
