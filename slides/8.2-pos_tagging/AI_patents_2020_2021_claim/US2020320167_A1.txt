METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR ADVANCED DOCUMENT REDACTION
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for advanced document redaction are disclosed. According to one embodiment, a system comprises a parser that analyzes documents to identify structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from a document. A candidates generator generates a list of words for redaction from the structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. A replacement engine replaces one or more words from the list of words with one or more of a replacement word, random characters, and random numbers.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system, comprising: a parser that analyzes documents to identify structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from a document; a candidates generator that generates a list of words for redaction from the structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data; and a replacement engine that replaces one or more words from the list of words with one or more of a replacement word, random characters, and random numbers.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the candidates generator uses natural language processing metadata to generate the list of words.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the candidates generator uses semi-structured metadata to generate the list of words.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the replacement engine uses replacement metadata to generate the replacement word, the replacement metadata including dictionaries and words to ignore.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the document is a PDF document.
6. The system of claim 5, further comprising a PDF evaluator that determines whether the replacement word uses a same space within the document as a replaced word from the list of words.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the replacement engine uses parse trees to validate a redacted document for grammatical integrity, the redacted document having the one or more words from the list of words replaced.
8. The system of claim 7, further comprising an information extraction system that trains a machine learning model using the redacted document.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the replacement engine compares a list of keywords against the list of words and does not replace keywords that appear on the list of words.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein a redaction server generates a redacted document from the document.
11. The system of claim 10, further comprising a machine learning system that uses the redacted document for training a model.
12. The system of claim 11, further comprising an information extraction system that uses the model trained with the redacted document.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the information extraction system processes one or more unredacted customer documents to identify relevant data using the model.
14. The system of claim 12, wherein the redacted document is used to debug the information extraction system.
15. The system of claim 10, further comprising one or more of data storage, NLP metadata storage, semi-structured metadata storage, and replacement metadata storage.
16. The system of claim 10, further comprising a user interface for setting one or more of a threshold for less frequent words, a parse tree overlap threshold, and a documents overlap threshold.
17. The system of claim 10, wherein the redacted document has all text obfuscated except for keywords.
18. The system of claim 10, wherein the redacted document obfuscates confidential keywords and ignores other keywords.
