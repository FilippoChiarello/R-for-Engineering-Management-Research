RECONFIGURABLE FABRIC CONFIGURATION USING SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL ROUTING
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for reconfigurable fabric configuration using spatial and temporal routing are disclosed. A plurality of clusters within a reconfigurable fabric is allocated, where the plurality of clusters is configured to execute one or more functions. A first spatial routing and a first temporal routing through the reconfigurable fabric are calculated. A second spatial routing and a second temporal routing through the reconfigurable fabric are calculated. The first and second spatial routings and the first and second temporal routings are optimized. The one or more functions are executed using routings that were optimized. The first spatial routing and the second spatial routing enable a logical connection for data transfer between at least two clusters of the plurality of clusters. The optimizing places routing instructions in clusters along a routing path within the reconfigurable fabric. The routing instructions are placed in unused cluster control instruction locations to enable spatial routing.
