<title>
Network for medical image analysis, decision support system, and related graphical user interface (GUI) applications
</title>

<abstract>
Described herein is a platform and supported graphical user interface (GUI) decision-making tools for use by medical practitioners and/or their patients, e.g., to aide in the process of making decisions about a course of cancer treatment and/or to track treatment and/or the progress of a disease.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A network-based system for generating a disease risk map for use as a decision-making support for evaluating risk of cancer or risk of recurrence of cancer, the system comprising: a processor; and a memory having instructions stored thereon, wherein the instructions, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to: (i) access one or more medical images associated with a particular patient from a database (ii) perform an analysis of the one or more medical images associated with the particular patient using a machine learning algorithm, to generate the risk map, wherein the risk map comprises a visual representation of tissue overlaid with graphical denotations marking one or more regions of risk of cancer or risk of recurrence of cancer; and (iii) cause display of the risk map via a graphical user interface (GUI) for presentation and/or review of the risk map by a user.
2. 2-49. (canceled)
50. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more medical images comprise one or more magnetic resonance images (MRIs).
51. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more medical images comprise (i) one or more PET/CT image(s) and/or (ii) one or more SPECT/CT image(s).
52. The system of claim 1, wherein the visual representation of tissue is at least a portion of one of the one or more medical images of the particular patient.
53. The system of claim 1, wherein the cancer is prostate cancer.
54. The system of claim 1, wherein the visual representation of tissue comprises a visual representation of bone.
55. The system of claim 1, wherein the analysis of the one or more medical images comprises geographic identification of one or more specific tissue region(s) within at least one of the one or more medical images.
56. The system of claim 55, wherein the analysis of the one or more medical images further comprises creation of a 3D image of the one or more geographically identified specific tissue region(s) with the one or more medical images overlaid.
57. The system of claim 55, wherein the one or more specific tissue region(s) comprise one or members selected from the group consisting of organs, organ structures, sub-organs, organ regions.
58. The system of claim 55, wherein the one or more specific tissue region(s) comprise one or more particular bones.
59. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions cause the processor to generate a radiologist report for the particular patient based at least in part on the analysis of the one or more medical images.
60. The system of claim 59, wherein the radiologist report comprises the one or more medical images and/or the risk map.
61. The system of claim 59, wherein the radiologist report comprises one or more reference images and/or reference risk maps.
62. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions cause the processor to apply a machine learning algorithm to update a process for automatically analyzing the one or more medical images using accumulated image data in the database.
63. A method for generating a disease risk map for use as a decision-making support for evaluating risk of cancer or risk of recurrence of cancer, the method comprising: (i) accessing, by the processor, one or more medical images associated with a particular patient from a database; (ii) automatically analyzing, by the processor, using a machine learning algorithm, the one or more medical images to generate the risk map, wherein the risk map comprises a visual representation of tissue overlaid with graphical denotations marking one or more regions of risk of cancer or risk of recurrence of cancer; (iii) causing, by the processor, display of the risk map via a graphical user interface (GUI) for presentation and/or review of the risk map by a user.
