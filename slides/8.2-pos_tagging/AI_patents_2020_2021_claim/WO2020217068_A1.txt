MRI SCANNER-COMPATIBLE VIRTUAL REALITY SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects and embodiments provide an MRI scanner-compatible virtual reality system comprising: user equipment locatable within an MRI scanner bore, the user equipment being configured to provide a subject with an immersive virtual environment; the system further comprising: at least one sensor configured to track eye movement of the subject; wherein interaction of the subject with the immersive virtual environment is controlled by the tracked eye movement. Aspects and embodiments may be implemented in a manner which recognises that VR techniques, which typically rely upon dynamic movement of a VR subject, can be used to aid with maintenance of minimal motion of a subject to be placed within an MRI scanner bore. Implementations may be such that calmness of a subject can be increased and awareness of their physical surroundings diminished, thus allowing for successful MRI image acquisition whilst seeking to minimise distress, boredom and/or frustration experienced by the subject under study.

<claims>
1. An MRI scanner-compatible virtual reality system comprising:
user equipment locatable within an MRI scanner bore, said user equipment being configured to provide a subject with an immersive virtual environment;
said system further comprising:
at least one sensor configured to track eye movement of said subject ;
wherein interaction of said subject with said immersive virtual environment is controlled by said tracked eye movement.
2. A system according to claim 1, wherein elements of said user equipment are constructed from materials which do not influence a magnetic field within said MRI scanner bore.
3. A system according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein elements of said VR systems which are magnetically or electrically disruptive are located outside said scanner bore.
4. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein visual input for provision of said immersive virtual environment is relayed to said subject from outside the scanner bore via an optical system including a projector and one or more mirrors.
5. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein said at least one sensor configured to track eye movement of said subject comprises at least one camera forming part of said user equipment, and wherein said cameras are located on said user equipment a distance from a subject placed in said user equipment selected to mitigate electromagnetic interference in an MRI image captured by use of said scanner bore.
6. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein a processing device required to create said virtual reality environment is located outside said scanner bore.
7. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein said user equipment is dimensioned to fit within said scanner bore.
8. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein one or more elements of said virtual reality system is removably decouplable from said MRI scanner.
9. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein interaction of said subject with said immersive virtual environment is primarily controlled by said tracked eye movement.
10. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein said user equipment comprises one or more limiters, located within said user equipment, to restrict head movement of said subject.
11. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein said tracked eye movement comprises: gaze estimation achieved via pupil tracking.
12. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein said tracked eye movement comprises: deformable eye shape tracking.
13. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein said tracked eye movement comprises: pupil tracking including head pose compensation.
14. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein said tracked eye movement comprises: determining, from images obtained by said sensors, subject head movement and wherein said system is configured to use said determined head movement to correct or compensate MRI images obtained by said MRI scanner.
15. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein changes in subject head pose are estimated based on displacements of eye corners determined from one or more images of said subject 's eye captured by said sensors, and wherein said changes are used to provide motion compensation.
16. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein said system is configured to provide a subject with an interactive gaze target to provide subject feedback and improve overall engagement with a target.
17. A system according to claim 16, wherein said interactive gaze target comprises: an icon which changes or evolves whilst gaze of said subject is determined to remain in contact with said gaze target.
18. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein said immersive virtual environment is concordant with a physical environment experienced by said subject.
19. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein said user equipment includes sound sensors configured to provide an input to said system such that an aural landscape forming part of said virtual environment includes main elements of an aural landscape within said scanner bore.
20. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein said user equipment includes one or more motion sensors configured to provide an input to said system such that a visual landscape forming part of said virtual environment is concordant with motion experienced by a subject within said scanner bore.
21. A system according to any preceding claim, wherein said system comprises: sound and image sensors configured to provide said system with information about a party located outside said scanner bore and to insert said party into said virtual environment to interact with said subject.
