Systems and methods for generating and consuming power from natural gas
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided to mitigate flaring of natural gas. A natural gas processing system may process raw natural gas into a fuel gas stream that may be used to power any number of on-site power generation modules. In turn, the power generation modules may convert the fuel gas stream into an electrical output, which may be employed to power any number of distributed computing units housed within one or more mobile data centers. In certain embodiments, the distributed computing units may be adapted to mine cryptocurrency or perform other distributed computing tasks to generate revenue.
