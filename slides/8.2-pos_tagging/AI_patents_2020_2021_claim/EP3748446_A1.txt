ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS AND METHODS OF PRETREATING AND ADDITIVELY PRINTING ON WORKPIECES
</title>

<abstract>
Methods of additively printing an extension segment on a workpiece may include pretreating a workpiece-interface of a workpiece using an energy beam from an additive manufacturing machine, providing a pretreated workpiece-interface having received a pretreatment, with the pretreatment remediating an aberrant feature of the workpiece and/or the workpiece-interface. Such methods may additionally include additively printing an extension segment on the pretreated workpiece-interface using the energy beam from the additive manufacturing machine. Exemplary additive manufacturing system for printing an extension segment on a workpiece may include a controller operably coupled to a vision system and an additive manufacturing machine.

<claims>
1. A method of additively printing an extension segment (206) on a workpiece (116), the method comprising: pretreating a workpiece-interface (120) of a workpiece (116) using an energy beam (144) from an additive manufacturing machine (104), providing a pretreated workpiece-interface (1504) having received a pretreatment, the pretreatment remediating an aberrant feature of the workpiece (116) and/or the workpiece-interface (120); and additively printing an extension segment (206) on the pretreated workpiece-interface (1504) using the energy beam (144) from the additive manufacturing machine (104).
2. The method of claim 1, comprising: determining a workpiece-interface (120) from one or more digital representations of one or more fields of view (114) having been captured by a vision system (102); and transmitting to an additive manufacturing machine (104), one or more pretreatment commands (1900) configured to expose the workpiece-interface (120) to the pretreatment.
3. The method of claim 2, comprising:
transmitting to an additive manufacturing machine (104), one or more print commands (1300) configured to additively print the extension segment (206) on the pretreated workpiece-interface (1504).
4. The method of claim 2 or 3, comprising: generating the one or more pretreatment commands (1900) based at least in part on the one or more digital representations of the one or more fields of view (114); and/or generating the one or more print commands (1300) based at least in part on the one or more digital representations of the one or more fields of view (114).
5. The method of any preceding claim, comprising: determining a pretreated workpiece-interface (1504) from one or more digital representations of one or more fields of view (114) having been captured by a vision system (102); and transmitting to an additive manufacturing machine (104), one or more print commands (1300) configured to additively print the extension segment (206) on the pretreated workpiece-interface (1504).
6. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the pretreatment comprises:
additive-leveling at least a portion of the workpiece-interface (120) and/or melt-leveling at least a portion of the workpiece-interface (120).
7. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the pretreatment comprises:
heat-conditioning at least a portion of the workpiece-interface (120).
8. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the pretreatment comprises:
removing oxidation, contaminants, debris, and/or subtractive modification artifacts from at least a portion of the workpiece-interface (120).
9. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the pretreatment comprises:
modifying the grain structure of the workpiece (116) at or near the workpiece-interface (120).
10. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the pretreatment comprises: additive-leveling a first portion of the workpiece-interface (120); and melt-leveling a second portion of the workpiece-interface (120).
11. The method of any preceding claim, comprising:
pretreating the workpiece-interface (120) using an energy beam (144) at a first energy density and additively printing the extension segment (206) on the pretreated workpiece-interface (1504) using the energy beam (144) at a second energy density, wherein the first energy density is from about 10% to about 100% of the second energy density.
12. The method of any preceding claim, comprising:
pretreating the workpiece-interface (120) using an energy beam (144) at a first energy density and additively printing the extension segment (206) on the pretreated workpiece-interface (1504) using the energy beam (144) at a second energy density, wherein the first energy density is from about 100% to about 300% of the second energy density.
13. The method of any preceding claim, comprising:
additively printing the extension segment (206) on the pretreated workpiece-interface (1504) using an energy density of from about 70 J/mm3 to about 200 J/mm3.
14. The method of any preceding claim, comprising: pretreating the workpiece-interface (120) based at least in part on a pretreatment-CAD model (1500), the pretreatment-CAD model (1500) generated and/or determined based at least in part on the one or more digital representations of the one or more fields of view (114); and/or additively printing the extension segment (206) on the pretreated workpiece-interface (1504) based at least in part on an extension segment-CAD model (800), the extension segment-CAD model (800) generated and/or determined based at least in part on the one or more digital representations of the one or more fields of view (114).
15. An additive manufacturing system (100), comprising:
a controller (2600) operably coupled to a vision system (102) and an additive manufacturing machine (104), the controller (2600) comprising one or more computer readable medium (2606) and one or more processors (2604), the one or more computer readable medium (2606) comprising computer-executable instructions (2608), which, when executed by the one or more processors (2604), cause the additive manufacturing system (100) to: pretreat a workpiece-interface (120) using an energy beam (144) from the additive manufacturing machine (104), providing a pretreated workpiece-interface (1504), wherein pretreat the workpiece-interface (120) comprises additive-leveling the workpiece-interface (120) and/or melt-leveling the workpiece-interface (120); and additively print an extension segment (206) on the pretreated workpiece-interface (1504) using the energy beam (144) from the additive manufacturing machine (104).
