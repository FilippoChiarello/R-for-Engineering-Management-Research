<title>
System and method for dynamic temporary groups
</title>

<abstract>
A method for forming and disbanding dynamic temporary groups includes receiving a plurality of contacts at the facility, wherein each contact is associated with a respective user and a respective set of attributes; identifying a first subset of contacts which share a first common attribute; and dynamically forming a temporary group of contacts by determining a second common attribute shared by a second subset of the contacts, wherein the second subset of contacts is a smaller subset of the first subset of contacts. The method also includes identifying a related goods or service, based on the second common attribute, and presenting an offer for the related goods or services to the second subset of contacts and not to member contacts of the first subset that are not member contacts of the second subset of contacts.

<claims>
1. A method for dynamic groups, comprising: receiving, by a computer system of a facility, a plurality of contacts at the facility, wherein each contact is associated with a respective user, an external communication device, and a respective set of attributes; identifying, by the computer system of the facility, a first subset of contacts which share a first common attribute; retrieving, by the computer system of the facility, respective additional attributes of each of the first subset of contacts from a context store; dynamically forming a temporary group of contacts, by the computer system of the facility, by determining a second common attribute shared by a second subset of the contacts, wherein the second subset of contacts is a smaller subset of the first subset of contacts, wherein the computer system of the facility, identifies the second common attribute from among the additional attributes; based on the second common attribute, identifying by the computer system of the facility, a related goods or service; and presenting, by the computer system of the facility, to the external communication device, an offer for the related goods or services to the second subset of contacts and not to member contacts of the first subset that are not member contacts of the second subset of contacts.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the facility comprises a contact center and the plurality of contacts comprise contacts received by the contact center.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the related goods or service comprises routing each of the member contacts of the second subset of contacts to a supervisor.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the related goods or service comprises routing each of the member contacts of the second subset of contacts to a predetermined agent of the contact center associated with the second common attribute.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein the related goods or service comprises providing a predetermined advertisement associated with the second common attribute.
6. The method of claim 1, comprising: constructing, in near real time, by the computer system of the facility, a profile of each member contact of the second subset of contacts based on one or more of the first common attribute and the respective additional attributes.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein dynamically forming the temporary group of contacts is based on membership changes for the first subset of contacts.
8. The method of claim 1, comprising: disbanding, by the computer system of the facility, the dynamically formed temporary group after a predetermined time period after being formed.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the predetermined time period is less than thirty minutes.
10. A system for managing dynamic groups at a facility, comprising: a memory device storing executable instructions; and a processor in communication with the memory device, wherein the processor, when executing the executable instructions: receives a plurality of contacts at the facility, wherein each contact is associated with a respective user, an external communication device, and a respective set of attributes; identifies a first subset of contacts which share a first common attribute; retrieves respective additional attributes of each of the first subset of contacts from a context store; dynamically forms a temporary group of contacts by determining a second common attribute shared by a second subset of the contacts, wherein the second subset of contacts is a smaller subset of the first subset of contacts, wherein the second common attribute is identified from among the additional attributes; identifies, based on the second common attribute a related goods or service; and presents an offer to the external communication device for the related goods or services to the second subset of contacts and not to member contacts of the first subset that are not member contacts of the second subset of contacts.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the facility comprises a contact center and the plurality of contacts comprise contacts received by the contact center.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the related goods or service comprises routing each of the member contacts of the second subset of contacts to a supervisor.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the related goods or service comprises routing each of the member contacts of the second subset of contacts to a predetermined agent of the contact center associated with the second common attribute.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the related goods or service comprises providing a predetermined advertisement associated with the second common attribute.
15. The system of claim 10, wherein the processor, when executing the executable code: constructs, in near real time, a profile of each member contact of the second subset of contacts based on one or more of the first common attribute and the respective additional attributes.
16. The system of claim 10, wherein dynamically forming the temporary group of contacts is based on membership changes for the first subset of contacts.
17. The system of claim 10, wherein the processor, when executing the executable code: disbands the dynamically formed temporary group after a predetermined time period after being formed.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the predetermined time period is less than thirty minutes.
