PERFORMING DATA PROCESSING BASED ON DECISION TREE
</title>

<abstract>
Disclose herein are methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on computer storage media, for data processing. One of the methods includes: determining, by a first computing device based on service data possessed by the first computing device, whether a leaf value of a leaf node of a decision tree at least possibly matches information included in the service data; in response to determining that the leaf value at least possibly matches the information included in the first service data, determining; a first data selection value corresponding to the leaf node; and performing oblivious transfer with a second computing device that processes a decision tree model of the decision tree by using the first data selection value as an input to obtain first target data for determining a prediction result of the decision forest.

1. (canceled)
2. A computer-implemented method comprising: determining that a particular leaf node in a decision forest that includes at least one decision tree is likely matched, wherein the decision tree comprises at least one burst node and at least two leaf nodes; in response to determining that the particular leaf node is likely matched, identifying a first data set that is associated with the particular leaf node, wherein the first data set comprises (i) a random number, and (ii) a leaf value ciphertext; and performing oblivious transfer with a data owner using the first data set as an input.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein identifying the first data set comprises: generating a random number for each leaf node in the decision forest.
4. The method of claim 2, comprising encrypting a leaf value associated with the particular leaf node using a random number.
5. The method of claim 2, comprising identifying a second data set that is associated with the particular leaf node.
6. The method of claim 2, comprising transmitting leaf value associated with the particular leaf node to the data owner.
7. The method of claim 2, comprising: selecting, from the decision forest, a particular decision tree whose burst nodes are associated with service data as a target decision tree.
8. A computer-implemented system, comprising one or more computers, and one or more computer memory devices interoperably coupled with the one or more computers and having tangible, non-transitory, machine-readable media storing one or more instructions that, when executed by the one or more computers, perform operations comprising: determining that a particular leaf node in a decision forest that includes at least one decision tree is likely matched, wherein the decision tree comprises at least one burst node and at least two leaf nodes; in response to determining that the particular leaf node is likely matched, identifying a first data set that is associated with the particular leaf node, wherein the first data set comprises (i) a random number, and (ii) a leaf value ciphertext; and performing oblivious transfer with a data owner using the first data set as an input.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein identifying the first data set comprises: generating a random number for each leaf node in the decision forest.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the operations comprise encrypting a leaf value associated with the particular leaf node using a random number.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the operations comprise identifying a second data set that is associated with the particular leaf node.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the operations comprise transmitting leaf value associated with the particular leaf node to the data owner.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the operations comprise: selecting, from the decision forest, a particular decision tree whose burst nodes are associated with service data as a target decision tree.
14. A non-transitory, computer-readable medium storing one or more instructions executable by a computer system to perform operations comprising: determining that a particular leaf node in a decision forest that includes at least one decision tree is likely matched, wherein the decision tree comprises at least one burst node and at least two leaf nodes; in response to determining that the particular leaf node is likely matched, identifying a first data set that is associated with the particular leaf node, wherein the first data set comprises (i) a random number, and (ii) a leaf value ciphertext; and performing oblivious transfer with a data owner using the first data set as an input.
15. The medium of claim 14, wherein identifying the first data set comprises: generating a random number for each leaf node in the decision forest.
16. The medium of claim 14, wherein the operations comprise encrypting a leaf value associated with the particular leaf node using a random number.
17. The medium of claim 14, wherein the operations comprise identifying a second data set that is associated with the particular leaf node.
18. The medium of claim 14, wherein the operations comprise transmitting leaf value associated with the particular leaf node to the data owner.
19. The medium of claim 14, wherein the operations comprise: selecting, from the decision forest, a particular decision tree whose burst nodes are associated with service data as a target decision tree.
