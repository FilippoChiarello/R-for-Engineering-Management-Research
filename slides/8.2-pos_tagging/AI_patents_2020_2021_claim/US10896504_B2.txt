Image processing apparatus, medical image diagnostic apparatus, and program
</title>

<abstract>
According to one embodiment, an image processing apparatus includes processing circuitry. The processing circuitry is configured to acquire medical image data. The processing circuitry is configured to obtain spatial distribution of likelihood values representing a likelihood of corresponding to a textual pattern in a predetermined region of a medical image for each of a plurality of textual patterns based on the medical image data. The processing circuitry is configured to calculate feature values in the predetermined region of the medical image based on the spatial distribution obtained for the each of the plurality of textual patterns.
