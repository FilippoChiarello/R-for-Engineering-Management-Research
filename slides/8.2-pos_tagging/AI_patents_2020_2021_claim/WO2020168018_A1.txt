MEDICATION RETURN PLATFORM FOR MANAGING RETURNS OF EXCESS MEDICATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A medication return platform for managing returns of excess medications receives shipments of excess medications from users and re-distributes and/or disposes the excess medications. To facilitate the return process, the medication return platform may compensate users for returned medications. Compensation may be received from subscribers that purchase unexpired excess medications for re-distribution. The medication return platform may distribute user health information collected during the medication return process to providers and subscribers to provide accurate feedback on the benefits and side effects of medications.
