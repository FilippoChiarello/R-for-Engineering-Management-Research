SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR IMMERSION MECHANOTHERAPY
</title>

<abstract>
Provided is a method is provided for treating metastatic disease using immersion mechanotherapy. The method comprises providing a vessel containing an amount of medium for immersing at least a portion of a subject, and applying one or more programmed cycles of ultrasound waves to the subject through the medium for a pre-determined period of time. Also provided is a device for implementing the immersion mechanotherapy.

<claims>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A device for treating target cells in a subject, the device comprising:
an immersion element containing a liquid medium to immerse a body part of the subject, and
one or more ultrasound transducers configured to generate a sequence of programmed cycles of waves to the body part through the liquid medium thereby applying periodic forces to the target cells for a period of time,
wherein the periodic force applied to the target cells triggers a mechanically-induced apoptotic process in the target cells.
2. The device of claim 1, wherein the target cells comprise cancer cells or metastasized cells.
3. The device of claim 1, wherein the immersion element comprises a shape or geometric configuration to regulate a wave field of the sequence of programmed cycles of waves.
4. The device of claim 1, wherein the liquid medium is water.
5. The device of claim 1, wherein the one or more ultrasound transducers are mounted to a robotic arm.
6. The device of claim 4, wherein the robotic arm is controlled to position the one or more ultrasound transducers into a desired location or orientation.
7. The device of claim 1, wherein the one or more ultrasound transducers are phased array ultrasound transducers.
8. The device of claim 1, wherein the one or more ultrasound transducers are sealed and water-proof.
9. The device of claim 1, wherein a frequency of the periodic force is in a range of 30 kHz to 250 kHz.
10. The device of claim 1, wherein a frequency of the periodic force is in a range of 5 kHz to 50 kHz.
11. The device of claim 1, wherein a frequency of the periodic force is in a range of 150 kHz to 1MHz.
12. The device of claim 1, wherein the periodic force promotes or preserves survival and growth of normal cells of the subject.
13. The device of claim 1, wherein a frequency, magnitude of the periodic force and the period of time are determined based at least in part on a type of the target cells.
14. The device of claim 1, wherein the sequence of programmed cycles of waves are generated according to a treatment plan or a type of therapeutic procedure.
15. The device of claim 14, wherein the treatment plan is generated using machine learning techniques.
16. The device of claim 1, further comprising a controller configured to control the one or more ultrasound transducers based on sensor data.
17. A method for treating target cells in a subject, comprising:
providing an immersion element containing a liquid medium for immersing a body part of the subject; and
generating, by one or more ultrasound transducers, a sequence of programmed cycles of waves to the body part through the liquid medium thereby applying periodic forces to the target cells for a period of time,
wherein the periodic force applied to the target cells triggers mechanically-induced apoptotic process in the target cells.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the target cells comprise cancer cells or metastasized cells.
19. The method of claim 17, wherein the immersion element comprises a shape or geometric configuration to regulate a wave field of the sequence of programmed cycles of waves.
20. The method of claim 17, wherein the liquid medium is water.
21. The method of claim 17, wherein the one or more ultrasound transducers are mounted to a robotic arm.
22. The method of claim 21, wherein the robotic arm is controlled to position the one or more ultrasound transducers into a desired location or orientation.
23. The method of claim 17, wherein the one or more ultrasound transducers are phased array ultrasound transducers.
24. The method of claim 17, wherein the one or more ultrasound transducers are sealed and water-proof.
25. The method of claim 17, wherein a frequency of the periodic force is in a range of 30 kHz to 250 kHz.
26. The method of claim 17, wherein a frequency of the periodic force is in a range of 5 kHz to 50 kHz.
27. The method of claim 17, wherein a frequency of the periodic force is in a range of 150 kHz to 1MHz.
28. The method of claim 17, wherein the periodic force promotes or preserves survival and growth of normal cells of the subject.
29. The method of claim 17, wherein a frequency, magnitude of the periodic force and the period of time are determined based at least in part on a type of the target cells.
30. The method of claim 17, wherein the sequence of programmed cycles of waves are generated according to a treatment plan or a type of therapeutic procedure.
31. The method of claim 30, further comprising generating the treatment plan using a machine learning algorithm trained model.
32. The method of claim 17, further comprising controlling the one or more ultrasound transducers based on sensor data.
33. The method of claim 17, further comprising providing different types of therapeutic procedures by adjusting the sequence of programmed cycles of waves.
