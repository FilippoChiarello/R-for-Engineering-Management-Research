<title>
Artificial salt tolerant protein, its synthetic method and coding gene thereof and use of said coding gene
</title>

<abstract>
This invention relates to an artificial salt tolerant protein NLEA with the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID No.1 and a synthetic method of salt tolerant protein NLEA comprising the steps of retrieving different types of LEA proteins from LEA database; making multiple sequence alignment on different types of LEA proteins to obtain conserved short peptides; selecting hydrophilic short peptides with a hydrophilicity index higher than 3.5 from conserved short peptides; arranging and splicing hydrophilic short peptides in the order of isoelectric point size from large to small, to obtain salt tolerant protein NLEA. This invention involves bioinformatics analysis by retrieving different LEA conserved amino acid sequences of LEA protein data. Physical properties are analyzed to find short peptides of high hydrophilicity, and such short peptides are arranged in the order of isoelectric point size and spliced to get a new hydrophilic amino acid sequence.
