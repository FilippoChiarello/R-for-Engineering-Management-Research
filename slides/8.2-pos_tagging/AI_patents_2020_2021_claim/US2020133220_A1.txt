METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR MANAGING MICROGRID ASSETS
</title>

<abstract>
A method for managing a microgrid, the microgrid having an intermittent energy source and energy storage, comprising: using a microgrid asset management system, dispatching the energy storage to maintain optimal power flow to and from a power grid by: producing a generation forecast and a generation forecast error probability distribution for an intermittent energy source coupled to the microgrid from a historic generation forecast and one or more measurements; generating random intermittent energy source generation inputs from at least one of historic generation data, the historic generation forecast, and the generation forecast error probability distribution; using the random intermittent energy source generation inputs, calculating a microgrid performance value using a microgrid performance model and a microgrid financial value using a microgrid financial model; and, selecting an energy storage dispatch scenario to optimize operation of the microgrid using at least one of the microgrid performance value and the microgrid financial value.
