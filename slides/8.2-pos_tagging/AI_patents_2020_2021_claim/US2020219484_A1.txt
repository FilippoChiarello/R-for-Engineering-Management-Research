<title>
METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR MANAGING CHATBOTS BASED ON TOPIC SENSITIVITY
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments for managing a chatbot by one or more processors are described. A communication is received from a first individual. The presence of a second individual within a proximity of a speaker is detected. A response to the communication is determined based on the communication and the detected presence of the second individual. The determined response is caused to be executed.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method, by one or more processors, for managing a chatbot comprising: receiving a communication from a first individual; detecting the presence of a second individual within a proximity of a speaker; determining a response to the communication based on the communication and the detected presence of the second individual; and causing the determined response to be executed.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the determined response includes an auditory response, and the causing of the determined response to be executed includes causing the auditory response to be rendered by the speaker.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the determining of the response to the communication is further based on at least one data source associated with at least one of the first individual and the second individual.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the determining of the response to the communication is performed utilizing a cognitive analysis.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the communication includes a voice communication.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the determined response includes an auditory response, and the causing of the determined response to be executed includes: causing the auditory response to be at least temporarily prevented from being rendered by the speaker; and causing a notification of the auditory response to be rendered by a computing device associated with the first individual.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving feedback from the first individual after the causing of the determined response to be executed; receiving a second communication from the first individual; and determining a second response to the second communication based on the second communication and the received feedback.
8. A system for managing a chatbot comprising: at least one processor that receives a communication from a first individual; detects the presence of a second individual within a proximity of a speaker; determines a response to the communication based on the communication and the detected presence of the second individual; and causes the determined response to be executed.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the determined response includes an auditory response, and the causing of the determined response to be executed includes causing the auditory response to be rendered by the speaker.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the determining of the response to the communication is further based on at least one data source associated with at least one of the first individual and the second individual.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the determining of the response to the communication is performed utilizing a cognitive analysis.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the communication includes a voice communication.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the determined response includes an auditory response, and the causing of the determined response to be executed includes: causing the auditory response to be at least temporarily prevented from being rendered by the speaker; and causing a notification of the auditory response to be rendered by a computing device associated with the first individual.
14. The system of claim 8, wherein the at least one processor further: receives feedback from the first individual after the causing of the determined response to be executed; receives a second communication from the first individual; and determines a second response to the second communication based on the second communication and the received feedback.
15. A computer program product for managing a chatbot by one or more processors, the computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable program code portions stored therein, the computer-readable program code portions comprising: an executable portion that receives a communication from a first individual; an executable portion that detects the presence of a second individual within a proximity of a speaker; an executable portion that determines a response to the communication based on the communication and the detected presence of the second individual; and an executable portion that causes the determined response to be executed.
16. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the determined response includes an auditory response, and the causing of the determined response to be executed includes causing the auditory response to be rendered by the speaker.
17. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the determining of the response to the communication is further based on at least one data source associated with at least one of the first individual and the second individual.
18. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the determining of the response to the communication is performed utilizing a cognitive analysis.
19. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the communication includes a voice communication.
20. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the determined response includes an auditory response, and the causing of the determined response to be executed includes: causing the auditory response to be at least temporarily prevented from being rendered by the speaker; and causing a notification of the auditory response to be rendered by a computing device associated with the first individual.
21. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the computer-readable program code portions further include: an executable portion that receives feedback from the first individual after the causing of the determined response to be executed; an executable portion that receives a second communication from the first individual; and an executable portion that determines a second response to the second communication based on the second communication and the received feedback.
