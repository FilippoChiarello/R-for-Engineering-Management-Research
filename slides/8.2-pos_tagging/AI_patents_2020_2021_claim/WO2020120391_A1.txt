<title>
A CLOUD PLATFORM AND METHOD FOR EFFICIENT PROCESSING OF POOLED DATA
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method for efficient processing of pooled data shared by users of a cloud platform (1), the method comprising the steps of uploading (S1) at least one dataset (DS) by a client device of a user to said cloud platform (1); calculating (S2) similarity scores indicating a degree of similarity between the current uploaded dataset (DS) and datasets (DS) previously uploaded by client devices of other users; and performing (S3) a procedure selected by a user on the cloud platform (1) based on pooled data including the current dataset (DS) of the respective user and the datasets (DS) previously uploaded from client devices of other users stored in a database (3) of the cloud platform (1) having calculated similarity scores in relation to the current uploaded dataset (DS) of the respective user exceeding a configurable similarity score threshold.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for efficient processing of pooled data shared by users of a cloud platform (1), the method comprising the steps of: uploading (SI) at least one dataset (DS) by a client device of a user to said cloud platform (1); calculating ( S2 ) similarity scores (SS) indicating a degree of similarity between the current uploaded dataset (DS) and datasets (DS) previously uploaded by client devices of other users; and performing (S3) a procedure selected by a user on the cloud platform (1) based on pooled data including the current dataset (DS) of the respective user and the datasets (DS) previously uploaded from client devices of other users stored in a database (3) of the cloud platform (1) having calculated similarity scores (SS) in relation to the current uploaded dataset (DS) of the respective user exceeding a configurable similarity score threshold (TH) , wherein the client device of a user having uploaded a current dataset (DS) on the cloud platform (1) receives a recommendation message (REC) from the cloud platform (1) to pool datasets (DS) of other users of the cloud platform (1) matching the current dataset (DS), and wherein the matching datasets (DS) are pooled automatically to generate a dataset (DS) pool if the cloud platform (1) receives an accept message (ACC) to pool datasets (DS) from the client device of the user .
2. The method according to claim 1 wherein the procedure performed by the cloud platform (1) comprises
a training procedure used for training a data model, a testing procedure used to test a trained data model and/or
an inference procedure used to execute a trained and tested data model.
3. The method according to claim 2 wherein the used data model comprises an artificial neural network, ANN.
4. The method according to any of the preceding claims 1 to
3 wherein for each uploaded dataset (DS) a representation vector is computed which comprises vector elements representing statistical properties of the uploaded dataset (DS) .
5. The method according to claim 4 wherein the similarity score indicating a degree of similarity between uploaded datasets (DS) is calculated based on the representation vectors of the uploaded datasets (DS) .
6. The method according to any of the preceding claims 1 to
5 wherein the calculated similarity score comprises a cosine similarity score.
7. The method according to any of the preceding claims 1 to
6 wherein if the similarity score calculated for a current uploaded dataset (DS) in relation to a previously uploaded dataset (DS) of another user exceeds a
configurable similarity score threshold, the respective previously uploaded and stored dataset (DS) is marked as a matching dataset (DS) with respect to the dataset (DS) currently uploaded by the client device of the user.
8. The method according to claim 7 wherein the pooled data comprises datasets (DS) uploaded from client devices of different users marked as matching datasets (DS) .
9. The method according to any of the preceding claims 1 to
8 wherein calculating similarity scores (SS) with respect to previously uploaded datasets (DS) of other users stored in a database (3) of said cloud platform (1) is triggered in response to uploading a new current dataset (DS) from the client device of the respective user.
10. The method according to any of the preceding claims 7 to
9 wherein matching datasets (DS) undergo homomorphic encryption before they are pooled to generate the dataset (DS) pool.
11. The method according to claim 10 wherein the procedure selected by the user is performed on the cloud platform (1) both on the basis of the generated dataset (DS) pool and on the basis of the current dataset (DS) uploaded by the client device of the user on the cloud platform (1) to calculate a benchmark indicating an efficiency
increase in processing the uploaded dataset (DS) by the selected procedure caused by data pooling.
12. The method according to claim 11 wherein the calculated benchmark is sent by the cloud platform (1) to the client device of the user.
13. The method according to any of the preceding claims 1 to 12 wherein the datasets (DS) comprise labelled data and/or unlabelled data.
14. A cloud platform used for efficient processing of pooled data shared by users of the cloud platform (1),
the cloud platform (1) comprising a database (3) adapted to store datasets (DS) uploaded to the cloud platform (1) by client devices of the users;
a score calculation unit (2A) configured to calculate similarity scores (SS) each indicating a degree of similarity between a currently uploaded dataset (DS) and previously uploaded datasets (DS) stored in said database (3); and
a processor (2B) adapted to execute a procedure selected by a user based on pooled data including the current uploaded dataset (DS) of the respective user and previously uploaded datasets (DS) of other users having calculated similarity scores (SS) in relation to the currently uploaded dataset (DS) of the
respective user exceeding a configurable similarity threshold (TH) , wherein the client device of a user having uploaded a current dataset (DS) on the cloud platform (1) receives a recommendation message (REC) from the cloud platform (1) to pool datasets (DS) of other users of the cloud platform (1) matching the current dataset (DS), and wherein the matching datasets (DS) are pooled
automatically to generate a dataset (DS) pool if the cloud platform (1) receives an accept message (ACC) to pool datasets (DS) from the client device of the user .
