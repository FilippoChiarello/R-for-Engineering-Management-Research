<title>
Network anomaly detection and network performance status determination
</title>

<abstract>
A system may collect, from a wireless network, first data pertaining to nodes in the wireless network. Each datum of the first data belongs to one of two or more categories/For each of the nodes, for each of the categories, and for each datum belonging to the category, the system may determine if the datum is outside of a first range of values, and if the datum is inside the first range, the system may calculate a first base network performance health (NPH) score that is a function of the nodes, the categories, the data, and time. The system may also apply first deep learning to a first neural network among a plurality of neural networks to update first coefficients for correlating the first base NPH score to a mean opinion score, for each of the categories.

3. The device of claim 1, wherein each datum of the first data belongs to one of a plurality of categories, and wherein the categories include at least one of: service availability, service integrity, service accessibility, mobility, or retainability.
4. The device of claim 1, wherein the one node includes a base station.
5. The device of claim 1, wherein when the one or more processors calculate the first base NPH score, the one or more processors are to: determine if the datum is inside a range where at least about 50% of the first data is found; and set a first base NPH score, among the first base NPH scores, to a predetermined value if the datum is not in the range.
6. The device of claim 1, wherein the plurality of neural networks include convolutional neural networks.
7. The device of claim 1, wherein each datum of the first data is associated with one of a plurality of time intervals, and wherein each of the time intervals is about one hour to 24 hours.
8. The device of claim 1, wherein when the one or more processors perform learning, the one or more processors are to: determine a cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the first data; obtain an area under a curve for the CDF over a first range; and normalize the area under the curve by dividing the area under the curve by an area under the curve of the CDF computed over a second range.
9. The device of claim 1, wherein when the one or more processors calculate the first NPH score, the one or more processors are to: determine whether increasing a value of the datum improves performance of the wireless network or decreasing the value of the datum improves performance of the wireless network.
