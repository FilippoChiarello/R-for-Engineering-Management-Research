<claims>
1. An information technology platform for personalizing an experience of a visitor at a non-profit venue, the platform comprising: a network; a server in communication with the network; a mobile computing device to be carried by a visitor to a non-profit venue, the mobile computing device in communication with the server via the network, wherein an information technology platform determines personalized information about the visitor; and a recommendation engine associated with the server, wherein the recommendation engine is to receive the personalized information about the visitor and to output a suggestion for a personalized experience for the visitor, wherein the information technology platform conveys the suggestion for the personalized experience to the mobile computing device of the visitor, wherein the personalized experience is to encourage philanthropic activity; and a ticketing system to generate credentials for authorizing entry of the visitor into the non-profit venue, wherein the generated credentials are selected based in part on a stored association between a datum among the personalized information about the visitor and a non-profit venue location for which the generated credentials authorize entry.
2. The information technology platform of claim 1, wherein the credentials are selected from a group consisting of passcodes, tangible media tokens, E-tickets, mobile tickets, biometric data, behavioral data and combinations thereof.
3. The information technology platform of claim 1, wherein the mobile tickets are selected from a group consisting of a mobile barcode, a QR code, an Aztec barcode, Near Field Communication (NFC), Bluetooth low energy and combinations thereof.
4. The information technology platform of claim 1, wherein the credentials are delivered to the visitor via mail, e-mail, text message, or a mobile application.
5. The information technology platform of claim 1, wherein the credentials are presented to the information technology platform by transferring a tangible media token, electronic communication, display, biological presence or behavioral manifestation of the visitor.
6. The information technology platform of claim 2, wherein the biometric data is selected from the group consisting of a biological image; a fingerprint; genetic data; a palm print; palm veins; an iris image; a retina image; a scent; heart rhythm; and voice data.
7. The information technology platform of claim 2, wherein the behavioral data is selected from the group consisting of a gesture, typing rhythm, gait and combinations thereof.
8. The information technology platform of claim 1, further comprising a mobile application for accessing the information technology platform by the visitor or by a prospective visitor.
9. The information technology platform of claim 1, further comprising a web client for accessing the information technology platform by the visitor or by a prospective visitor.
10. The information technology platform of claim 1, further comprising an application programming interface.
11. The information technology platform of claim 1, further comprising a software development kit for creating applications for the platform.
12. A system for reducing a wait time for a visitor of a non-profit venue, comprising: a mobile application module operating on a first mobile computing device carried by a visitor that communicates with one or more wireless beacons or tracking systems proximate to a non-profit venue while the visitor is at least one of traveling to the non-profit venue and queueing to enter the non-profit venue; a provisioning module, operating on a second mobile computing device, for activating a portable digital guide; an entry module, operating on the second mobile computing device, for identifying and checking in visitors; and a notification module, operating on the second mobile computing device, for notifying a non-profit venue worker, wherein the notification module is to automatically notify the provisioning module to provision an available digital guide by pre-filling the available digital guide with personalized visitor information, and to notify at least one of the non-profit venue workers to retrieve the digital guide and to meet the visitor at an entry location where the visitor is expected to enter the non-profit venue.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the non-profit venue is at least one of a museum and a zoo.
14. The system of claim 12, wherein the notification module is to provide the non-profit venue worker with an image of the visitor and a name of the visitor, a coordinate of where the visitor is expected to enter the non-profit venue, and at least one of a travel speed of the visitor and an estimated time of arrival of the visitor at the coordinate.
15. The system of claim 12, wherein the tracking system includes a Radio Frequency (RF) beacon, an access point, an Indoor Positioning System (IPS), a Global Positioning System (GPS), a local proximity detection system, a Quick Response (QR) code scanning system, or an image recognition system.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the local proximity detection system includes at least one of a Near-Field Communication (NFC) system, a Wi-Fi system, an RF system, a cellular system, an Internet of Things (IoT) system, and a Bluetooth system.
