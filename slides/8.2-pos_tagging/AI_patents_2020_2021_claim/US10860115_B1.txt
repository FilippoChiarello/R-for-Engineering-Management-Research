<abstract>
A method for transporting people by providing a vehicle with a cab having a moveable actuator coupled to the propulsion unit to move the propulsion unit between a first position above the cab during lift-off and a second position during lateral flight; determining a hand control gesture as captured by a plurality of cameras or sensors in the vehicle, wherein a sequence of finger, palm or hand movements represents a vehicle control request; and determining vehicle control options based on the model, a current state of the vehicle and the environment of the vehicle.

<claims>
1. A method for transporting people, comprising providing a vehicle with a cab having a moveable actuator coupled to the propulsion unit to move the propulsion unit between a first position above the cab during lift-off and a second position during lateral flight; determining a hand control gesture as captured by a plurality of cameras or sensors in the vehicle, wherein a sequence of finger, palm or hand movements represents a vehicle control request; and determining vehicle control options based on the model, a current state of the vehicle and the environment of the vehicle.
2. The method of claim 1, comprising, based on LIDAR, radar, and camera images, generating 3D models for navigation purposes.
3. The method of claim 1, comprising crowd-sourcing 3D models and generating a high resolution 3D map of the region above the ground is generated.
4. The method of claim 1, comprising generating a multi-dimensional model of a vehicle operating in a 3D environment.
5. The method of claim 1, comprising determining a hand control gesture as captured by a plurality of cameras or sensors in the vehicle.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein a sequence of finger, palm or hand movements represents a vehicle control request.
7. The method of claim 1, comprising determining vehicle control options based on the model, a current state of the vehicle and the environment of the vehicle; and controlling the vehicle to operate based on the model and the 3D environment.
8. The method of claim 1, comprising mapping system for an air space includes a plurality of air vehicles each having a plurality of environmental sensors; communicating with an edge processor in at least one vehicle or in at least one communication tower to receive sensor data and create a 3D model of the air space from successive air vehicle sensor outputs.
9. The method of claim 1, comprising providing processors and sensor located on 5G towers provide low latency edge processing capability, including machine learning processors to minimize cost of vehicle.
10. The method of claim 1, comprising slice processing the network to provide dedicated communications between vehicles.
11. The method of claim 1, comprising traveling over land or water in the cab.
12. The method of claim 1, comprising providing moveable wings on the cab.
13. The method of claim 1, comprising performing navigation using distributed processing.
14. The method of claim 13, comprising distributing flight path computation among cloud processor, edge processor, and on-board processor.
15. The method of claim 1, comprising coupling the cab to a rail track and pulling the cab to a destination.
16. The method of claim 1, comprising providing autonomous navigation for the vehicle.
17. The method of claim 1, comprising coupling a balloon to the vehicle and changing altitude by heating or cooling air to the balloon.
18. The method of claim 1, comprising providing a docking station that charges the vehicle.
19. The method of claim 1, comprising providing renewable fuel for the vehicle.
20. The method of claim 1, comprising receiving an instruction from an air traffic controller computer, modifying a flight plan according to the instruction or according to computer vision detection of a local obstacle.
