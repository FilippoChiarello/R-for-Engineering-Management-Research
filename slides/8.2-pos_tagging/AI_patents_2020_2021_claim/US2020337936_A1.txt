METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING INFORMATION TO A USER
</title>

<abstract>
A method for providing information to a user, preferably including: determining environmental information; determining a set of features based on the information; determining output parameters based on the features; and controlling a sensory output system to generate outputs based on the output parameters. A sensory output device, preferably including a plurality of sensory output actuators. A system for providing information to a user, preferably including one or more: sensory output devices, sensors, and computing systems.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for providing information to a user, the method comprising: determining a user location and a user orientation of the user; determining a first position of a first object relative to the user; determining a second position of a second object relative to the user; wherein at least one of the first position and the second position is further determined based on at least one of the user location and the user orientation; at a tactile output device comprising a first plurality and a second plurality of tactile actuators: determining a first set of control instructions based on the first position; determining a second set of control instructions based on the second position; controlling actuation of the first plurality of actuators based on the first set of control instructions; and controlling actuation the second plurality of actuators based on the second set of control instruction.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein controlling actuation of the second plurality of actuators is performed substantially concurrently with controlling actuation of the first plurality of actuators.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the first object is an inanimate object and the second object is a person.
4. The method, wherein the first position is determined based on a first sensor and wherein the second position is determined based on a second sensor separate and distinct from the first sensor.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the second position is determined based on the user location and the user orientation.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the second sensor is not mechanically coupled to the user.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the first sensor is mechanically coupled to the user.
8. A system for providing information to a user, the system comprising: a first sensor configured to be mechanically coupled to the user, wherein the first sensor samples a first measurement indicative of a first position of a first object; a tactile output device configured to be mechanically coupled to the user, wherein the tactile output device comprises: a first plurality of tactile actuators associated with the first sensor and controlled based on a first set of control instructions, the first set of control instructions determined based on the first position; a second plurality of tactile actuators associated with a second sensor and controlled based on a second set of control instructions; and a controller configured to control actuation of the first plurality of tactile actuators based on the first set of control instructions and to control actuation of the second plurality of tactile actuators based on the second set of control instructions, wherein the controller is in communication with at least the first sensor and the second sensor.
8. system of claim 8, wherein the second sensor is arranged remote from the user.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the first sensor is an optical sensor.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the first sensor is mechanically coupled to the tactile output device.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the second sensor is coupled to a user device of a second user.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the second sensor samples a second measurement indicative of a second location of a second object.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein a second position of the second object is determined based on the second location, a user location, and a user orientation, wherein the second set of control instructions is determined based on the second position.
15. The system of claim 8, wherein the first set of control instructions prescribes actuation of at least a first tactile actuator of the first plurality of tactile actuators based on the first position of the first object, wherein the first object is closer to the first tactile actuator than to any other tactile actuator of the first plurality of tactile actuators.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the second set of control instructions prescribes actuation of at least a second tactile actuator of the second plurality of tactile actuators based on a second position of a second object, wherein the second object is closer to the second tactile actuator than to any other tactile actuator of the second plurality of tactile actuators.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein the first object is an inanimate object.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the second object is a person.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein the second sensor is coupled to a user device of the person.
20. The system of claim 8, further comprising a processing system in communication with the tactile output device, wherein the processing system determines the first and second sets of control instructions.
21. The system of claim 8, wherein: the first set of control instructions prescribes actuation of a first tactile actuator of the first plurality of tactile actuators, the first object closer to the first tactile actuator than to any other tactile actuator of the first plurality; and the second set of control instructions prescribes actuation of a second tactile actuator of the second plurality of tactile actuators, the second object closer to the second tactile actuator than to any other tactile actuator of the second plurality.
