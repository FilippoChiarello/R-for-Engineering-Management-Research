CIRCULATING TUMOR CELL DIAGNOSTICS FOR LUNG CANCER
</title>

<abstract>
The invention provides a method for diagnosing lung cancer in a subject, the method comprising: (a) generating circulating tumor cell (CTC) data from a blood sample obtained from the subject based on a direct analysis of CTCs detected in the context of surrounding nucleated cells present in the sample in the absence of enrichment of the CTCs prior to detection, comprising immunofluorescent staining and morphological characteristics of nucleated cells in said sample, wherein CTCs are identified in the context of surrounding nucleated cells based on a combination of said immunofluorescent staining and morphological characteristics; (b) obtaining clinical data for said subject; and (c) combining said CTC data with said clinical data to diagnose lung cancer in said subject.

<claims>
1. A method for diagnosing lung cancer in a subject, the method comprising: (a) generating circulating tumor cell (CTC) data from a blood sample obtained from the subject based on a direct analysis of CTCs detected in the context of surrounding nucleated cells present in the sample in the absence of enrichment of the CTCs prior to detection, comprising immunofluorescent staining and morphological characteristics of nucleated cells in said sample, wherein CTCs are identified in the context of surrounding nucleated cells based on a combination of said immunofluorescent staining and morphological characteristics; (b) obtaining clinical data for said subject; and (c) combining said CTC data with said clinical data to diagnose lung cancer in said subj ect.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein said clinical data comprises one or more pieces of imaging data,
optionally wherein said imaging data is generated comprising a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) scan, optionally wherein said PET/CT is a 2-[18]-F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET/CT (FDG PET/CT),
optionally wherein said one or more pieces of imaging data are selected from maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), maximum lesion diameter and lesion location.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein said clinical data comprises one or more individual risk factors,
optionally wherein said one or more individual risk factors are selected from age, gender, ethnicity, cancer history, and smoking status.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein said lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), optionally wherein said NSCLC is Stage I NSCLC.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the CTC data is generated by fluorescent scanning microscopy.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the CTC data is generated by assessing at least 4 million of said nucleated cells; or
wherein said microscopy provides a field of view comprising both CTCs and more than 200 surrounding white blood cells (WBCs).
7. The method of claim 5, wherein said immunofluorescent staining of nucleated cells comprises pan cytokeratin, cluster of differentiation (CD) 45 and diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI); or
wherein said CTCs comprise distinct immunofluorescent staining from surrounding nucleated cells, optionally wherein said distinct immunofluorescent staining comprises DAPI (+), CK (+) and CD 45 (-) .
8. The method of claim 1, wherein said CTCs comprise distinct morphological characteristics compared to surrounding nucleated cells,
optionally wherein said morphological characteristics comprise one or more of the group consisting of nucleus size, nucleus shape, cell size, cell shape and nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio,
optionally wherein said morphological characteristics further comprise one or more of nuclear detail, nuclear contour, presence or absence of nucleoli, quality of cytoplasm and quantity of cytoplasm.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein said identification of CTCs further comprises comparing intensity of pan cytokeratin fluorescent staining to surrounding nucleated cells.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising an initial step of obtaining a white blood cell (WBC) count for the blood sample; or
further comprising an initial step of lysing erythrocytes in the blood sample.
11. The method of claim 1, further comprising an initial step of depositing nucleated cells from the blood sample as a monolayer on a glass slide;
optionally depositing between about 2 million and about 3 million cells onto said glass slide.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the generation of said CTC data comprises enumeration of CTCs in the blood sample, optionally wherein: a positive diagnosis of lung cancer comprises detection of at least 7.5 CTCs/mL of blood; or the generation of said CTC data comprises detecting CTC clusters, optionally wherein a positive diagnosis of lung cancer comprises detection of one or more CTC clusters.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein said CTC data and said clinical data comprise measurable features,
optionally wherein said measurable features are analyzed using a predictive model.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein said analysis comprises logistic regression, optionally wherein: the diagnosis is expressed as a risk score; or said method has a diagnostic accuracy comprising an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of at least about 0.88, preferably wherein the AUROC is at least 0.94.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein said subject is a high risk subject.
