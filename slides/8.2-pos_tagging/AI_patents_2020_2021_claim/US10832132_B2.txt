Data transmission method and calculation apparatus for neural network, electronic apparatus, computer-readable storage medium and computer program product
</title>

<abstract>
Provided are a data transmission method for a neural network, and a related product. The method includes the following steps: acquiring a weight specification of weight data stored in a memory, comparing the weight specification with a specification of a write memory in terms of size and determining a comparison result; according to the comparison result, dividing the write memory into a first-in first-out write memory and a multiplexing write memory; according to the comparison result, determining data reading policies of the first-in first-out write memory and the multiplexing write memory; and according to the data reading policies, reading weights from the first-in first-out write memory and the multiplexing write memory and loading the weights to a calculation circuit. The technical solution provided by the present application has the advantages of low power consumption and short calculation time.
