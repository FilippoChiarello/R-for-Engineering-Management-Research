IMAGE PROCESSING APPARATUS AND IMAGE PROCESSING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided an image processing apparatus which includes a voice recognition section that recognizes a voice uttered by a user, a motion recognition section that recognizes a motion of the user, a text object control section that disposes an object of text representative of the contents of the voice in a three-dimensional virtual space, and varies text by implementing interaction based on the motion, and an image generation section that displays an image with the three-dimensional virtual space projected thereon.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An image processing apparatus comprising: a voice recognition section that recognizes a voice uttered by a user; a motion recognition section that recognizes a motion of the user; a text object control section that disposes an object of text representative of the contents of the voice in a three-dimensional virtual space, and varies text by implementing interaction based on the motion; and an image generation section that displays an image with the three-dimensional virtual space projected thereon.
2. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein in accordance with a voice uttered or a motion made while the object of text in a virtual space is touched by the user, the text object control section corrects or deletes the text.
3. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein in accordance with a motion of pinching the object of text in a virtual space and turning the object of text over, the text object control section corrects the text.
4. The image processing apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the text object control section changes corrected text in accordance with the combination of fingers pinching the object of text in a virtual space.
5. The image processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the text object control section varies the type of correction in accordance with the orientation of a finger touching the object of text in a virtual space.
6. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the text object control section disposes an object of an emoticon in the virtual space in accordance with a user's motion of placing a user's face in the virtual space.
7. The image processing apparatus according to claim 6, wherein the text object control section causes the emoticon to reflect a user's facial expression at the beginning of the user's motion of placing the user's face in the virtual space.
8. The image processing apparatus according to claim 6, wherein in accordance with a voice uttered or a motion made while the object of the emoticon is touched by the user, the text object control section corrects the facial expression of the emoticon.
9. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein in accordance with a user's gesture made simultaneously with voice utterance, the text object control section determines the type of text to be presented as an object.
10. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein in accordance with a user's gesture, the text object control section adds an object representative of a corresponding code to the object of text.
11. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the text object control section presents, as the object of text, only a voice uttered while the user is making a predetermined gesture.
12. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a communication section that, in accordance with an operation of transmitting a text string presented as the object, transmits data on the text string to a communication partner, wherein the text object control section moves the object of the transmitted text string to a predetermined location in the virtual space.
13. The image processing apparatus according to claim 12, wherein in accordance with a user's motion made or a user's voice uttered with respect to the object of the text string, the text object control section requests the communication section to transmit data on the text string.
14. The image processing apparatus according to claim 12, wherein in accordance with a user's motion of pulling back a moved object of a text string, the text object control section requests the communication section to cancel the transmission of data on the text string.
15. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the image generation section displays both an image of content and an image formed by the projection, and in accordance with priority levels retained for different pieces of the content, the text object control section determines text to be presented as the object.
16. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein in accordance with the priority levels learned from the results of previous text conversion by a plurality of users, the text object control section determines text to be presented as the object.
17. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the motion recognition section recognizes the motion in accordance with an image acquired from, at least one of a visible-light camera, a multispectral camera, and a depth camera or with a value measured by a sensor worn by a user.
18. The image processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a haptic control section that causes a haptic device worn by a user to present a haptic stimulus corresponding to a user's motion with respect to the object.
19. An image processing method used by an image processing apparatus, the image processing method comprising: recognizing a voice uttered by a user; recognizing a motion of the user; disposing an object of text representative of the contents of the voice in a three-dimensional virtual space; causing a display apparatus to display an image with the three-dimensional virtual space projected thereon; and varying the text by implementing interaction with the object in accordance with the motion.
20. A program for a computer, comprising: by a voice recognition section, recognizing a voice uttered by a user; by a motion recognition section, recognizing a motion of the user; by a text object control section, disposing an object of text representative of the contents of the voice in a three-dimensional virtual space and varying the text by implementing interaction in accordance with the motion; and by an image generation section, displaying an image with the three-dimensional virtual space projected thereon.
