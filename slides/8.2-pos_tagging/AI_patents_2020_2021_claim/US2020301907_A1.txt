ASSISTANCE APPARATUS, ASSISTANCE METHOD, AND RECORDING MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide a technology which assists a verifying party in ascertaining an anomaly in an event of which notification has been made. Provided is an assistance device, comprising: an acquisition unit which acquires as an associated event, from among events which take place among a plurality of elements, and with respect to elements which have been associated with an event which has been detected as an anomalous event, an event other than the anomalous event which has been associated with the elements; and a generating unit which, on the basis of the anomalous event and the associated event, generates a relational graph in which the elements are vertices, the relations among the elements are edges, the anomalous event and the associated event are respectively represented, and the associated event is displayed in a display screen in a different manner from the manner in which the anomalous event is displayed.

<claims>
1. An assistance apparatus comprising: one or more processors forming acquisition unit which acquires, for an element related to an event detected as an anomalous event among events between a plurality of elements, an event that is related to the element and is different from the anomalous event, as a related event; and generation unit which generates, based on the anomalous event and the related event, a relational graph that has the element as a vertex and a relation between the elements as a side and represents each of the anomalous event and the related event, in which the related event is displayed on a display screen in a mode different from a mode of the anomalous event.
2. The assistance apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising acceptance unit which accepts an input of a display condition, wherein the acquisition unit acquires, for an element related to an anomalous event that matches the display condition, the related event related to the element.
3. The assistance apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising acceptance unit which accepts an input of a display condition, wherein the generation unit generates the relational graph representing the anomalous event that matches the display condition and the related event.
4. The assistance apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the acquisition unit acquires, for an element included between an element related to the anomalous event and a related element within a predetermined number of hops, an event related to the element as the related event.
5. The assistance apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the acquisition unit acquires, as the related event, every event related to at least one of a plurality of elements related to the anomalous event.
6. The assistance apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the acquisition unit acquires, as the related event, a predetermined number of events chosen in an order in which the event occurrence time is new, or a predetermined number of events chosen in descending order of number of occurrences out of events that occur in a certain past time period, among events related to at least one of a plurality of elements related to the anomalous event.
7. The assistance apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the acquisition unit acquires, for a related element related to an element of the anomalous event, an event related to the related element as the related event.
8. The assistance apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising detection means for detecting unit which detects the anomalous event.
9. The assistance apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising display unit that includes the display screen and displays the relational graph on the display screen.
10. An assistance method executed by one or more processors comprising: acquiring, for an element related to an event detected as an anomalous event among events between a plurality of elements, an event that is related to the element and is different from the anomalous event, as a related event; and generating, based on the anomalous event and the related event, a relational graph that has the element as a vertex and a relation between the elements as a side and represents each of the anomalous event and the related event, in which the related event is displayed on a display screen in a mode different from a mode of the anomalous event.
11. The assistance method according to claim 10, further comprising: accepting an input of a display condition; and, when acquiring the related event, acquiring, for an element related to an anomalous event that matches the display condition, the related event related to the element.
12. The assistance method according to claim 10, further comprising: accepting an input of a display condition; and generating the relational graph representing the anomalous event that matches the display condition and the related event.
13. A computer-readable non-transitory recording medium on which a program is recorded, the program causing a computer to execute: a process of acquiring, for an element related to an event detected as an anomalous event among events between a plurality of elements, an event that is related to the elements and is different from the anomalous event, as a related event; and a process of generating, based on the anomalous event and the related event, a relational graph that has the element as a vertex and a relation between the elements as a side and represents each of the anomalous event and the related event, in which the related event is displayed on a display screen in a mode different from a mode of the anomalous event.
14. The recording medium according to claim 13 on which a program is recorded, the program causing the computer to further execute a process of accepting an input of a display condition, wherein the process of acquiring acquires, for an element related to an anomalous event that matches the display condition, the related event related to the element.
15. The recording medium according to claim 13 on which a program is recorded, the program causing the computer to further execute a process of accepting an input of a display condition, wherein the process of generating generates the relational graph representing the anomalous event that matches the display condition and the related event.
