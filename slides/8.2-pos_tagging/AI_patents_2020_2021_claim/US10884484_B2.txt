<title>
Extending a battery life of a battery-powered computing device
</title>

<abstract>
In some examples, in a battery-powered computing device, a software monitor may access a calendar, determine that an event is occurring, determine that the event has an associated profile, and configure the computing device based on the profile to reduce a power consumption of the computing device. For example, one or more hardware components and one or more software components identified in the profile may be placed in a low power consumption state. For example, a hardware component may be transitioned from a power-on state to a low-power state power or may not be provided power. As another example, execution of a software component may be stopped or an execution priority of the software component may be modified from a first priority to a second priority that is lower than the first priority.
