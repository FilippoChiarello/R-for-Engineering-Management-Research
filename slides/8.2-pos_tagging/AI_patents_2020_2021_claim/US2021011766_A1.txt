<title>
Predictive System Resource Allocation
</title>

<abstract>
A system may include a processing unit; a storage device comprising instructions, which when executed by the processing unit, configure the processing unit to perform operations comprising: retrieving a meeting count of meetings scheduled during a future time period; generating a predicted usage level of a service during the future time period based on the meeting count; determining a resource modification for the service based on the predicted usage level; and implementing the resource modification prior to the future time period.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system comprising: a processing unit; a storage device comprising instructions, which when executed by the processing unit, configure the processing unit to perform operations comprising: retrieving a meeting count of meetings scheduled during a future time period; generating a predicted usage level of a service during the future time period based on the meeting count; determining a resource modification for the service based on the predicted usage level; and implementing the resource modification prior to the future lime period.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the resource modification is an increase or decrease in computing resources allocated to the service.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the resource modification is a cache refresh.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the operation of retrieving the meeting count of meetings scheduled during the future time period includes retrieving a number of non-recurring meetings for an entity.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the operations further include, receiving a request to generate the predicted usage level for a geographic area.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein retrieving the meeting count of meetings scheduled during the future time period includes retrieving the meeting count of meetings scheduled by users of the service in the geographic area.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the predicted usage level is based on historical usage levels for the service correlated with the count.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the predicted usage level includes an expected number of unique devices connected to the service during the future time period.
9. A method comprising: retrieving a meeting count of meetings scheduled during a future time period; generating a predicted usage level of a service during the future time period based on the meeting count; determining a resource modification for the service based on the predicted usage level; and implementing the resource modification prior to the future time period.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the resource modification is an increase or decrease in computing resources allocated to the service.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the resource modification is a cache refresh.
12. The method of claim 9, wherein the operation of retrieving the meeting count of meetings scheduled during the future time period includes retrieving a number of non-recurring meetings for an entity.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein the operations further include, receiving a request to generate the predicted usage level for a geographic area.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein retrieving the meeting count of meetings scheduled during the future time period includes retrieving the meeting count of meetings scheduled by users of the service in the geographic area.
15. The method of claim 9, wherein the predicted usage level is based on historical usage levels for the service correlated with the count.
16. The method of claim 9, wherein the predicted usage level includes an expected number of unique devices connected to the service during the future time period.
17. A storage device comprising instructions, which when executed by at least one processor, configure the at least one processor to perform operations including: retrieving a meeting count of meetings scheduled during a future time period; generating a predicted usage level of a service during the future time period based on the meeting count; determining a resource modification for the service based on the predicted usage level; and implementing the resource modification prior to the future time period.
18. The storage device of claim 17, wherein the resource modification is an increase or decrease in computing resources allocated to the service.
19. The storage device of claim 17, wherein the resource modification is a cache refresh.
20. The storage device of claim 17, wherein the operation of retrieving the meeting count of meetings scheduled during the future time period includes retrieving a number of non-recurring meetings for an entity.
