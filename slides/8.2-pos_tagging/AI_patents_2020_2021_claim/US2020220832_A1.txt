CONTENT EVALUATION
</title>

<abstract>
Evaluating messaging content on a computer-based communications network includes classifying, using computer hardware, a response to a message previously rated by a user. The message, the response to the message, and the rating by the user can each be provided on the computer-based communications network. Evaluating messaging content also includes automatically changing, with the computer hardware, the rating of the message when the classifying of the response results in a classification that satisfies a predefined rating change condition.

<claims>
That which is claimed is:
1. A method, comprising: classifying, using computer hardware, a response to a message previously rated by a user, wherein the message, the response to the message, and rating by the user are provided on a communications network; and automatically changing, with the computer hardware, the rating of the message when the classifying results in a classification that satisfies a predefined rating change condition.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the response comprises one of a comment on the message and a modification of content of the message, and wherein the changing comprises one of cancelling the rating provided by the user and reversing the rating provided by the user.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the classifying comprises extracting content from the response and assigning extracted content to a predefined category, and wherein the change condition is satisfied when the category matches a user-specified change category.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising providing the rating by the user in response to a similar rating being provided by a third-party designated by the user as a trusted party.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the rating provided by the user is based on an earlier-provided reserved rating provided by the user.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising analyzing a comment on the rated message and sending via the communication network a notification to a third-party notifying the third-party that adding the comment to a message stream including the rated message will cancel at least one prior rating of the message.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising determining a number of messages that adding the comment will cancel and preventing adding the comment in response to determining that the number exceeds a predetermined threshold.
8. A system, comprising: at least one processor programmed to initiate executable operations, the executable operations including: classifying a response to a message previously rated by a user, wherein the message, the response to the message, and rating by the user are provided on a communications network; and automatically changing the rating of the message when the classifying results in a classification that satisfies a predefined rating change condition.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the response comprises one of a comment on the message and a modification of content of the message, and wherein the changing comprises one of cancelling the rating provided by the user and reversing the rating provided by the user.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the classifying comprises extracting content from the response and assigning extracted content to a predefined category, and wherein the change condition is satisfied when the category matches a user-specified change category.
11. The system of claim 8, further comprising providing the rating by the user in response to a similar rating being provided by a third-party designated by the user as a trusted party.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the rating provided by the user is based on an earlier-provided reserved rating provided by the user.
13. The system of claim 8, further comprising analyzing a comment on the rated message and sending via the communication network a notification to a third-party notifying the third-party that adding the comment to a message stream including the rated message will cancel at least one prior rating of the message.
14. A computer program product, comprising: a computer-readable storage medium having program code stored thereon, the program code executable by computer hardware to initiate operations including: classifying a response to a message previously rated by a user, wherein the message, the response to the message, and rating by the user are provided on a communications network; and automatically changing the rating of the message when the classifying results in a classification that satisfies a predefined rating change condition.
15. The computer program product of claim 14, wherein the response comprises one of a comment on the message and a modification of content of the message, and wherein the changing comprises one of cancelling the rating provided by the user and reversing the rating provided by the user.
16. The computer program product of claim 14, wherein the classifying comprises extracting content from the response and assigning extracted content to a predefined category, and wherein the change condition is satisfied when the category matches a user-specified change category.
17. The computer program product of claim 14, further comprising providing the rating by the user in response to a similar rating being provided by a third-party designated by the user as a trusted party.
18. The computer program product of claim 17, wherein the rating provided by the user is based on an earlier-provided reserved rating provided by the user.
19. The computer program product of claim 14, further comprising analyzing a comment on the rated message and sending via the communication network a notification to a third-party notifying the third-party that adding the comment to a message stream including the rated message will cancel at least one prior rating of the message.
20. The computer program product of claim 19, further comprising determining a number of messages that adding the comment will cancel and preventing adding the comment in response to determining that the number exceeds a predetermined threshold.
