DIABETIC RETINOPATHY RECOGNITION SYSTEM BASED ON FUNDUS IMAGE
</title>

<abstract>
Some embodiments of the disclosure provide a diabetic retinopathy recognition system (S) based on fundus image. According to an embodiment, the system includes an image acquisition apparatus (1) configured to collect fundus images. The fundus images include target fundus images and reference fundus images taken from a person. The system further includes an automatic recognition apparatus (2) configured to process the fundus images from the image acquisition apparatus by using a deep learning method. The automatic recognition apparatus automatically determines whether a fundus image has a lesion and outputs the diagnostic result. According to another embodiment, the diabetic retinopathy recognition system (S) utilizes a deep learning method to automatically determine the fundus images and output the diagnostic result.

<claims>
1. A diabetic retinopathy recognition system, comprising: an image acquisition apparatus configured to collect fundus images, the fundus images comprise target fundus images and reference fundus images taken from a person; and an automatic recognition apparatus configured to process the fundus images from the image acquisition apparatus by using a deep learning method, and automatically determine whether a fundus image has a lesion and output a diagnostic result.
2. The diabetic retinopathy recognition system of claim 1, further comprising an output apparatus that outputs an analysis report according to the diagnostic result.
3. The diabetic retinopathy recognition system of claim 1, wherein the image acquisition apparatus is a handheld fundus camera.
4. The diabetic retinopathy recognition system of claim 1, wherein the automatic recognition apparatus is arranged in a cloud server, and the image acquisition apparatus interacts with the automatic recognition apparatus based on network communication.
5. The diabetic retinopathy recognition system of claim 1, wherein the automatic recognition apparatus comprises: a pre-processing module configured to separately pre-process the target fundus images and the reference fundus images; a first neural network configured to generate a first advanced feature set from the target fundus images; a second neural network configured to generate a second advanced feature set from the reference fundus images; a feature combination module configured to combine the first advanced feature set and the second advanced feature set to form a feature combination set; and a third neural network configured to generate a diagnosis result of lesions according to the feature combination set.
6. The diabetic retinopathy recognition system of claim 5, wherein the target fundus images and the reference fundus images are the same.
7. The diabetic retinopathy recognition system of claim 5, wherein the target fundus images and the reference fundus images are fundus images of different eyes.
8. The diabetic retinopathy recognition system of claim 5, wherein the first neural network and the second neural network are the same.
9. The diabetic retinopathy recognition system of claim 5, wherein the pre-processing module comprises: an area detection unit configured to detect designated fundus areas in the target fundus images and the reference fundus images; an adjustment unit configured to clip and resize the target fundus images and the reference fundus images; and a normalization unit configured to normalize the target fundus images and the reference fundus images.
10. The diabetic retinopathy recognition system of claim 5, wherein the third neural network generates the diagnosis result of lesions based on the feature combination set and patient information.
