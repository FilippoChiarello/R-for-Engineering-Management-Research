<title>
Intelligent Normalization and De-Normalization of Tables for Multiple Processing Scenarios
</title>

<abstract>
A method, system and computer-usable medium are disclosed for finding vertically and horizontally aligned cells in a complex table structure. A file or document, such as an HTML file that defines a complex table includes spanning rows and columns is expanded into a two dimensional (2D) array or table with orthogonal rows and columns, where the spanning rows and columns included cells with copied values or object references. The expanded 2D array or table can be deduplicated row or column wise to determine header alignment of the table.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method to find vertically and horizontally aligned cells in a structure data, comprising: creating a two dimensional (2D) array from the structure data that includes orthogonal rows and columns of cells with object references; determining spanning rows and columns in the 2D array; and copying the object references of adjacent cells in the spanning rows and columns to create an expanded table with spanning rows and columns.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein: the structure data is an HTML file representing a table.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein: the object references defines vertical and horizontal alignment in the structure data.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein: the cells include header values.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: deduplicating the expanded table with spanning rows and columns, based on row features, to create a deduplicated table for header cell detection.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: deduplicating the expanded table with spanning rows and columns, based on column features, to create a deduplicated table for header cell detection.
7. A system comprising: a processor; a data bus coupled to the processor; and a computer-usable medium embodying computer program code, the computer-usable medium being coupled to the data bus, the computer program code used for determining vertically and horizontally aligned cells in a structure data and comprising instructions executable by the processor and configured for: creating a two dimensional (2D) table from the structure data that includes orthogonal rows and columns of cells with values or object references; determining spanning rows and columns in the 2D table; and copying the values or object references of adjacent cells in the spanning rows and columns to create an expanded table with spanning rows and columns.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein: the structure data is an HTML document that represents a table.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein: the copying begins with spanning rows before spanning columns.
10. The system of claim 7, wherein: the copying begins with spanning columns before spanning rows.
11. The system of claim 7, further comprising: deduplicating the expanded table with spanning rows and columns, based on row features, to create a deduplicated table for header cell detection.
12. The system of claim 7, further comprising: deduplicating the expanded table with spanning rows and columns, based on column features, to create a deduplicated table for header cell detection.
13. A non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium embodying computer program code, the computer program code comprising computer executable instructions configured for: creating a two dimensional (2D) array from the structure data that includes orthogonal rows and columns of cells with object references; determining spanning rows and columns in the 2D array; and copying the object references of adjacent cells in the spanning rows and columns to create an expanded table with spanning rows and columns.
14. The non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein: the structure data is an HTML file representing a table.
15. The non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein: the object references defines vertical and horizontal alignment in the structure data.
16. The non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein: the copying begins with spanning rows before spanning columns.
17. The non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, further comprising: deduplicating the expanded table with spanning rows and columns, based on row features, to create a deduplicated table for header cell detection.
18. The non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, further comprising: deduplicating the expanded table with spanning rows and columns, based on column features, to create a deduplicated table for header cell detection.
19. The non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein the computer executable instructions are deployable to a client system from a server system at a remote location.
20. The non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein the computer executable instructions are provided by a service provider to a user on an on-demand basis.
