Current-mode analog multipliers using substrate bipolar transistors in CMOS for artificial intelligence
</title>

<abstract>
Analog multipliers can perform signal processing with approximate precision asynchronously (clock free) and with low power consumptions, which can be advantageous including in emerging mobile and portable artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications near or at the edge and or near sensors. Based on low cost, mainstream, and purely digital Complementary-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing process, the present invention discloses embodiments of current-mode analog multipliers that can be utilized in multiply-accumulate (MAC) signal processing in end-application that require low cost, low power consumption, (clock free) and asynchronous operations.
