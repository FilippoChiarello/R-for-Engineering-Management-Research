DEEP LEARNING BASED IMAGE COMPARISON DEVICE, METHOD AND COMPUTER PROGRAM STORED IN COMPUTER READABLE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
According to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, an image comparing method is disclosed. The image comparing method includes: receiving, by a pre-learned network function, first image data and second image data having correlation; determining anomaly related information of the second image data based on the received first image data and second image data; and outputting the anomaly related information determined by the network function.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of comparing an image, the method comprising: calculating, by one or more processors, a first image data which is a master image including only normal state image data without anomaly data using a first subnetwork included in a network function; calculating, by the one or more processors, a second image data which is a slave image corresponding to a determination of an anomaly using a second subnetwork included in the network function; determining, by the one or more processors, anomaly related information of the second image data based on a calculation result of the first image data and the second image data of the network function; and outputting, by the one or more processors, the anomaly related information determined by the network function.
2. (canceled)
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the network function further includes a comparison module, which is connected with at least one of the first subnetwork and the second subnetwork in series.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein at least one of the first subnetwork, the second subnetwork, and the comparison module has a deep neural network (DNN) structure.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein at least one of the first subnetwork and the second subnetwork has a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure among the DNN structures.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein the comparison module has a deconvolutional neural network (DCNN) structure among the DNN structures.
7. The method of claim 3, wherein the comparison module forms at least a part of a U network (U-net) structure with at least one of the first subnetwork and the second subnetwork.
8. The method of claim 3, wherein the first subnetwork and the second subnetwork share one or more links having a same weight.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the first subnetwork and the second subnetwork form at least a part of a Siamese network.
10. The method of claim 3, wherein the determining of the anomaly related information includes: generating, by the one or more processors, at least one layer comparison information based on at least one layer of the first subnetwork and at least one layer of the second subnetwork; and calculating, by the one or more processors, the anomaly related information based on the generated layer comparison information.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the calculating of the anomaly related information includes providing, by the one or more processors, a corresponding layer of the comparison module with the generated layer comparison information.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the corresponding layer is determined based on a location of the layer of the first subnetwork or the layer of the second subnetwork, which is the basis for generating the layer comparison information.
13. (canceled)
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the anomaly related information includes data related to location information about a pixel, at which the anomaly exists, in the second image data.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein the first image data and the second image data have a same size.
16. A computing device, comprising: one or more processors; and a memory to store instructions executable by the one or more processors; wherein the one or more processors are configured to: calculate a first image data which is a master image including only normal state image data without anomaly data using a first subnetwork included in a network function; calculate a second image data which is a slave image corresponding to a determination of an anomaly using a second subnetwork included in the network function; determine anomaly related information of the second image data based on a calculation result of the first image data and the second image data of the network function; and output the anomaly related information determined by the network function.
17. A computer program stored in a computer-readable storage medium including encoded instructions, the computer program being executable by one or more processors of a computing device to cause the one or more processors to perform operations for image comparison, the operations comprising: calculating, by the one or more processors, a first image data which is a master image including only normal state image data without anomaly data using a first subnetwork included in a network function; calculating, by the one or more processors, a second image data which is a slave image corresponding to a determination of an anomaly using a second subnetwork included in the network function; determining, by the one or more processors, anomaly related information of the second image data based on a calculation result of the first image data and the second image data of the network function; and outputting, by one or more processors, the anomaly related information determined by the network function.
