SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR GENERATING AN ARCHITECTURE FOR PRODUCTION OF GOODS AND SERVICES
</title>

<abstract>
A system including components for extensive and specialized processes to improve efficiency, increase productivity and optimize global resource and personnel distribution across all levels from creation to implementation from professional to prosumer and consumer, particularly in a shared economy is disclosed. A shared economy may provide a way of designing, creating, distributing and purchasing goods and services that differs from a traditional business model. A specially configured, networked system with an architecture for end user architects in a sharing economy-based industry to efficiently utilize resources including personnel, design, manufacturing and production resources as well as communications resources is disclosed.

<claims>
1. A system for a customized production of goods and services, comprising: a computing device adapted to receive input from and output information to an end user; a network in communication with a plurality of resource providers, each of the plurality of resource providers offering a required resource for production of a good or service; an architect engine connecting the computing device and the network, the architect engine adapted to: receive, from the computing device, a request for one or more required resources; determine a plurality of available resources from the plurality of resource providers; and receive, from the computing device, a selection of required resources.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the request for one or more required resources further comprises a plurality of categories of resources and the architect engine is further adapted to categorize the plurality of available resources into the plurality of categories.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the categories of resources further comprises a plurality of sublevels of the categories of resources and the architect engine is further adapted to categorize the plurality of available resources into the plurality of sublevels in each of the plurality of categories.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the selection of required resources includes a selection of one sublevel from each of the categories of the resources.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the architect engine is further adapted to calculate a cost of selected required resources based on the selection of sublevels from each of the categories of the resources.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the architect engine is further adapted to adjust the cost of selected required resources based on a change in the selection of sublevels from each of the categories of the resources.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the request for one or more required resources further comprises a request location, a request date, and a request time and the architect engine is further adapted to reserve the one or more required resources at the request location on the request date at the request time.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the architect engine is further adapted to establish a control connection between the computing device and the selected required resources at the request location on the request date at the request time, the control connection established using remote device control technology.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the architect engine is further adapted to end the control connection once the end user completes use of the one or more required resources.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the architect engine is further adapted to request and receive input about user resources available through the system.
11. A method for a providing an exchange for production of a good or service implemented, the method comprising: receiving, from a computing device, a request for one or more required resources from an end user; determining a plurality of available resources from a network in communication with a plurality of resource providers; generating an exchange platform offering the one or more required resources from the plurality of available resources; presenting the exchange platform on the computing device; and receiving, from the computing device, a selection of one or more required resources.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising categorizing the plurality of available resources into a plurality of categories of resources, wherein the request for one or more required resources further comprises the plurality of categories of the resources.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising categorizing the plurality of available resources into a plurality of sublevels in each of the plurality of categories, wherein the categories of resources further comprises the plurality of sublevels of the categories of resources.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the selection of one or more required resources includes a selection of one sublevel from each of the categories of the resources.
15. The method of claim 14, further comprising calculating a cost of the selected one or more required resources based on the selection of sublevels from each of the categories of the resources.
16. The method of claim 15, further comprising adjusting the cost of selected one or more required resources based on a change in the selection of sublevels from each of the categories of the resources.
17. The method of claim 11, further comprising reserving the selected one or more required resources at a request location on a request date at a request time, wherein the request for one or more required resources further comprises the request location, the request date, and the request time.
18. The method of claim 17, further comprising establishing a control connection between the computing device and the one or more required resources at the request location on the request date at the request time, the control connection established using remote device control technology.
19. The method of claim 18, further comprising ending the control connection once the end user completes use of the selected one or more required resources.
20. The method of claim 11, further comprising requesting and receiving input, from the computing device, about user production resources available.
