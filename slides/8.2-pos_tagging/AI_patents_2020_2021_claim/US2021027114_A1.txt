PACKER CLASSIFICATION APPARATUS AND METHOD USING PE SECTION INFORMATION
</title>

<abstract>
A packer classification apparatus extracts features based on a section that holds packer information from files and classifies packers using a Deep Neural Network(DNN) for detection of new/variant packers. A packer classification apparatus according to an embodiment uses PE section information. packer classification apparatus includes a collection classification module collecting a data set and classifying data by packer type to prepare for a model learning, a token hash module tokenizing a character string obtained after extracting labels and section names of each data and combining the section names, and obtaining a certain standard output value using Feature Hashing, and a type classification module generating a learning model after learning the data set with a Deep Neural Network(DNN) algorithm using extracted features, and classifying files for each packer type using the learning model after extracting features for the files to be classified.
