ADAPTIVE AND FIXED MAPPING FOR COMPRESSION OF AUDIO DATA
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods, and software are disclosed herein for compressing audio data. In an implementation, sampled values of an audio signal have a dynamic range. A division of the dynamic range, into at least a lower range and an upper range, is identified based on a fixed mapping of a lower portion of the sampled values to a subset of quanta in a set of quanta having a depth less than a depth of the sampled values. Then an adaptive mapping of an upper portion of the sampled values to a remaining subset of quanta in the set of quanta is also identified, based at least on a dimension of the upper range. The fixed mapping is used to encode the lower portion of the sampled values based, while the adaptive mapping is used to encode the upper portion of the sampled values based on the adaptive mapping.

<claims>
1. A method for compressing sampled values of audio data having a dynamic range, the method comprising:
identifying a fixed mapping of a lower range of the sampled values of the audio data to a subset of quanta in a set of quanta having a depth less than a depth of the sampled values;
identifying an upper range of the sampled values of the audio data remaining after the fixed mapping of the lower range of the sampled values;
identifying an adaptive mapping of the upper range of the sampled values to a remaining subset of quanta in the set of quanta; and
encoding the lower range of the sampled values based on the fixed mapping; and encoding the upper range of the sampled values based on the adaptive mapping.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein identifying the upper range of the sampled values remaining after the fixed mapping comprises:
identifying a maximum value of the lower range of the sampled values that map to the subset of quanta; and dividing the dynamic range at the identified maximum value into the lower range and the upper range.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein the dimension of the upper range comprises a size of the upper range determined based on a maximum value of the sampled values less the maximum value of the lower range of the sampled values.
4. The method of claim 3 wherein the subset of quanta comprises a fixed number of quanta and wherein the fixed mapping comprises a one-to-one mapping of the fixed number of quanta to a same number of the sampled values.
5. The method of claim 4 wherein the remaining subset of quanta comprises a remaining number of quanta and wherein the adaptive mapping comprises a many-to-one mapping of a remainder of the sampled values to the remaining number of quanta.
6. The method of claim 5 wherein encoding the lower range based on the fixed mapping comprises, for each value of the lower range of the sampled values, converting the value to a corresponding one, of the subset of quanta, and writing the corresponding one to a file.
7. The method of claim 6 wherein encoding the upper range based on the adaptive mapping comprises, for each value of the upper range of the sampled values, converting the value to a nearest one, of the subset of quanta, and writing the nearest one to the file.
8. The method of claim 7 wherein the file includes a key for mapping the set of quanta to a corresponding set of decoded values having a depth greater than the depth of the set of quanta.
9. The method of claim 8 wherein the depth of the set of quanta comprises 8 bits, the depth of the corresponding set of decoded values comprises 16 bits, and the depth of the sampled values comprises 16 bits.
10. A computing apparatus comprising:
one or more computer readable storage media;
one or more processors operatively coupled with the one or more computer readable storage media; and
program instructions stored on the one or more computer readable storage media that, when executed by the one or more processors, direct the computing apparatus to at least:
identify a dynamic range from sampled values of an audio signal; identify a division of the dynamic range into at least a lower range and an upper range based at least on a fixed mapping of a lower portion of the sampled values to a subset of quanta in a set of quanta having a depth less than a depth of the sampled values;
identify, based at least on a dimension of the upper range, an adaptive mapping of an upper portion of the sampled values to a remaining subset of quanta in the set of quanta;
encode the lower portion of the sampled values based on the fixed mapping; and
encode the upper portion of the sampled values based on the adaptive mapping.
11. The computing apparatus of claim 10 wherein, to identify the division of the dynamic range into the lower range and the upper range based on the fixed mapping of the lower portion of the sampled values to the subset of quanta, the program instructions direct the computing apparatus to at least:
identify a maximum value of the lower portion of the sampled values that map to the subset of quanta; and
divide the dynamic range at the identified maximum value into the lower range and the upper range.
12. The computing apparatus of claim 11 wherein the dimension of the upper range comprises a size of the upper range determined based on a maximum value of the sampled values less the maximum value of the lower portion of the sampled values.
13. The computing apparatus of claim 12 wherein the subset of quanta comprises a fixed number of quanta and wherein the fixed mapping comprises a one-to-one mapping of the fixed number of quanta to a same number of the sampled values.
14. The computing apparatus of claim 13 wherein the remaining subset of quanta comprises a remaining number of quanta and wherein the adaptive mapping comprises a many-to-one mapping of a remainder of the sampled values to the remaining number of quanta.
15. The computing apparatus of claim 14 wherein, to encode the lower range based on the fixed mapping, the program instructions direct the computing apparatus to, for each value of the lower portion of the sampled values, convert the value to a corresponding one, of the subset of quanta, and write the corresponding one to a file.
