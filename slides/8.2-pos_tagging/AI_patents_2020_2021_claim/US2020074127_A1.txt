SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR UNIQUE IDENTIFIER DETECTION BASED ON INVISIBLE LIGHT
</title>

<abstract>
An invisible light sensing device senses invisible light from a plurality of invisible light emitting or reflecting objects in which each of the invisible light emitting or reflecting objects emits or reflects invisible light in an identification pattern that is distinct from other identification patterns. An identification pattern is based on a sequenced pulsing pattern of invisible light that is emitted by an invisible light emitting object to form the identification pattern. An identification pattern is also based on an invisible light reflective coating that is applied to an invisible light reflecting object.
