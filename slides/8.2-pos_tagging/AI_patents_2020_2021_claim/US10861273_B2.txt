<title>
Employing pressure signatures for personal identification
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for a biometric authentication system. In one aspect, a method includes capturing pressure measurement data as a sequence of pressure maps as the user applies pressure to the pressure sensing device; determining a dynamic pressure signature for the user based on the pressure measurement data, the dynamic pressure signature including a temporal sequence of the pressure maps; and authenticating the user based on a comparison of the dynamic pressure signature to an initial dynamic pressure signature.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for authenticating a user based on pressure measurement data, the method being executed by one or more processors and comprising: capturing, by a pressure sensing device, pressure measurement data of a user as a plurality of pressure maps; determining a dynamic pressure signature for the user based on the pressure measurement data, the dynamic pressure signature including a temporal sequence of the pressure maps; generating a similarity score based on a comparison of the dynamic pressure signature to a template; and authenticating the user based on the similarity score.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the similarity score is based on Euclidean distance of the dynamic pressure signature and the template.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the similarity score in included in multimodal-biometric score; and wherein the user is authenticated based on the multimodal-biometric score.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the pressure maps includes a collection of time signals derived from each pressure pixel observed by the pressure sensing device as the user applies pressure.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, wherein the dynamic pressure signature includes at least one of: which of the user's feet predominantly touches the ground as the user walks, a first point of impact on each of the user's feet as the user walks, a progression of pressure points as the user walks, and gait patterns for the user.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the captured pressure measurement data includes the user's foot/show contour, an angle between the user's feet, curvature of the user's feet, gait, balance, sway, posture, weight distribution, the user's dominant foot, or ballistocardiograms.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the template is captured at an entry-point of a pre-defined area.
8. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the template is captured during an enrollment process.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 8, comprising: capturing, with a camera, an image of the user, wherein a distance of the user from the camera is determined based on a position of the pressure sensing device.
10. The computer-implemented method of claim 9, wherein authenticating the user is further based on a comparison of the image of the user to an initial image of the user captured during the enrollment process.
11. The computer-implemented method of claim 9, comprising: determining a static pressure signature for the user based on the pressure measurement data; wherein authenticating the user is further based on a comparison of the static pressure signature for the user to an initial static pressure signature captured during the enrollment process.
12. The computer-implemented method of claim 11, wherein the static pressure signature includes an approximate size and shape of the user's foot or shoes.
13. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the user applies pressure to the pressure sensing device by standing on the pressure sensing device or by walking across the pressure sensing device.
