METHOD AND DEVICE FOR PROCESSING VIDEO SIGNAL ON BASIS OF INTER PREDICTION
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosure discloses a method for processing a video signal and an apparatus therefor. Specifically, the method of processing a video signal based on an inter prediction, comprising: configuring a merge list based on a neighboring block of a current block; adding a history based merge candidate included in a history based merge candidate list to the merge list when a number of a merge candidate included in the merge list is smaller than a first predetermined number; obtaining a merge index indicating a merge candidate used for an inter prediction of the current block within the merge list; and generating a prediction block of the current block based on motion information of a merge candidate indicated by the merge index, wherein a step of adding the history based merge candidate to the merge list comprises checking whether a second predetermined number of the history based merge candidate within the history based merge candidate list has the same motion information as the merge candidate included in the merge list.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for processing a video signal based on an inter prediction, comprising: configuring a merge list based on a neighboring block of a current block; adding a history based merge candidate included in a history based merge candidate list to the merge list based on that a number of a merge candidate included in the merge list is smaller than a first number; obtaining a merge index indicating a merge candidate used for an inter prediction of the current block within the merge list; and generating a prediction block of the current block based on motion information of the merge candidate indicated by the merge index, wherein a step of adding the history based merge candidate to the merge list comprises checking whether a second number of the history based merge candidate within the history based merge candidate list has the same motion information as the merge candidate included in the merge list.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the second number of the history based merge candidate is added to the merge list based on that it has motion information different with a predefined merge candidate of merge candidates included in the merge list.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the second number of the history based merge candidate is added to the merge list based on that it has motion information different with a third number of predefined merge candidates of merge candidates included in the merge list.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the second number of the history based merge candidate is added to the merge list based on that it has motion information different with a predefined spatial merge candidate included in the merge list.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the first number is defined as a value being 1 subtracted from a maximum number of merge candidates.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of adding a history based merge candidate comprises: checking whether two history based merge candidates have the same motion information as merge candidates included in the merge list based on that there are three current merge candidates included in the merge list.
7. An apparatus of processing a video signal based on an inter prediction, comprising: a memory configured to store the video signal; and a processor combined to the memory, wherein the processor is configured to: configure a merge list based on a neighboring block of a current block; add a history based merge candidate included in a history based merge candidate list to the merge list based on that a number of a merge candidate included in the merge list is smaller than a first number; obtain a merge index indicating a merge candidate used for an inter prediction of the current block within the merge list; and generate a prediction block of the current block based on motion information of the merge candidate indicated by the merge index, wherein the processor is further configured to check whether a second number of the history based merge candidate within the history based merge candidate list has the same motion information as the merge candidate included in the merge list.
8. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein the second number of the history based merge candidate is added to the merge list based on that it has motion information different with a predefined merge candidate of merge candidates included in the merge list.
9. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the second number of the history based merge candidate is added to the merge list based on that it has motion information different with a third number of predefined merge candidates of merge candidates included in the merge list.
10. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the second number of the history based merge candidate is added to the merge list based on that it has motion information different with a predefined spatial merge candidate included in the merge list.
11. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the first number is defined as a value being 1 subtracted from a maximum number of merge candidates.
12. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to: check whether two history based merge candidates have the same motion information as merge candidates included in the merge list based on that there are three current merge candidates included in the merge list.
