METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING CONVERSATION SERVICE BY USING AUTONOMOUS BEHAVIOR ROBOT, AND NON-TRANSITORY COMPUTER-READABLE RECORDING MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
According to one aspect of the present invention, provided is a method for providing a conversation service by using an autonomous behavior robot, comprising the steps of: recognizing a user corresponding to acquired face information; determining conversation content to be provided to the user on the basis of a personal attribute related to the recognized user and/or the reliability of the personal attribute; and updating the personal attribute and/or the reliability of the personal attribute on the basis of the user's feedback for the conversation content.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of providing a conversation service using an autonomous behavior robot, the method comprising: recognizing a user corresponding to acquired face information; determining a conversation content to be provided to the user based on at least one of a personal attribute related to the recognized user and a reliability of the personal attribute; and updating at least one of the personal attribute and the reliability of the personal attribute based on feedback of the user for the conversation content.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the determining further comprises determining whether the recognized user corresponds to an interest person, and wherein the interest person includes a user whose interest energy, which is determined by referring to at least one of a frequency, a number, and a period of time for acquiring face information, is maintained for a predetermined period of time or more.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the determining further includes: determining a conversation type to be provided to the user based on the personal attribute and the reliability of the personal attribute; and determining a conversation content associated with the conversation type by referring to a conversation template grouped according to the personal attribute.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the updating includes updating the reliability of the personal attribute of the user associated with the feedback by referring to a type of the feedback.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the updating includes changing the personal attribute when the reliability of the updated personal attribute has a predetermined level or less.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising resetting the updated reliability of the personal attribute when the personal attribute is changed.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein initial information of the personal attribute is estimated from face information of the user or acquired from the feedback of the user.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein an initial value of the reliability of the personal attribute acquired from the feedback of the user is set higher than an initial value of the reliability of the personal attribute estimated from the face information of the user.
9. A non-transitory computer readable recording medium that stores a computer program for executing the method according to claim 1.
10. A system for providing a conversation service using an autonomous behavior robot, the system comprising: a face information management unit configured to recognize a user corresponding to acquired face information; a conversation management unit configured to determine a conversation content to be provided to the user based on at least one of a personal attribute related to the recognized user and a reliability of the personal attribute; and an update management unit configured to update at least one of the personal attribute and the reliability of the personal attribute based on feedback of the user for the conversation content.
