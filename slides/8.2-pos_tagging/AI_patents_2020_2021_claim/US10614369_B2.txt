Machine learning device and user identification device
</title>

<abstract>
A machine learning device capable of preventing spoofing of an operator to secure safety during an operation of a robot is provided. A machine learning device includes: an input data acquisition means that acquires, as input data, operation data including a measurement value related to a movement of at least a portion of a body of the operator and a shape of the body, detected when the operator is caused to perform a predetermined operation associated with a training operation panel of the robot controller; a label acquisition means that acquires identification information of the operator as a label; and a learning means that constructs a learning model that performs user identification for authenticating operators of the robot controller by performing supervised learning using a pair of the input data and the label as training data.

2. The machine learning device according to claim 1, wherein the training operation panel displays a guidance for the predetermined operation associated with the training operation panel of the robot controller on a display included in the training operation panel.
3. The machine learning device according to claim 1, wherein the predetermined operation associated with the training operation panel of the robot controller includes an operation that the operator actually performs when using the training operation panel during operation.
4. The machine learning device according to claim 1, wherein the operations further include acquiring the feature amount obtained from the measurement value as the operation data.
5. The machine learning device according to claim 4, wherein the feature amount is related to at least one of an operation order of the training operation panel detected by the training operation panel on the basis of the operation of the operator, a use frequency of each key switch included in the training operation panel, a use frequency of a deadman's switch included in the training operation panel, a vibration detected by the training operation panel, an acceleration detected by the training operation panel, a body inclination during operation of the training operation panel, and a writing pressure detected by a touch panel of the training operation panel.
6. A user identification device using the learning model constructed by the machine learning device according to claim 1, the user identification device comprising: a second memory; a second processor, wherein the second processor executes a program stored in the second memory to perform operations comprising: acquiring operation data including a measurement value related to a movement of at least a portion of a body of the operator and a shape of the body, detected by causing the operator to perform the predetermined operation associated with the training operation panel; and identifying the operator on the basis of the operation data and the learning model.
7. The user identification device according to claim 6, wherein the operations further include: acquiring operation data including a measurement value related to a movement of at least a portion of a body of the operator and a shape of the body when the operator is executing an actual operation associated with the training operation panel during actual operation, and determining whether identification information of the operator is correct or wrong on the basis of the operation data and the learning model.
8. The user identification device according to claim 6, wherein the user identification device is incorporated into the training operation panel and is integrated with the training operation panel.
9. A user identification device comprising: the machine learning device according to claim 1; a second memory; a second processor, wherein the second processor executes a program stored in the second memory to perform operations comprising: acquiring operation data including a measurement value related to a movement of at least a portion of a body of the operator and a shape of the body, detected by causing the operator to perform the predetermined operation associated with the training operation panel; and identifying the operator on the basis of the operation data and the learning model constructed by the machine learning device.
