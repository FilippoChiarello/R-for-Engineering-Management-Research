<title>
OPTIMIZING DELAY-SENSITIVE NETWORK-BASED COMMUNICATIONS WITH LATENCY GUIDANCE
</title>

<abstract>
Devices, computer-readable media, and methods for selecting a type of packet loss protection for a network-based communication based upon a latency estimate are disclosed. For example, a processing system including at least one processor may obtain a latency estimate for a network-based communication, determine whether the latency estimate exceeds a latency threshold for selecting a type of packet loss protection, and select, the type of packet loss protection for the network-based communication from among a first type of packet loss protection and a second type of packet loss protection based upon the determining. When the latency estimate is determined to not exceed the latency threshold, the first type of packet loss protection is selected. When the latency estimate is determined to exceed the latency threshold, the second type of packet loss protection is selected.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: obtaining, by a processing system including at least one processor, a latency estimate for a network-based communication; determining, by the processing system, whether the latency estimate exceeds a latency threshold for selecting a type of packet loss protection; and selecting, by the processing system, the type of packet loss protection for the network-based communication from among a first type of packet loss protection and a second type of packet loss protection based upon the determining, wherein when the latency estimate is determined to not exceed the latency threshold, the first type of packet loss protection is selected, and wherein when the latency estimate is determined to exceed the latency threshold, the second type of packet loss protection is selected.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first type of pack loss protection comprises a packet retransmission scheme.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the second type of packet loss protection comprises a forward error correction scheme.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the second type of packet loss protection comprises a redundant stream scheme.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: sending an instruction to apply to the network-based communication the type of packet loss protection that is selected.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: applying, to the network-based communication, the type of packet loss protection that is selected.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the network-based communication comprises a stream of at least one of: visual data; or audio data.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the processing system comprises a network-based processing system.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the processing system comprises at least one device that is a participant of the network-based communication.
10. A device comprising: a processor; and a computer-readable medium storing instructions which, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform operations, the operations comprising: obtaining a latency estimate for a network-based communication; determining whether the latency estimate exceeds a latency threshold for selecting a type of packet loss protection; and selecting the type of packet loss protection for the network-based communication from among a first type of packet loss protection and a second type of packet loss protection based upon the determining, wherein when the latency estimate is determined to not exceed the latency threshold, the first type of packet loss protection is selected, and wherein when the latency estimate is determined to exceed the latency threshold, the second type of packet loss protection is selected.
11. The device of claim 10, wherein the first type of pack loss protection comprises a packet retransmission scheme.
12. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions which, when executed by a processing system including at least one processor, cause the processing system to perform operations, the operations comprising: obtaining a latency estimate for a network-based communication; determining whether the latency estimate exceeds a latency threshold for selecting a type of packet loss protection; and selecting the type of packet loss protection for the network-based communication from among a first type of packet loss protection and a second type of packet loss protection based upon the determining, wherein when the latency estimate is determined to not exceed the latency threshold, the first type of packet loss protection is selected, and wherein when the latency estimate is determined to exceed the latency threshold, the second type of packet loss protection is selected.
13. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 12, wherein the first type of pack loss protection comprises a packet retransmission scheme.
14. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 13, wherein the second type of packet loss protection comprises a forward error correction scheme.
15. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 13, wherein the second type of packet loss protection comprises a redundant stream scheme.
16. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 12, wherein the operations further comprise: sending an instruction to apply to the network-based communication the type of packet loss protection that is selected.
17. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 12, wherein the operations further comprise: applying, to the network-based communication, the type of packet loss protection that is selected.
18. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 12, wherein the network-based communication comprises a stream of at least one of: visual data; or audio data.
19. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 12, wherein the processing system comprises a network-based processing system.
20. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 12, wherein the processing system comprises at least one device that is a participant of the network-based communication.
