<title>
COGNITIVE EVALUATION DETERMINED FROM SOCIAL INTERACTIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method, system, and computer program product are provided for determining cognitive issues. The method includes building, by a processor device with social network data, a patient model for social interactions between a patient and other people. The method also includes computing, by the processor device, changes between the patient model and new social network data. The method additionally includes evaluating, by the processor device, the changes between the patient model and new social network data to generate evaluated changes. The method further includes determining, by the processor device, a patient metric score responsive the evaluated changes. The method also includes controlling an operation of a processor-controlled device responsive to the patient metric score.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for determining cognitive issues, comprising: building, by a processor device with social network data, a patient model for social interactions between a patient and other people; computing, by the processor device, changes between the patient model and new social network data; evaluating, by the processor device, the changes between the patient model and new social network data to generate evaluated changes; determining, by the processor device, a patient metric score responsive the evaluated changes; and controlling an operation of a processor-controlled device responsive to the patient metric score.
2. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 1, wherein receiving includes receiving social media feeds for the patient.
3. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 1, wherein building includes receiving audio data and video data from the area around the patient.
4. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 1, wherein building includes generating a thumbprint for the patient and people known to the patient.
5. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 4, wherein generating the thumbprint includes utilizing the physical characteristics of the patient for identifying the patient in the new social network data.
6. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 1, wherein evaluating includes cataloging and classifying emotions of the patient in the new social network data when interacting with both known people and unknown people.
7. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 1, wherein controlling includes sounding an alarm for a caregiver to intervene when the patient is interacting abnormally.
8. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 1, wherein evaluating includes developing patterns over time of interactions the patient has with known people.
9. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 8, wherein the patterns are selected from the group consisting of frequency of interaction, duration of interaction, time of day of interaction, and day of week of interaction.
10. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 1, wherein evaluating includes analyzing a sweat output of the patient to detect the patient's mood.
11. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 1, wherein the new social network data is gathered from internet of thing devices.
12. A computer program product for determining cognitive impairment, the computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by a computer to cause the computer to perform a method comprising: building, by a processor device with social network data, a patient model for social interactions between a patient and other people; computing, by the processor device, changes between the patient model and new social network data; evaluating, by the processor device, the changes between the patient model and new social network data to generate evaluated changes; determining, by the processor device, a patient metric score responsive the evaluated changes; and controlling an operation of a processor-controlled device responsive to the patient metric score.
13. A cognitive detection system for determining cognitive impairment, comprising: a communication system connected to a communication network; a processing system including a processor device and memory receiving social network data, the processing system programmed to: build, with the social network data, a patient model for social interactions between a patient and other people; compute changes between the patient model and new social network data; evaluate the changes between the patient model and new social network data to generate evaluated changes; determine a patient metric score responsive the evaluated changes; and control an operation of a processor-controlled device responsive to the patient metric score.
14. The system as recited in claim 13, further comprising a camera connected to the communication network.
15. The system as recited in claim 13, further comprising a wearable device that can analyze the sweat of the wear to determine mood.
16. The system as recited in claim 13, further programmed to develop patterns over time of interactions the patient has with known people.
17. The system as recited in claim 16, wherein the patterns are selected from the group consisting of frequency of interaction, duration of interaction, time of day of interaction, and day of week of interaction.
18. The system as recited in claim 13, further programmed to generate a thumbprint for the patient utilizing the physical characteristics of the patient for identifying the patient in the new social network data.
19. The system as recited in claim 13, wherein the social network data include social media feeds for the patient.
20. The system as recited in claim 13, further programmed to gather the new social network data from internet of things devices.
