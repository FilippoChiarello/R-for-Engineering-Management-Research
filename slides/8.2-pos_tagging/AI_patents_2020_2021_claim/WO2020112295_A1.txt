<title>
SYSTEM MODEL AND ARCHITECTURE FOR MOBILE INTEGRATED ACCESS AND BACKHAUL IN ADVANCED NETWORKS
</title>

<abstract>
Facilitating operation and support of mobile relays based on an integrated access and backhaul concept for advanced networks (e.g., 4G, 5G, 6G, and beyond) is provided. An embodiment relates to a communication network architecture that can comprise a control plane architecture of a relay node device. The control plane architecture can comprise a star-type architecture. Further, the communication network architecture can comprise a user plane architecture of the relay node device. The user plane architecture can be separated from (or independent of) the control plane architecture. Further, the user plane architecture can comprise a multi-hop architecture. The relay node device can be configured to operate according to a fifth generation wireless network communication protocol, or other advanced communication protocols.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method, comprising:
facilitating, by a first relay node device comprising a processor, a first connection to a donor node device, wherein the first connection is configured for a master cell group; and facilitating, by the first relay node device, a second connection to a second relay node device, wherein the second connection is configured for a secondary cell group, and wherein the first connection and the second connection are separate connections.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the facilitating the first connection comprises facilitating the first connection via a control plane architecture of the first relay node device, and wherein the control plane architecture comprises a star-type architecture.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the facilitating the second connection comprises facilitating the second connection via a user plane architecture of the second relay node device, and wherein the user plane architecture comprises a multi-hop architecture and is separated from the control plane architecture.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
implementing, by the first relay node device, a control plane procedure based on using the first connection for a master cell group bearer of the first relay node device.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
carrying, by the first relay node device, backhaul traffic over the second connection, wherein the backhaul traffic is carried on a secondary cell group bearer for the first relay node device and the second relay node device.
6. A communication network architecture, comprising:
a control plane architecture of a relay node device, wherein the control plane architecture comprises a star-type architecture; and
a user plane architecture of the relay node device, wherein the user plane architecture is separated from the control plane architecture, and wherein the user plane architecture comprises a multi-hop architecture.
7. The communication network architecture of claim 6, wherein the star-type architecture comprises an architecture in which respective relay devices of a group of relay devices are directly connected to a donor node device.
8. The communication network architecture of claim 7, wherein the control plane architecture comprises respective integrated access and backhaul node devices of a group of integrated access and backhaul node devices being a single hop away from the donor node device.
9. The communication network architecture of claim 6, wherein the control plane architecture comprises communications interface messages sent to an access donor node device at the relay node device.
10. The communication network architecture of claim 9, wherein the communications interface messages comprise FI application protocol messages.
11. The communication network architecture of claim 6, wherein the control plane architecture comprises radio resource control messages sent to a device at the relay node device.
12. The communication network architecture of claim 6, wherein the control plane architecture comprises radio resource control messages sent to a user equipment device being served by an access donor node device.
13. The communication network architecture of claim 6, wherein the control plane architecture comprises radio resource control messages carried inside FI application protocol messages.
14. The communication network architecture of claim 6, wherein the relay node device is configured to operate according to a fifth generation wireless network communication protocol.
15. A relay node device, comprising:
a control plane comprising a star-type architecture; and
a user plane, comprising a multi-hop architecture, wherein the user plane is separated from the control plane for mobility and handover purposes.
16. The relay node device of claim 15, wherein the control plane comprises radio resource control messages sent to a user equipment device being served by an access donor node device.
17. The relay node device of claim 16, wherein the radio resource control messages are sent to a node of the relay node device.
18. The relay node device of claim 15, wherein the control plane comprises
communications interface messages sent to an access donor node of the relay node device.
19. The relay node device of claim 15, wherein the star-type architecture comprises an architecture in which respective relay devices of a group of relay devices are directly connected to a donor node device.
20. The relay node device of claim 19, wherein the control plane comprises respective integrated access and backhaul nodes of a group of integrated access and backhaul nodes being a single hop away from the donor node device.
