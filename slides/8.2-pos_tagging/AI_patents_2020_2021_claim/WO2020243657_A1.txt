REPRODUCIBLE BRAIN ORGANOIDS AND METHODS OF MAKING
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure is directed to methods of producing dorsal forebrain organoids having cores with a very low incident of apoptotic and hypoxic cells and having highly similar cell types and cell type prevalence. The present disclosure is also directed to compositions comprising such organoids and the use of such organoids for the screening of agents.
