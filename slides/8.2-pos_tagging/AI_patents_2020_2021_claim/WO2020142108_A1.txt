USING BAYESIAN INFERENCE TO PREDICT REVIEW DECISIONS IN A MATCH GRAPH
</title>

<abstract>
Implementations disclose methods and systems for using Bayesian inference to predict review decisions in a match graph. A method includes identifying a current media item to be processed; processing labeled media items to identify labeled media items that include at least one respective segment that is similar to one of segments of the current media item; for each of the segments of the current media item, generating a segment prediction value indicating a particular property associated with a corresponding segment of the current media item based on properties associated with respective labeled media items that each include a respective segment similar to the corresponding segment; calculating a media item prediction value for the current media item based on a generated segment prediction value of each of the segments of the current media item; and causing the current media item to be processed based on the calculated media item prediction value.
