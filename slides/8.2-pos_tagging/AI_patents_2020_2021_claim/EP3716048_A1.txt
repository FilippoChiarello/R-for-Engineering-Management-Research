APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DOWN-CONVERTING AND INTERLEAVING MULTIPLE FLOATING POINT VALUES
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus and method down-converting and interleaving data elements. For example, one embodiment of a processor comprises: a decoder to decode a first instruction to generate a decoded instruction; a first source register to store a first plurality of packed data elements; a second source register to store a second plurality of packed data elements; a destination register to store a third plurality and a fourth plurality of packed data elements, each of the third and fourth plurality of packed data elements to be encoded with fewer bits than each of the first and second plurality of packed data elements; execution circuitry to execute the decoded instruction, the execution circuitry comprising: down-conversion circuitry to down-convert each of the first plurality of packed data elements to generate one of the third plurality of packed data elements and to down-convert each of the second plurality of packed data elements to generate one of the fourth plurality of packed data elements; interleave circuitry to interleave the third plurality of packed data elements with the fourth plurality of packed data elements within the destination register.

<claims>
1. A processor comprising: a decoder to decode a first instruction to generate a decoded instruction; a first source register to store a first plurality of packed data elements; a second source register to store a second plurality of packed data elements; a destination register to store a third plurality and a fourth plurality of packed data elements, each of the third and fourth plurality of packed data elements to be encoded with fewer bits than each of the first and second plurality of packed data elements; execution circuitry to execute the decoded instruction, the execution circuitry comprising: down-conversion circuitry to down-convert each of the first plurality of packed data elements to generate one of the third plurality of packed data elements and to down-convert each of the second plurality of packed data elements to generate one of the fourth plurality of packed data elements; interleave circuitry to interleave the third plurality of packed data elements with the fourth plurality of packed data elements within the destination register.
2. The processor of claim 1 wherein each data element in the first and second plurality of packed data elements comprises N bits and wherein each data element in the third and fourth plurality of packed data elements comprises N/2 bits.
3. The processor of claim 2 wherein each data element in the first and second plurality of packed data elements comprises a 32-bit floating point value and wherein each data element in the third and fourth plurality of packed data elements comprises a 16-bit value.
4. The processor of claim 3 wherein the 16-bit value comprises a bfloat 16 value.
5. The processor of claim 4 wherein the bfloat 16 value comprises a 7-bit mantissa value, an 8-bit exponent value, and a 1-bit sign value.
6. The processor of claim 1 or 5 wherein the execution circuitry comprises:
de-interleave and up-conversion circuitry to de-interleave and up-convert the third and fourth plurality of data elements to reproduce the first plurality of packed data elements in the first source register and reproduce the second plurality of packed data elements in the second source register.
7. The processor of claim 5 wherein the first and second source registers and the destination register comprise 128-bit registers, 256-bit registers, or 512-bit registers.
8. The processor of claim 5 wherein the execution circuitry is to execute a sequence of instructions to perform a machine learning operation using the third and fourth plurality of data elements.
9. A method comprising: decoding a first instruction to generate a decoded instruction; storing a first plurality of packed data elements in a first source register; storing a second plurality of packed data elements in a second source register; executing the decoded instruction and responsively: down-converting each of the first plurality of packed data elements to generate one of the third plurality of packed data elements down-converting each of the second plurality of packed data elements to generate one of the fourth plurality of packed data elements; interleaving the third plurality of packed data elements with the fourth plurality of packed data elements within a destination register.
10. The method of claim 9 wherein each data element in the first and second plurality of packed data elements comprises N bits and wherein each data element in the third and fourth plurality of packed data elements comprises N/2 bits.
11. The method of claim 10 wherein each data element in the first and second plurality of packed data elements comprises a 32-bit floating point value and wherein each data element in the third and fourth plurality of packed data elements comprises a 16-bit value.
12. The method of claim 11 wherein the 16-bit value comprises a bfloat 16 value.
13. The method of claim 12 wherein the bfloat 16 value comprises a 7-bit mantissa value, an 8-bit exponent value, and a 1-bit sign value.
14. The method of claim 9 or 13 further comprising:
de-interleaving and up-converting the third and fourth plurality of data elements to reproduce the first plurality of packed data elements in the first source register and reproduce the second plurality of packed data elements in the second source register.
15. The method of claim 13 wherein the first and second source registers and the destination register comprise 128-bit registers, 256-bit registers, or 512-bit registers.
