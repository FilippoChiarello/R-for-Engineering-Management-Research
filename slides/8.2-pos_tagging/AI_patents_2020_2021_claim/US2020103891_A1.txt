METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR A DATA MARKETPLACE IN A CONVEYOR ENVIRONMENT
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems for a data marketplace in a conveyor environment includes a self-organizing data marketplace. The self-organizing data marketplace includes at least one data collector and at least one corresponding conveyor in an industrial environment, wherein the at least one data collector is structured to collect detection values from at least one sensor of a power roller of the at least one corresponding conveyor; a data storage structured to store a data pool comprising at least a portion of the detection values; a data marketplace structured to self-organize the data pool; and a transaction system structured to interpret a user data request, and to selectively provide a portion of the self-organized data pool to a user in response to the user data request.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A self-organizing data marketplace, comprising: at least one data collector and at least one corresponding conveyor in an industrial environment, wherein the at least one data collector is structured to collect detection values from at least one sensor of a power roller of the at least one corresponding conveyor; a data storage structured to store a data pool comprising at least a portion of the detection values; a data marketplace structured to self-organize the data pool; and a transaction system structured to interpret a user data request, and to selectively provide a portion of the self-organized data pool to a user in response to the user data request.
2. The self-organizing data marketplace of claim 1, wherein the data marketplace is structured to self-organize where the data pool is stored.
3. The self-organizing data marketplace of claim 1, wherein the data marketplace is structured to self-organize a duration of storage for collected detection values in the data pool.
4. The self-organizing data marketplace of claim 1, wherein the at least one sensor is structured to detect a condition of the power roller comprising at least one of: a rate of rotation of the power roller, a load being transported by the power roller, a power amount consumed by the power roller, or a rate of acceleration of the power roller.
5. The self-organizing data marketplace of claim 1, wherein the data marketplace is structured to self-organize in response to which collected detection values in the data pool receive user data requests.
6. The self-organizing data marketplace of claim 1, further comprising a cognitive data packaging system structured to use machine-based intelligence to package data by automatically configuring packages of the collected detection values in batches, streams, or pools.
7. The self-organizing data marketplace of claim 6, wherein the machine-based intelligence further utilizes one or more rules, models, or parameters to automatically configure the packages of the collected detection values.
8. The self-organizing data marketplace of claim 1, wherein self-organizing comprises organizing at least one of the collected detection values and the data pool based on a metric of success.
9. The self-organizing data marketplace of claim 8, wherein the metric of success comprises a profit measure comprising an income related to access to the data pool.
10. The self-organizing data marketplace of claim 8, wherein the metric of success comprises a yield measure.
11. The self-organizing data marketplace of claim 10, wherein the yield measure comprises at least one yield measure selected from: a percentage of user data requests that are met with data from the data pool; a percentage of requested data of user data requests that is met with data from the data pool; and a percentage of data in the data pool that is accessed to respond to user data requests.
12. The self-organizing data marketplace of claim 8, wherein the metric of success comprises a rating selected from: a user rating, a purchaser rating, a licensee rating, or a reviewer rating.
13. The self-organizing data marketplace of claim 8, wherein the metric of success comprises an indicator of interest selected from: a clickstream activity relating to the data pool, a time spent on a page relating to the data pool, a time spent reviewing data elements, or links to data elements of the data pool.
14. The self-organizing data marketplace of claim 1, wherein providing the portion of the self-organized data is a notification based on a criticality of the at least one corresponding conveyor in the industrial environment that provided the collected detection value causing the notification.
15. The self-organizing data marketplace of claim 14, wherein the notification is based on a policy.
16. A method of self-organizing a data marketplace, comprising: collecting detection values from a plurality of data collectors, wherein each of the plurality of data collectors is structured to collect detection values from at least one sensor of a corresponding one of a plurality of conveyors; storing a data pool in a data storage comprising at least a portion of the detection values, wherein the detection values comprise at least one of a rate of rotation of a power roller of the conveyor, a load being transported by the power roller, a power amount consumed by the power roller, or a rate of acceleration of the power roller; self-organizing the data pool; interpreting a user data request by a transaction system; and selectively providing a portion of the self-organized data to a user in response to the user data request.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein providing is in response to an authorization.
18. The method of claim 16, wherein providing is in response to a payment or subscription verification.
19. An apparatus, comprising: a plurality of data collectors and a corresponding plurality of conveyors, wherein each of the plurality of data collectors is structured to collect detection values from at least one sensor from a power roller of one of the corresponding plurality of conveyors; a data storage structured to store a data pool comprising at least a portion of the detection values; a data marketplace structured to self-organize the data pool, wherein the data marketplace is automatically configured based on training a self-organizing facility with a training set and feedback from measures of marketplace success; and a transaction system structured to interpret a user data request, and to selectively provide a portion of the data pool to a user in response to the user data request.
20. The apparatus of claim 19, wherein the at least one sensor is structured to detect a condition of the power roller comprising at least one of: a rate of rotation of the power roller, a load being transported by the power roller, a power amount consumed by the power roller, or a rate of acceleration of the power roller.
