THERAPY MONITORING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A method for monitoring a patient undergoing therapy includes wirelessly tracking a motion of the patient over time to generate a sequence of data representing the motion of the patient over time, processing the sequence of data representing the motion of the patient over time using a biometric parameter extraction module to extract data representing one or more biometric parameters, determining an estimated response of the patient to the therapy based at least in part of the data representing one or more biometric parameters, and providing a characterization of the estimated response of the patient to the therapy to one or more of a caretaker, the patient, or a clinician.

<claims>
1. A method for monitoring a patient undergoing therapy, the method comprising: wirelessly tracking a motion of the patient over time to generate a sequence of data representing the motion of the patient over time; processing the sequence of data representing the motion of the patient over time using a biometric parameter extraction module to extract data representing one or more biometric parameters; determining an estimated response of the patient to the therapy based at least in part of the data representing one or more biometric parameters, and providing a characterization of the estimated response of the patient to the therapy to one or more of a caretaker, the patient, or a clinician.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein wirelessly tracking the motion of the patient over time includes tracking the motion of the patent using a radio frequency-based motion tracking system.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein the radio frequency-based motion tracking system includes an FMCW radar motion tracking system.
4. The method of claim 2 wherein the radio frequency-based motion tracking system is configured to emit radio frequency signals and to receive radio frequency signals.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein wireless tracking the motion of the patient over time includes tracking the motion of the patient using reflections of electromagnetic signals from the patient.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein wireless tracking the motion of the patient over time includes tracking the motion of the patient using reflections of ultrasonic signals from the patient.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein extracting one or more biometric parameters from the motion of the patient includes extracting one or more of location, pose, gait, mobility, activity, breathing, heartrate, emotion, and sleep patterns.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein determining the estimated response of the patient to the therapy includes processing the one or more biometric parameters using a model configured to determine the estimated response of the patient to the therapy based on the one or more biometric parameters.
9. The method of claim 8 wherein the model includes an artificial neural network.
10. The method of claim 1 wherein wirelessly tracking the motion of the patient over time includes determining a sequence of observations of a position of the patient over time.
11. The method of claim 10 wherein extracting the one or more biometric parameters from the motion of the patient includes determining a progression the one or more biometric parameters over time.
12. The method of claim 1 wherein determining the estimated response of the patient to the therapy includes determining that the patient has a subtherapeutic response to the therapy.
13. The method of claim 1 wherein determining the estimated response of the patient to the therapy includes determining that the patient has a toxic response to the therapy.
14. The method of claim 1 wherein determining the estimated response of the patient to the therapy includes identifying dose dependent adverse effects to the therapy suffered by the patient.
15. The method of claim 1 wherein determining the estimated response of the patient to the therapy includes identifying withdrawal effects of the therapy suffered by the patient.
16. The method of claim 1 wherein determining the estimated response of the patient to the therapy includes identifying one or more of drug dosing changes or alterations, drug dose increase, drug dose decrease, wearing off of a drug, drug initiation or cessation, drug-drug interactions, drug-food interactions, drug abuse, drug misuse, and illicit drug use.
17. The method of claim 1 further comprising determining a compliance to the therapy by the patient based at least in part on the estimated response of the patient to the therapy.
18. The method of claim 1 wherein the therapy includes a single or multiple drug therapy.
19. A system for monitoring a patient undergoing therapy, the system comprising: a wireless sensor for wirelessly tracking a motion of the patient over time to generate a sequence of data representing the motion of the patient over time; a biometric parameter extraction module for processing the sequence of data representing the motion of the patient over time to extract data representing one or more biometric parameters; a therapy response model for determining an estimated response of the patient to the therapy based at least in part of the data representing one or more biometric parameters, and an output providing a characterization of the estimated response of the patient to the therapy to one or more of a caretaker, the patient, or a clinician.
20. Software stored in non-transitory form on a machine-readable medium, for monitoring a patient undergoing therapy, the software including instructions for causing a computing system to: wirelessly track a motion of the patient over time to generate a sequence of data representing the motion of the patient over time; process the sequence of data representing the motion of the patient over time using a biometric parameter extraction module to extract data representing one or more biometric parameters; determine an estimated response of the patient to the therapy based at least in part of the data representing one or more biometric parameters, and provide a characterization of the estimated response of the patient to the therapy to one or more of a caretaker, the patient, or a clinician.
