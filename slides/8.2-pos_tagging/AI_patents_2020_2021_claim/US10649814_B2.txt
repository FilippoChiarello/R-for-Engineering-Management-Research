<claims>
1. An information processing device comprising: a memory that stores information indicating a virtual address space for data to be processed; and a processor that executes, via the virtual address space, a given process on the data to be processed, monitors access from the processor to multiple monitoring regions among a plurality of regions included in the virtual address space and have been set as targets to be monitored, and executes given control based on an accessed monitoring region among the multiple monitoring regions and for which the access has been detected by the processor.
2. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the multiple monitoring regions are set so that the multiple monitoring regions are not adjacent to each other in the virtual address space, wherein the processor accesses the plurality of regions included in the virtual address space in given order in the given process, and wherein when the processor protects the multiple monitoring regions before the start of the given process and a control signal indicating access to a protected monitoring region is generated after the start of the given process, the processor identifies the accessed monitoring region based on the control signal and a virtual address of the identified monitoring region.
3. The information processing device according to claim 2, wherein the processor cancels the protection of the identified monitoring region and monitors access to a next monitoring region, and wherein the processor executes the given process by accessing the monitoring region for which the protection has been canceled.
4. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the data to be processed is distributed and stored in multiple storage devices connected to the information processing device via a communication network, wherein the memory stores data corresponding to a region among the plurality of regions included in the virtual address space, and wherein the processor estimates, based on an accessed virtual address for which the access has been detected by the processor, an address range of virtual addresses to be accessed by the processor, transmits a data transfer request to a storage device which stores partial data of the estimated address range among the multiple storage devices, and causes the partial data received from the storage device which stores the partial data to be stored in the memory.
5. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the data to be processed is to be transferred from a first process to a second process, wherein the memory stores data corresponding to a region among the plurality of regions included in the virtual address space, wherein the processor controls the first process to cause the first process to write the data to be processed to the memory, wherein the processor controls the second process to cause the second process to read the data to be processed from the memory, and wherein the processor causes, based on an accessed virtual address for which the access has been detected by the processor, the first process to write data to be transferred to the second process.
6. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the memory stores data corresponding to a region among the plurality of regions included in the virtual address space and stores association relationships between virtual addresses to be accessed by the processor in the given process and identification information indicating behaviors of the processor in the given process, and wherein the processor outputs, based on the association relationships, identification information associated with an accessed virtual address for which the access has been detected by the processor.
7. An information processing method comprising: causing a computer to execute, via a virtual address space for data to be processed, a given process on the data to be processed; monitoring, with the computer, access to multiple monitoring regions that are among a plurality of regions included in the virtual address space and have been set as targets to be monitored; and executing, with the computer, given control based on a virtual address of an accessed monitoring region that is among the multiple monitoring regions and for which the access has been detected.
8. The information processing method according to claim 7, further comprising: setting the multiple monitoring regions so that the multiple monitoring regions are not adjacent to each other in the virtual address space; protecting the multiple monitoring regions before the start of the given process; accessing the plurality of regions included in the virtual address space in given order in the given process; generating a control signal when the monitoring indicates access to a protected monitoring region; and identifying the accessed monitoring region based on the control signal and a virtual address of the identified monitoring region.
9. The information processing method according to claim 8, further comprising: canceling the protection of the identified monitoring region; the monitoring monitors access to a next monitoring region; and the accessing accesses the monitoring region for which the protection has been canceled.
10. The information processing method according to claim 7, further comprising: storing the data to be processed in a distributed manner in multiple storage devices connected to the computer via a communication network the computer includes a memory which stores data corresponding to a region among the plurality of regions included in the virtual address space; estimating, based on an accessed virtual address for which the access has been detected, an address range of virtual addresses to be accessed; transmitting a data transfer request to a storage device which stores partial data of the estimated address range among the multiple storage devices; and causing the partial data received from the storage device which stores the partial data to be stored in the memory.
11. A non-transitory, computer-readable recording medium having stored therein a program for causing a computer to execute a process, the process comprising: executing, via a virtual address space for data to be processed, a given process on the data to be processed; monitoring access to multiple monitoring regions that are among a plurality of regions included in the virtual address space and have been set as targets to be monitored; and executing given control based on a virtual address of an accessed monitoring region that is among the multiple monitoring regions and for which the access has been detected.
12. The non-transitory, computer-readable recording medium according to claim 11, the process further comprising: setting the multiple monitoring regions so that the multiple monitoring regions are not adjacent to each other in the virtual address space; protecting the multiple monitoring regions before the start of the given process; accessing the plurality of regions included in the virtual address space in given order in the given process; generating a control signal when the monitoring indicates access to a protected monitoring region; and identifying the accessed monitoring region based on the control signal and a virtual address of the identified monitoring region.
