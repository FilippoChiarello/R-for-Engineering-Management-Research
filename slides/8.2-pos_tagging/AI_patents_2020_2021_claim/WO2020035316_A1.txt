A WEED CONTROL SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a weed control apparatus (10) for a vehicle. It is described to provide (210) a processing unit with at least one image of an environment. The processing unit analyses (220) the at least one image to activate at least one chemical spray unit. At least one chemical spray unit atomizes and charges (230) a liquid chemical. The at least one chemical spray unit has at least one part configured to be held at high voltage with respect to zero volts potential. The at least one high voltage power supply and the at least one chemical spray unit are configured to hold the at least one part of the at least one chemical spray unit at a high voltage with respect to zero volts potential, such that the atomized liquid chemical is electrically charged. The at least one chemical spray unit is located within or on at least one unmanned aerial vehicle. Each unmanned aerial vehicle has a chemical spray unit. At least one liquid chemical reservoir is configured to hold a liquid chemical. The at least one chemical spray unit is in liquid communication with the at least one liquid chemical reservoir. The at least one unmanned aerial vehicle is in electrical connection with a ground based housing unit.
