SYSTEM WITH WEARABLE SENSOR FOR DETECTING EEG RESPONSE
</title>

<abstract>
A system in which a head-mountable wearable device detects a real-time electroencephalographic (EEG) response from a user while the user is performing an activity or exposed to an external stimulus in a real-world (non-clinical) setting. The wearable device performs on-board processing of a detected EEG signal to enable efficient data wireless transfer to a processing unit (e.g. on a smartphone or the like). The processing unit transforms the EEG signal in real time into a meaningful indicator of current mental state, and presents indicator to the user, e.g. in a form able to improve their performance of the activity, promote complementary activities or to enhance or alter their mental state.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: a head-mountable wearable sensor comprising: a sensor array arranged to detect an electroencephalographic (EEG) signal from a user wearing the wearable sensor; a filter module arranged to recognise and remove artefact waveforms from the EEG signal to generate a filtered EEG signal; and a communication unit wirelessly transmitting the filtered EEG signal; and a processing unit arranged to receive the filtered EEG signal transmitted from the head-mountable wearable sensor, wherein the processing unit comprises an analyser module arranged to generate, based on the filtered EEG signal, output data that is indicative of mental state information for the user, and wherein the wearable sensor is incorporated into headgear worn by the user exposed to a real world and/or virtual reality external stimulus, whereby the output data provides real-time mental state information for the user while exposed to the external stimulus.
2. The system according to claim 1, wherein the filter module is arranged to apply a recognition algorithm to the EEG signal to filter out waveforms associated with certain artefacts, and wherein the filter module is adapted to update the recognition algorithm using specific waveform for each type of artefact obtained for the user.
3. The system according to claim 1, wherein the processing unit comprises a correlator module arranged to correlate the mental state information with the external stimulus.
4. The system according to claim 3, wherein the processing unit is arranged to time stamp the mental state information, and arranged to synchronise the time stamped mental state information with data indicative of the external stimulus.
5. The system according to claim 4, wherein the data indicative of the external stimulus comprises a time series of annotatable events that correspond to the external stimulus.
6. The system according to claim 3, wherein the external stimulus comprising exposure to media content, and wherein the correlator module is arranged synchronise the mental state information with the media content.
7. The system according to claim 3, comprising a repository for storing the correlated mental state information.
8. The system according to claim 1 further comprising a portable computing device arranged to execute a user interface application to enable user interaction with the output data.
9. The system according to claim 8, wherein the processing unit is part of the portable computing device.
10. The system according to claim 8, wherein the user interface application is arranged to recommend a rating for the external stimulus based on the output data.
11. The system according to claim 8, wherein the user interface application is arranged to suggest user action based on the output data.
12. The system according to claim 11, wherein the suggested user action comprises any one or more of: playback of media content, streaming of media content, participation in an activity, and selection or purchase of a retail item or retail service.
13. The system according to claim 8, wherein the user interface application is arranged to compare current output data with historical output data for the user.
14. The system according to claim 1, wherein the analyser module comprises a model configured to map data from the filtered EEG signal onto a mental state vector, wherein the model is adaptive to learn how the user's individual EEG signals map on to emotional state information.
15. The system according to claim 14, wherein the mental state vector comprises components that are each indicative of an intensity value or probability for a respective emotional state or mental process.
16. The system according to claim 14, wherein the data from the filtered EEG signal comprises first data indicative of asymmetry in the Alpha and Beta EEG bands across the left hemispheric bank and second data indicative of asymmetry in the Alpha and Beta EEG bands across the right hemispheric bank.
