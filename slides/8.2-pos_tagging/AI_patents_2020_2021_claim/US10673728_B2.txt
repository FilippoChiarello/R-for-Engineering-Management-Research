<title>
Dynamic selection of models for hybrid network assurance architectures
</title>

<abstract>
In one embodiment, a local service of a network reports configuration information regarding the network to a cloud-based network assurance service. The local service receives a classifier selected by the cloud-based network assurance service based on the configuration information regarding the network. The local service classifies, using the received classifier, telemetry data collected from the network, to select a modeling strategy for the network. The local service installs, based on the modeling strategy for the network, a machine learning-based model to the local service for monitoring the network.
