<abstract>
A discrete wavelet transform-based noise removal apparatus and a remote medical diagnosis system using the same. The discrete wavelet transform-based noise removal apparatus can effectively remove noise from various medical images including ultrasound images, images indicative of results of biological or chemical reaction on a bio-disc, images obtained by medical devices, and images for telemedicine.
