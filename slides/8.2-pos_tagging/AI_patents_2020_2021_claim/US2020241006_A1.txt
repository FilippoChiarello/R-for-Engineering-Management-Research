METHODS FOR MONITORING VEDOLIZUMAB TREATMENT
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosure provides a method for predicting that a subject having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will have a clinical response or remission to an anti-α4β7 integrin during the course of therapy by assessing the concentration of the anti-α4β7 integrin drug at the induction or maintenance phase, respectively in a sample from the subject. The disclosure also provides a method for predicting whether a subject having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will be a remitter to an anti-α4β7 integrin drug treatment regimen by detecting the presence or level of at least one predictive marker.

<claims>
1. A method for predicting that a subject having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will have a clinical response to an anti-α4β7 integrin drug or reach remission during the course of therapy, the method comprising: (a) administering to a subject having IBD an anti-α4β7 integrin drug during an induction phase; (b) assessing the concentration of the anti-α4β7 integrin drug at the induction phase in a sample from the subject; and (c) determining whether the subject will have a clinical response or reach remission at a later time point based upon the concentration of the anti-α4β7 integrin drug at the induction phase.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the inflammatory bowel disease is ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's Disease (CD).
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the anti-α4β7 integrin drug is ENTYVIO® (vedolizumab, VDZ).
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the induction phase is between week 0 and week 6 of the course of therapy.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the later time point is at weeks 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20. 22, 24, 30, 32, 40, 48, or 52 during the course of therapy.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein a concentration of VDZ of ≥23.2 μg/ml at week 2 is associated with a clinical response or remission at week 14, 22, 30 and 52.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein a concentration of VDZ of ≥19.8 μg/ml at week 6 is associated with a clinical response or remission at week 14, 22, 30 and 52.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the clinical response or remission is a member selected from the group consisting of steroid free remission, clinical remission, normalized C-reactive protein (CRP), no steroid use in 4 weeks, and endoscopic remission.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein a concentration of VDZ is negatively correlated to concentration of CRP at week 14 and 22.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the concentration of VDZ at induction is used to identify a subject that will have a clinical response or reach remission.
11. A method for predicting that a subject having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) being administered an anti-α4β7 integrin drug therapy will reach remission, the method comprising: (a) assessing the concentration of the anti-α4β7 integrin drug in a sample from the subject during a maintenance phase; and (b) determining whether the subject will reach remission at a later time point based upon the concentration of the anti-α4β7 integrin drug during the maintenance phase.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the inflammatory bowel disease is ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's Disease (CD).
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the anti-α4β7 integrin drug is ENTYVIO® (vedolizumab, VDZ).
14. The method of claim 11, wherein an induction phase is between week 0 and week 6 of the course of therapy, and the maintenance phase is after 6 weeks.
15. The method of claim 11, wherein the remission is a member selected from the group consisting of steroid free remission, clinical remission, normalized C-reactive protein (CRP), no steroid use in 4 weeks, and endoscopic remission.
16. The method of claim 11, wherein a concentration of VDZ of ≥12 μg/ml after week 6 is associated with remission at week 14, 22, 30, and 52, or later.
17. The method of claim 11, wherein a concentration of VDZ of ≥13 μg/ml after week 6 is associated with remission at week 14, 22, 30, and 52, or later.
18. The method of claim 11, wherein a concentration of VDZ of ≥14 μg/ml after week 6 is associated with remission at week 14, 22, 30, and 52, or later.
19. The method of claim 11, wherein a concentration of VDZ of ≥15 μg/ml after week 6 is associated with remission at week 14, 22, 30, and 52, or later.
20. A method for predicting whether a subject having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will be a remitter to an anti-α4β7 integrin drug treatment regimen, the method comprising: (a) detecting the presence or level of at least one predictive marker selected from the group consisting of s-TNFα, s-α4β7, s-MAdCAM-1, s-CRP, s-AA, s-VCAM-1, s-ICAM-1, and a combination thereof, in a sample from the subject; and (b) classifying the subject as a remitter or a non-remitter to the anti-α4β7 integrin drug treatment according to a predictive marker profile based on a higher or lower level of the at least one predictive marker compared to a corresponding reference value.
21. The method of claim 20, wherein the inflammatory bowel disease is ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's Disease (CD).
22. The method of claim 20, wherein the anti-α4β7 integrin drug is ENTYVIO® (vedolizumab, VDZ).
23. The method of claim 20, wherein s-α4β7 is increased in remitters.
24. The method of claim 20, wherein one or more members selected from the group consisting of s-TNFα, s-MAdCAM-1, s-ICAM-1, and s-VCAM-1 is lower in remitters.
25. The method of claim 20, wherein during induction time points, s-TNFα concentrations are lower in remitters.
26. The method of claim 20, wherein during maintenance time points, s-α4β7 is higher in remitters and s-VCAM-1 is lower in remitters.
27. The method of claim 20, wherein the method includes least two predictive markers.
28. The method of claim 20, wherein the method includes least three predictive markers.
29. The method of claim 20, wherein the method includes least four predictive markers.
30. The method of claim 20, wherein the method includes least five predictive markers.
31. The method of claim 20, wherein the method includes least six predictive markers.
32. The method of claim 20, wherein the method includes seven predictive markers.
