<title>
Mining System
</title>

<abstract>
The current invention relates to mining systems and mine planning and in particular, to operating a mine that automatically updates a mine plan. The mining system directs operation of mining equipment within a mine based on a mine plan that schedules operations in the mine. The system further includes a mining planning system for updating the mine plan by a learning module configured to determine an inferencing model from initial data obtained from a data input module. The inferencing model is then evaluated by an estimation module using the initial data and the measurement data wherein such evaluation provides a fusion model. Consequently, a mine planner module determines an updated mine plan based on an existing mine plan and the fusion model. Based on the updated mine plan, the mining system directs operation of the mining equipment within the mine.

<claims>
1. A mining system for directing operation of mining equipment within a mine based on a mine plan that schedules operations in the mine, the system including: a mine planning system for updating the mine plan, the mine planning system including: a data input module providing initial data, and measurement data; a data processing module including: a learning module configured to determine an inferencing model from the initial data; and an estimation module configured to evaluate the inferencing model using the initial data and the measurement data, wherein thus evaluating the inferencing model provides a fusion model; and a mine planner module that determines an updated mine plan based on an existing mine plan and the fusion model, wherein the mining system directs operation of the mining equipment within the mine based on the updated mine plan.
2. The mining system of claim 1, wherein the measurement data includes a plurality of data sets with varying dimensionality.
3. The mining system of claim 2, wherein the estimation module accommodates the plurality of data sets with varying dimensionality by using a unified data representation.
4. The mining system of claim 1, wherein the learning module is further configured to update the inferencing model based on the measurement data.
5. The mining system of claim 4, wherein updating the inferencing model includes updating one or more model parameters of the inferencing model.
6. The mining system of claim 4 further including a validator module that assesses the fusion model in view of the measurement data to prompt the learning module to update the inferencing model.
7. The mining system of claim 1, wherein the measurement data includes production measurement data obtained continuously during operation of the mine.
8. The mining system of claim 1, wherein the estimation module estimates an updated orebody model based on the fusion model, and wherein the mine planner module uses the updated orebody model to determine the updated mine plan.
9. The mining system of claim 1, wherein the initial data includes exploration data and measurement data.
10. A method of directing operation of mining equipment within a mine based on a mine plan that schedules operations in the mine, the method including: updating the mine plan, the updating including: receiving initial data; determining an inferencing model and its model parameters from the initial data; receiving measurement data; using the received measurement data and the initial data to evaluate the inferencing model to determine a fusion model; and determining an updated mine plan based on the mine plan and the fusion model; and directing operation of the mining equipment based on the updated mine plan.
11. The method of claim 10 further including updating an orebody model from the fusion model, and wherein determining the updated mine plan is also based on the updated orebody model.
12. The method of claim 11 further including validating the fusion model in view of the measurement data to provide a validation measure, and prompting the updating based on the validation measure.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein the initial data includes exploration data.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein the measurement data includes production measurement data received continually during operation of the mine.
15. The method of claim 10, wherein the measurement data includes a plurality of data sets with varying dimensionality.
