</title>

<abstract>
According to one embodiment, a medical image processing apparatus includes an acquirer, a first processor and a second processor. The acquirer is configured to acquire nonequispaced sampled data from a test object. The first processor is configured to derive product-sums of the nonequispaced sampled data acquired by the acquirer and a plurality of coefficient sets and generate equispaced sampled data including a plurality of elements with which the product-sums derived for the coefficient sets are associated as element values. The second processor is configured to generate a medical image in which at least part of the test object has been imaged through reconstruction basis on the equispaced sampled data generated by the first processor.
