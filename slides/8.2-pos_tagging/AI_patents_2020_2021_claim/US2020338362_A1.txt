<title>
Apparatus to Facilitate the Administration of a Knowledge-Based Radiation Treatment Plan
</title>

<abstract>
A control circuit accesses information regarding a plurality of pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans for a variety of patients and uses that information to train at least one model (such as a dose volume histogram estimation model). The control circuit then uses that model to develop estimates for a radiation treatment plan for a particular patient. The control circuit can then use those estimates to develop a candidate radiation treatment plan.

<claims>
1. An apparatus comprising: a memory having stored therein information regarding a plurality of pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans for a variety of patients; a control circuit operably coupled to the memory and configured to: identify outlier data in the information; avoid relying upon at least some of the outlier data while training at least one model; develop estimates for a radiation treatment plan for a particular patient as a function, at least in part, of the at least one model.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the information regarding the plurality of pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans for a variety of patients constitutes an abridged version of each of the pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans such that the information is anonymous and not intrinsically correlated to any of the patients.
3. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein at least some of the plurality of pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans have original formats that are different from one another and wherein the information regarding the plurality of pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans presents contents of the pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans in a single consistent format.
4. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the control circuit is configured to identify the outlier data in the information, at least in part, as a function of dose volume histogram estimation training algorithm parameters.
5. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the control circuit is configured to identify the outlier data in the information, at least in part, as a function of dose volume histogram graphs.
6. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the control circuit is configured to identify the outlier data in the information, at least in part, as a function of regression lines corresponding to regression analysis data sets.
7. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the control circuit is configured to identify the outlier data in the information, at least in part, as a function of a numerical index for each of the pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans.
8. The apparatus of claim 7 wherein the control circuit is configured to calculate each of the numerical indexes as a function of a plurality of independent parameters calculated for each of the pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans.
9. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the control circuit is configured to identify the outlier data in the information, at least in part, as a function of identifying at least one of: a geometric outlier; a dosimetric outlier; and an influence point outlier.
10. A method comprising: providing a memory having stored therein information regarding a plurality of pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans for a variety of patients; by a control circuit operably coupled to the memory: identifying outlier data in the information; avoiding relying upon at least some of the outlier data while training at least one model; developing estimates for a radiation treatment plan for a particular patient as a function, at least in part, of the at least one model.
11. The method of claim 10 wherein the information regarding the plurality of pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans for a variety of patients constitutes an abridged version of each of the pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans such that the information is anonymous and not intrinsically correlated to any of the patients.
12. The method of claim 10 wherein at least some of the plurality of pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans have original formats that are different from one another and wherein the information regarding the plurality of pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans presents contents of the pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans in a single consistent format.
13. The method of claim 10 wherein identifying the outlier data in the information comprises identifying the outlier data in the information, at least in part, as a function of dose volume histogram estimation training algorithm parameters.
14. The method of claim 10 wherein identifying the outlier data in the information comprises identifying the outlier data in the information, at least in part, as a function of dose volume histogram graphs.
15. The method of claim 10 wherein identifying the outlier data in the information comprises identifying the outlier data in the information, at least in part, as a function of regression lines corresponding to regression analysis data sets.
16. The method of claim 10 wherein identifying the outlier data in the information comprises identifying the outlier data in the information, at least in part, as a function of a numerical index for each of the pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans.
17. The method of claim 16 further comprising calculating each of the numerical indexes as a function of a plurality of independent parameters calculated for each of the pre-existing vetted radiation treatment plans.
18. The method of claim 10 wherein identifying the outlier data in the information comprises identifying the outlier data in the information, at least in part, as a function of identifying at least one of: a geometric outlier; a dosimetric outlier; and an influence point outlier.
