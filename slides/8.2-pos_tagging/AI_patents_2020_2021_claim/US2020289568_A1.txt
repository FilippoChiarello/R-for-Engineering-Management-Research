DETERMINISTIC MECHANOPORATION FOR CELL ENGINEERING
</title>

<abstract>
Intracellular delivery of a genetic construct to immune cells including: obtaining a deterministic mechanoporation (DMP) platform that includes a substrate having a surface and a plurality of capture sites, each said capture site having a boundary shape at the surface adapted and configured to support thereon a cell, and each said capture site having a bottom and including a sub-micron-scale projection extending from the bottom toward the surface of the substrate, wherein said projection is adapted and configured to penetrate a cell membrane and/or wall of the cell, and wherein the substrate has a plurality of aspiration vias situated at the bottom of the capture sites; introducing the cells to the surface in a liquid media; capturing the cells within the capture sites by applying a first hydrodynamic force; applying a second hydrodynamic force on the captured cell and locally rupturing the membrane and/or wall of the cell with the projection, introducing the genetic construct into the cells, and releasing the porated cells from the capture sites. Also disclosed are methods of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell adoptive immunotherapy and T cell receptor (TCR) therapy.

<claims>
1. A method of intracellular delivery of a genetic construct to immune cells comprising: obtaining a deterministic mechanoporation (DMP) platform that comprises a substrate having a surface and a plurality of capture sites, each said capture site having a boundary shape at the surface adapted and configured to support thereon a cell, and each said capture site having a bottom and including a sub-micron-scale projection extending from the bottom toward the surface of the substrate, wherein said projection is adapted and configured to penetrate a cell membrane and/or wall of the cell, and wherein the substrate has a plurality of aspiration vias situated at the bottom of the capture sites; introducing the cells to the surface in a liquid media; capturing the cells within the capture sites by applying a first hydrodynamic force; applying a second hydrodynamic force on the captured cell and locally rupturing the membrane and/or wall of the cell with the projection, introducing the genetic construct into the cells, and releasing the porated cells from the capture sites.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the immune cells are T cells.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein the T cells are primary human T cells.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein a mean transfection yield of the immune cells is from 20-100%.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein a transfection yield of the immune cells is 2-fold to 20-fold higher than a transfection yield obtainable by bulk electroporation.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein the genetic construct encodes a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes a specific antigen, wherein the CAR comprises an extracellular antigen recognition domain, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic signaling domain that stimulates the immune cells to target and attack cells expressing the specific antigen.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein the genetic construct encodes a T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes a specific peptide displayed in the context of MHC II molecules, wherein the TCR is involved in a pathway that stimulates immune cells to target and attack cells expressing an antigen that contains the specific peptide.
8. The method according to claim 1, wherein the substrate of the DMP platform has greater than 106 capture sites.
9. The method according to claim 1, wherein a flow rate of the liquid media containing the cells is adjusted to a first flow rate during capture to achieve a capture site occupancy of at least 50%.
10. The method according to claim 9, wherein a second flow rate of the liquid media containing the cells during application of the second hydrodynamic force is different compared to the first flow rate during capture.
11. The method according to claim 1, wherein a mean transfection yield of the cells is between 50-100%.
12. The method according to claim 1, wherein a mean transfection yield of the cells is between 75-100%.
13. The method according to claim 1, wherein a mean transfection yield of the cells is between 90-100%.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the projection has a length comparable to the radius of the cells.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the genetic construct is introduced into the nucleus of the cells.
16. A method of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell adoptive immunotherapy in a patient comprising: obtaining T cells transfected with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene by the method of claim 1, wherein the CAR recognizes a cell surface antigen of a tumor cell, and administering the cells to the patient.
17. The method according to claim 16, wherein the patient is treated for a disease selected from the group consisting of a cancer, an infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, transplant rejection and autoimmunity.
18. The method according to claim 16, wherein the patient is treated for a cancer.
19. The method according to claim 18, wherein the cancer is a non-blood or non-hematopoietic based cancer, a solid tumor forming or infiltrating/metastatic cancer, or a cancer selected from the group consisting of a bone cancer, an endocrine cancer, a germ cell cancer, a kidney cancer, a liver cancer, a neuroblastoma and a soft tissue cancer.
20. The method of claim 16, wherein the T cells are autologous to the patient.
21. The method of claim 20, wherein the autologous T cells are administered intravenously as a bolus dose.
22. The method of claim 16, wherein the T cells are allogenic to the patient.
23. The method of claim 22 wherein the allogenic T cells are administered intravenously as a bolus dose.
24. A method of T cell receptor (TCR) therapy in a subject comprising: obtaining T cells transfected with a T cell receptor gene by the method of claim 1, wherein the T cell receptor recognizes a specific peptide displayed in the context of MHC II molecules on antigen presenting cells, and administering the cells to the subject.
25. The method according to claim 24, wherein the patient is treated for a disease selected from the group consisting of a cancer, an infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, transplant rejection and autoimmunity.
