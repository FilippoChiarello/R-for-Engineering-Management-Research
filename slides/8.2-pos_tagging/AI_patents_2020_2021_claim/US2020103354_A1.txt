<title>
DEVICE AND METHOD FOR PERCEIVING AN ACTUAL SITUATION IN AN INTERIOR OF A PEOPLE MOVER
</title>

<abstract>
A device for perceiving an actual state of an interior of a people mover may include at least one imaging sensor for perceiving the actual state of the interior and an evaluation device that is configured to obtain a target state of the interior. The evaluation device may be configured to compare the actual state with the target state in order to determine a difference between the actual state and the target state, and wherein the evaluation device is configured to generate a signal for informing an operator of the people mover of the actual state based on the difference. An interface may also be included for sending the signal to the operator.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A device for perceiving an actual state of an interior of a people mover, the device comprising: at least one imaging sensor for perceiving the actual state of the interior; an evaluation device that is configured to obtain a target state of the interior, wherein the evaluation device is configured to compare the actual state with the target state in order to determine a difference between the actual state and the target state, and wherein the evaluation device is configured to generate a signal for informing an operator of the people mover of the actual state based on the difference; and an interface for sending the signal to the operator.
2. The device according to claim 1, wherein the evaluation system is configured to execute an image recognition algorithm, and wherein image recognition algorithm software code segments are included for recognizing cleanliness and/or damages in the image of the interior.
3. The device according to claim 2, wherein the evaluation system is configured to determine the extent of cleanliness a of the interior based on the comparison of the actual state with the target state.
4. The device according to claim 2, wherein the evaluation system is configured to determine the extent of damage of the interior based on the comparison of the actual state with the target state.
5. The device according to claim 1, wherein the evaluation system is configured to determine the difference between the actual state and the target state using artificial intelligence.
6. The device according to claim 1, wherein the signal is an acoustic signal.
7. The device according to claim 1, wherein the signal is a visual signal.
8. A method for perceiving an actual state of an interior of a people mover, the method comprising the steps of: perceiving an actual state of the interior with an imaging sensor; obtaining a target state of the interior; comparing the actual state with the target state; determining a difference between the actual state and the target state; generating a signal for informing an operator of the people mover of the actual state based on the difference; and sending the signal to the operator.
9. A device for perceiving an actual state of an interior of a people mover, the device comprising: a camera; at least one imaging sensor within the camera for generating an image of the actual state of the interior; an evaluation device that is configured to obtain a target state of the interior, wherein the evaluation device is configured to compare the actual state with the target state in order to determine a difference between the actual state and the target state; and an interface for sending at least one of a visual and acoustic signal to an operator of the people mover when the actual state is different than the target state.
10. The device according to claim 9, wherein the evaluation system is configured to execute an image recognition algorithm, and wherein image recognition algorithm software code segments are included for recognizing cleanliness and/or damages in the image of the interior.
11. The device according to claim 10, wherein the evaluation system is configured to determine the extent of cleanliness of the interior based on the comparison of the actual state with the target state.
12. The device according to claim 10, wherein the evaluation system is configured to determine the extent of damage of the interior based on the comparison of the actual state with the target state.
13. The device according to claim 9, wherein the evaluation system is configured to determine the difference between the actual state and the target state using artificial intelligence.
