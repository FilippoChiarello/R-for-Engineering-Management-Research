APPARATUS AND METHOD OF DETECTING POTENTIAL SECURITY VIOLATIONS OF DIRECT ACCESS NON-VOLATILE MEMORY DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus and method of providing direct access to a non-volatile memory of a non-volatile memory device and detecting potential security violations are provided. A method for providing access to a non-volatile memory of a non-volatile memory device may include tracking a parameter related to a plurality of direct access transactions of the non-volatile memory. A threshold behavior pattern of the host activity may be determined based upon the tracked parameters. The direct access transactions may be reviewed to determine whether the threshold behavior pattern is exceeded.
