<title>
System and method of single-zone duct control
</title>

<abstract>
A system for controlling airflow into a single room includes a duct having a controllable damper, fluidly connected to the room, a controller connected to the damper, configured to open and close the damper, at least one sensor communicatively connected to the controller, positioned in the room and configured to measure a parameter in the room, at least one portable computing device communicatively connected to the sensor and the controller, and control logic stored as instructions on a non-transitory computer readable medium, the instructions configured to open and close the damper in response to a measurement received from the at least one sensor. A method for controlling a damper in a duct fluidly connected to a room is also described.

<claims>
1. A system for controlling airflow into a single room, comprising: a duct having a controllable damper, fluidly connected to the room, the damper positioned in the duct outside the room, along an airflow path connected to the room; a controller connected to the damper, configured to open and close the damper; at least one sensor communicatively connected to the controller, positioned in the room and configured to measure a parameter in the room; at least one portable computing device communicatively connected to the sensor and the controller; and control logic stored as instructions on a non-transitory computer readable medium, the instructions configured to open and close the damper in response to a measurement received from the at least one sensor.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one sensor comprises a sensor selected from the group consisting of a temperature sensor and a motion sensor.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one sensor is disposed within an object selected from the group consisting of a light fixture, a smoke detector, a ceiling tile, and a wall plate cover.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the portable computing device is a smartphone.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the non-transitory computer-readable medium containing the control logic is disposed within the smartphone.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the control logic comprises an interface for manual control of the damper.
7. The system of claim 4, wherein the smartphone is configured to pair with the at least one sensor when placed near the at least one sensor.
8. The system of claim 4, wherein the at least one sensor comprises one sensor electrically connected to the smartphone.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one portable computing device comprises two portable computing devices.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one sensor and the non-transitory computer-readable medium containing the control logic are disposed within a sensor assembly.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the sensor assembly further comprises at least one control element selected from the group consisting of a button, dial, switch, and touchscreen.
12. A method of controlling a damper in a duct fluidly connected to a room, comprising: providing a damper in a duct, the damper positioned outside a room upstream from a vent positioned in the room; measuring at least one parameter from at least one sensor positioned in the room; communicating the measurement of the at least one parameter to a central controller; determining a damper action with the central controller based on the at least one parameter; communicating the damper action from the central controller to the damper; and actuating the damper in accordance with the determined damper action.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the at least one sensor is selected from the group consisting of a sound sensor, a range sensor, and an RF sensor.
14. The method of claim 12, further comprising the steps of: receiving an instruction from a user via a portable electronic device; and modifying the damper action based on the instruction from the user.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the portable electronic device is a smartphone.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the at least one sensor is electrically connected to the smartphone.
17. The method of claim 14, wherein the instruction is an instruction to open or close the damper.
18. The method of claim 12, wherein the at least one sensor is a temperature sensor, the at least one parameter is a temperature measurement, and the method further comprises the step of comparing the temperature measurement to a temperature threshold.
19. The system of claim 1, wherein the non-transitory computer-readable medium is connected to a central controller executed in a cloud instance remote from the room.
