Vehicle accident image processing method and apparatus
</title>

<abstract>
N vehicle accident images are obtained, where N is a natural number greater than or equal to 2. N feature vectors are obtained by inputting the vehicle accident images into a trained convolutional neural network, where the N feature vectors respectively correspond to the vehicle accident images. A distance is calculated between any two feature vectors of the N feature vectors. A determination is made that two vehicle accident images of the N vehicle accident images corresponding to the distance are abnormal when the distance is greater than a first predetermined threshold.
