<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving device status data from a mobile device prior to a support session being initiated; determining one or more potential faults related to the mobile device based at least in part of the device status data; determining whether to escalate to a support session facilitated by a customer service representative, wherein the determination whether to escalate to a support session facilitated by a customer service representative is based at least in part on the one or more potential faults related to the mobile device and the device status data; selecting a particular customer service representative to assign to the support session based at least in part on information regarding a plurality of customer support representatives, the one or more potential faults related to the mobile device and the device status data; assigning the particular customer service representative to the support session; and providing a record of the received device status data and an identification of the one or more potential faults to the assigned customer service representative.
2. The method of Claim 1, further comprising determining a sophistication level of a user of the mobile device based at least in part on the device status data.
3. The method of Claim 2, wherein determining whether to escalate to a support session facilitated by the customer service representative is further based on the sophistication level of the user.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the device status data further comprises information regarding one or more corrective actions performed by a user of the mobile device prior to the support session being initiated.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the information regarding the one or more corrective actions performed by the user of the mobile device comprises information regarding support information accessed by the user.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the information regarding support information accessed by the user comprises one or more indications of the user's satisfaction with the accessed support information.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein the information regarding one or more corrective actions performed by the user of the mobile device comprise indications of one or more corrective actions performed by the user.

9. The method of claim 7, wherein the one or more corrective actions performed by the user comprise one or more actions performed in accordance with accessed support information.
10. An apparatus comprising at least one processor and at least one memory coupled to the processor, wherein the processor is configured to: receive device status data from a mobile device prior to a support session being initiated, wherein the device status data comprises a set of system log information and a set of device usage information; determine one or more potential faults related to the mobile device based at least in part of the device status data; determine whether to escalate to a support session facilitated by a customer service representative based at least in part on the one or more potential faults related to the mobile device, wherein the determination whether to escalate to a support session facilitated by a customer service representative is based at least in part on the one or more potential faults related to the mobile device and the device status data; select a particular customer service representative to assign to the support session based at least in part on information regarding a plurality of customer support representatives and the one or more potential faults related to the mobile device; assign the particular customer service representative to the support session; and provide a record of the received device status data and an identification of the one or more potential faults to the assigned customer service representative.
11. The apparatus of Claim 10, wherein the processor is further configured to determine a sophistication level of a user of the mobile device based at least in part on the device status data.
12. The apparatus of Claim 11, wherein determining whether to escalate to a support session facilitated by the customer service representative is further based on the sophistication level of the user.
13. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the device status data further comprises information regarding one or more corrective actions performed by a user of the mobile device prior to the support session being initiated.
14. The apparatus of claim 13, wherein the information regarding one or more corrective actions performed by the user of the mobile device comprises indications of one or more corrective actions performed by the user.
15. The apparatus of claim 13, wherein the one or more corrective actions performed by the user comprises one or more actions performed in accordance with accessed support information.
