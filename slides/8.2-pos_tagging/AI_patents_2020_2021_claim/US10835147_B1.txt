<title>
Method for predicting efficacy of a stimulus by measuring physiological response to stimuli
</title>

<abstract>
Methods are disclosed for determining an efficacy of a stimulus based on one or more measurable physiological responses to one or more stimuli including one or more stimulus features. Data is acquired on physiological responses of a group of one or more subjects to presentation of one or more stimuli including one or more stimulus features. The data on the one or more physiological responses of the one or more subjects is correlated with the presentation of the one or more stimulus features included in the one or more stimuli. The correlated data on the one or more physiological responses are associated with a separately-determined efficacy of the one or more stimuli to form a stimulus efficacy model. From this information, a projected efficacy of a stimulus is determinable by comparing one or more subsequently-measured physiological responses to the stimulus with the stimulus efficacy model.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method to determine an efficacy of a stimulus, the method comprising: providing a computing system comprising an output device and an input device operatively coupled to one or more sensors; subjecting one or more subjects to one or more stimuli displayed on the output device; acquiring at least a first set of data and a second set of data by: measuring, via the one or more sensors, one or more physiological responses to the one or more stimuli including one or more stimulus features; recording via the one or more sensors the one or more physiological responses measured, wherein the first set of data is associated with the one or more stimulus features of at least one of the one or more stimuli presented to the one or more subjects and the second set of data is associated with the one or more physiological responses of the one or more subjects to presentation of the one or more stimuli including the one or more stimulus features; wherein the first set of data includes weighted, extracted stimulus feature data comprising data associated with the one or more stimulus features during presentation of the respective stimuli and captured as a function of time and further weighted via a first filter comprising a temporal element; wherein the second set of data includes weighted, physiological response data comprising data associated with the one or more physiological responses measured and recorded via the one or more sensors and weighted via a second filter comprising a spatial element; correlating the first and second sets of data, the data in the first set having been weighted by the first filter comprising the temporal element and the data in the second set having been weighted by the second filter comprising the spatial element; associating the correlated data with a separately-determined efficacy of the one or more stimuli to form a stimulus efficacy model; and determining a projected efficacy of a second stimulus by comparing one or more subsequently-measured physiological response to the stimulus with the stimulus efficacy model.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the measuring of the one or more physiological responses to the one or more stimuli including the one or more stimulus features includes one or more of: electroencephalography (EEG); electrocardiography (EKG); galvanic skin response; heart rate monitoring; respiration rate monitoring; eye tracking; and pupillometry.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the correlating of the data on the one or more physiological responses of the one or more subjects with the presentation of the one or more stimulus features included in the one or more stimuli includes forming a first data matrix tracking the presentation of each of the one or more stimuli including the one or more stimulus features over a period of time during which the one or more stimuli are presented.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the correlating of the data on the one or more physiological responses of the one or more subjects with the presentation of the one or more stimulus features included in the one or more stimuli includes forming a second data matrix representing a quantified measure of each of the one or more physiological responses over the time period over which the one or more stimuli are presented.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more stimuli include at least one of one or more audio stimuli and one or more visual stimuli.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the one or more stimuli include one or more audio stimuli, and the one or more stimulus features include at least one of: pitch trajectory; sound envelope; speech envelope; spectral power; rhythm; volume; and pitch.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein the one or more stimuli include one or more visual stimuli, and the one or more stimulus features include at least one of: orientation energy; optical flow; luminance; chrominance; local spatial contrast; and temporal contrast.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising quantifying a magnitude of the one or more stimulus features included in the one or more stimuli.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the quantified magnitude of the one or more stimulus features is collected by a feature extractor.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the separately-determined efficacy of the one or more stimuli is determined from at least one of the one or more subjects and an additional group of one or more subjects regarding one or more subjective responses to the one or more stimuli.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the separately-determined efficacy of the one or more stimuli ascertained is determined by one or more of: polling the one or more subjects regarding a subjective response to the one or more stimuli; interviewing the one or more subjects individually and as part of a group regarding the one or more stimuli; observing reactions of the one or more subjects during the presentation of the one or more stimuli; and measuring subject performance on a skills test during and subsequent to presentation of the one or more stimuli.
