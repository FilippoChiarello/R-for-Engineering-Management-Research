<title>
ADDING NEW ELECTRONIC EVENTS INTO AN ELECTRONIC USER PROFILE USING A LANGUAGE-INDEPENDENT DATA FORMAT
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides a computer-implemented method of graphically representing events relating to a plurality of users. The method comprises: graphically representing a knowledge base, the knowledge base comprising concepts that are linked by relations; receiving a plurality of interim graphs each relating to an event, said interim graphs each comprising a plurality of nodes including a node identifying the user associated with the event and a node identifying a concept describing an outcome of the event; linking the plurality of interim graphs with the knowledge base to form a relation between the nodes in the interim graphs identifying the concepts and corresponding concepts in the knowledge base to produce a graphical representation of a user profile including the knowledge base augmented with the interim graphs relating to a plurality of users.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method of graphically representing events relating to a plurality of users, the method comprising: graphically representing a knowledge base, the knowledge base comprising nodes defining concepts, and edges linking the concepts, wherein each concept represents an element selected from a list including: a subject of a semantic triple, a property of a semantic triple, and an object of a semantic triple, the semantic triple being derived from unstructured text; receiving a plurality of interim graphs each relating to an event, said interim graphs each comprising a plurality of nodes including a node identifying a user associated with the event and a node identifying a concept describing an outcome of the event; linking the plurality of interim graphs with the knowledge base by forming an edge between the nodes in the interim graphs identifying the concepts and corresponding concepts in the knowledge base to produce a graphical representation of a user profile including the knowledge base augmented with the interim graphs relating to a plurality of users.
2. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the interim graphs each relate to a different user.
3. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the interim graphs are anonymised.
4. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the plurality of nodes also includes one or more of a node representing an event identifier, a node representing a time stamp of when the event took place, and a node representing a location of the event.
5. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the method further comprises: receiving a new event including data describing a consultation with one of the plurality of users of a conversation module of the diagnostic system; encoding the new event using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON); storing the encoded new event in a queue of events; decoding and translating the new event into a form compatible with one or more of the plurality of interim graphs; and adding the translated new event to the interim graph.
6. The computer-implemented method according to claim 5, further comprising: searching the queue of events for any new events in response to a request to build the user profile; and in response to identifying a new event in the queue of events, decoding and translating the event into a form compatible with said one or more of the plurality of interim graphs.
7. A computer-implemented method of extracting information concerning a plurality of users, the method comprising: the method of claim 1, receiving a query to extract information from the user profile, the information including a plurality of users, interrogating the user profile to identify a plurality of nodes associated with the plurality of users, and to extract information from nodes linked to the plurality of nodes associated with the plurality of users, and returning the extracted information for the plurality of users.
8. The computer-implemented method according to claim 7, wherein said information concerning the plurality of users includes one or more of a concept, a location of the event, and a time stamp of the event.
9. The computer-implemented method according to claim 7, wherein the step of returning the extracted information for the plurality of users includes filtering the extracted information to include only information relating to the query.
10. The computer-implemented method according to claim 7, wherein interrogating the user profile to identify a plurality of nodes associated with the plurality of users includes identifying the plurality of nodes within a pre-determined branch factor.
11. A non-transitory computer-readable medium, storing instructions, that when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform the method according to any preceding claim.
