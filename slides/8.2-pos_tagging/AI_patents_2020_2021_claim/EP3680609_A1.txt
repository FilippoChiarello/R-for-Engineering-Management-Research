3. The method for measuring an antenna downtilt angle based on a multi-scale deep semantic segmentation network according to claim 2, wherein the step of predicting a target bounding box comprises: positioning a target antenna in the antenna image, predicting a bounding box by logistic regression, first dividing the entire antenna image into N*N grids, predicting the entire antenna image after the antenna image is input, scanning each grid at a time, and starting to predict the target antenna when the center of the grid where the target antenna is located is positioned, wherein four coordinate values predicted for each bounding box are tx, ty, tw, and th, respectively, an upper-left offset of each target cell is (cx, cy), box heights of the bounding boxes are px, py respectively, and the network predicts their values as: where the input antenna image is divided into N*N grids, each grid comprises 5 predictors (x, y, w, h, confidence) and a c class, and the output of the network is of a size of S*S*(5*B+C); B is the number of the bounding boxes in each grid, C means the class is only antenna in the present disclosure, and thus is 1, and confidence represents that the predicted grid comprises two pieces of information, i.e., confidence of the target antenna and prediction accuracy of the bounding box: a threshold is set to 0.5 when Pr(Object)=1; the target antenna falls in the center of the grid, that is, the bounding box currently predicted coincides with an actual background box object better than before; if the predicted bounding box is not the best currently, the bounding box is not predicted when the threshold is smaller than 0.5, so as to determine that the target antenna does not fall into the grid.
