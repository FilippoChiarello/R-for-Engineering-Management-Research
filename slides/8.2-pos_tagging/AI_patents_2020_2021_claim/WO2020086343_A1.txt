<title>
PRIVACY AWARENESS FOR PERSONAL ASSISTANT COMMUNICATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the technology described herein maintain the privacy of confidential information to be communicated to a user through a computing device. The technology keeps confidential information private by assessing the privacy context of the communication. The privacy context can be determined by determining a privacy level of the information to be communicated and the privacy level of the environment into which the information is to be communicated. The privacy context can be used to select an appropriate communication channel for the information. The privacy context can also be used to determine whether all available content is shared or just a portion of it.

<claims>
1. A method for preserving privacy of information output from a computing device located in an environment, comprising:
receiving, by the computing device, a request from a user;
determining an identity of the user;
generating a response to the request comprising a content that is responsive to the request based on the identity of the user;
determining a content privacy level for the content;
determining an environmental privacy level for the environment of the computing device;
determining a privacy context for communicating the content using both the environmental privacy level the content privacy level;
selecting a first communication channel for communicating the response to the request based on the privacy context;
generating a modified response by redacting confidential information from the content; and
providing the modified response over the first communication channel.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the modified response indicates that additional information responsive to the request is available to the user over a second communication channel.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the environmental privacy level is determined to be public, friendly, or private, and wherein the content privacy level is determined to be public, sensitive, or private.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the privacy context is determined to be secure when the environmental privacy level is equal to or exceeds the content privacy level and the privacy context is determined to be unsecure when the content privacy level exceeds the environmental privacy level.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the privacy context is determined to be at risk when the environmental privacy level is friendly and the content privacy level is sensitive.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the modified response further comprises:
determining a generalized descriptor that characterizes at least a portion of the confidential information; and
altering the response by replacing the confidential information with the generalized descriptor.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the environmental privacy level comprises determining that at least a second person is physically or virtually present in the environment.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein determining the environmental privacy level further comprises determining an identity of the second person, and wherein determining the content privacy level is further based on the identity of the second person.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein determining the content privacy level is further based on the identity of the second person comprises determining that the second person has access to the content.
10. A method for preserving privacy of information output from a computing device located in an environment, comprising:
determining a content privacy level for a communication to be output from a digital personal assistant having a default communication channel for communicating with the user;
determining an environmental privacy level for the environment of the computing device;
determining a privacy context for communicating the communication using both the environmental privacy level the content privacy level;
selecting a second communication channel for outputting the communication to a user in response to determining the privacy context is classified as unsecure, wherein the second communication channel is not the default communication channel;
outputting the communication to the user through the second communication channel;
generating a notification for the default communication channel that directs the user to the second communication channel; and
outputting the notification to the user through the default communication channel.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the notification includes a modified version of the communication that redacts confidential information from the communication.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein the second communication channel is a display screen on a second device associated with the user.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein determining the environmental privacy level comprises determining that at least a second person is physically or virtually present in the environment.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein the environmental privacy level is determined to be public, friendly, or private, and wherein the content privacy level is determined to be public, sensitive, or private.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the privacy context is determined to be unsecure when the content privacy level exceeds the environmental privacy level.
