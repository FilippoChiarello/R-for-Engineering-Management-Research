METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR IDENTIFYING OR MONITORING LUNG DISEASE
</title>

<abstract>
Provided herein are methods, systems, and kits for improving the current clinical pathway of care for lung conditions using genomic classifiers at various decision points within the existing pathway to minimize unnecessary invasive procedures, enhance early detection and disease recurrence, and monitor efficacy of interventive therapies for prevention or disease reversal.

<claims>
1. A method for screening a subject for a lung condition, comprising: (a) assaying epithelial tissue from a first sample obtained from a subject that has been (1) computer analyzed for a presence of one or more risk factors for developing said lung condition and (2) identified with said presence of said one or more risk factors, to identify a presence or absence of one or more biomarkers associated with a risk of developing said lung condition in said first sample; and (b) upon identifying said presence or absence of said one or more biomarkers, (i) directing an electronic imaging scan of a lung region of said subject to be obtained, which lung region is suspected of exhibiting said lung condition, or (ii) assaying other epithelial tissue from a second sample of said subject.
2. (canceled)
3. The method of claim 1, wherein said electronic imaging scan is a low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MM).
4. (canceled)
5. The method of claim 1, wherein said lung condition is lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD), or any combination thereof.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein said lung condition is a lung cancer, and wherein said lung cancer comprises: a non-small cell lung cancer; an adenocarcinoma; a squamous cell carcinoma; a large cell carcinoma; a small cell lung cancer; or any combination thereof.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein said first sample or said second sample is obtained by a bronchoscopy, bronchial brushing, or nasal brushing.
8. (canceled)
9. The method of claim 1, wherein said first sample or said second sample comprises a mucous epithelial tissue, a nasal epithelial tissue, a lung epithelial tissue, or any combination thereof.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein said first sample or said second sample comprises epithelial tissue obtained along an airway of said subject.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein a portion of said first sample or said second sample is subjected to cytological testing that identifies said first sample or said second sample as ambiguous or suspicious.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein upon identifying said first sample or said second sample as ambiguous or suspicious, performing (b) on a second portion of said sample, which second portion comprises said epithelial tissue.
13. (canceled)
14. The method of claim 1, wherein said second sample is a different sample type from said first sample.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein said first sample is obtained from said subject at a first time point and said second sample is obtained from said subject at a second time point, wherein said second time point is after said first time point.
16. (canceled)
17. The method of claim 1, wherein (a) comprises comparing said presence or absence of said one or more biomarkers to a reference set of one or more biomarkers.
18. (canceled)
19. (canceled)
20. (canceled)
21. (canceled)
22. (canceled)
23. The method of claim 1, wherein said one or more risk factors comprise: smoking; exposure to environmental smoke; exposure to radon; exposure to air pollution; exposure to radiation; exposure to an industrial substance; inherited or environmentally-acquired gene mutations; a subject's age; a subject having a secondary health condition; or any combination thereof.
24. (canceled)
25. (canceled)
26. The method of claim 1, wherein said one or more biomarkers comprise one or more of: a gene or fragment thereof; a sequence variant; a fusion; a mitochondrial transcript; an epigenetic modification; a copy number variation; a loss of heterozygosity (LOH); or any combination thereof.
27. The method of claim 1, wherein said presence or absence of said one or more biomarkers comprises a level of expression.
28. The method of claim 1, wherein said method identifies whether said subject is at an increased risk for developing said lung condition.
29. The method of claim 1, wherein said identifying of (b) comprises employing a trained algorithm.
30. The method of claim 29, wherein said trained algorithm is trained by a training set comprising epithelial cells obtained from an airway of an individual.
31. The method of claim 29, wherein said trained algorithm is trained by a training set comprising samples benign for said lung condition and samples malignant for said lung condition.
32. The method of claim 29, wherein said trained algorithm is trained by a training set comprising samples obtained from subjects having one or more risk factors.
33. 33.-60. (canceled)
