<title>
DYNAMIC COMMUNICATIONS ROUTING TO DISPARATE ENDPOINTS
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates generally to facilitating routing of communications. More specifically, techniques are provided to dynamically routing messages having multiple intents between bots and terminal devices during communication sessions configured with multi-channel capabilities.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: receiving one or more variables associated with a client device, wherein the client device is operated by a client; receiving a message for the client from a network device, wherein the message includes a first intent and a second intent; parsing the message to identify the first intent and the second intent, wherein the first intent is associated with a first actionable item and the second intent is associated with a second actionable item; analyzing the first intent and the second intent to determine a prioritization for executing the first actionable item and the second actionable item, wherein the prioritization indicates that the first actionable item should be executed first and the second actionable item should be executed second; feeding the first intent and the second intent into a machine learning model, wherein the machine learning model identifies a first endpoint for the first intent and a second endpoint for the second intent by optimizing the one or more variables associated with the client device; routing the first intent to the first endpoint, wherein the first endpoint thereafter executes the first actionable item; and routing the second intent to the second endpoint, wherein the second endpoint thereafter executes the second actionable item.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the first endpoint is a bot.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the first endpoint is a terminal device, and wherein the terminal device is operated by an agent.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the first endpoint is a bot and the second endpoint is a terminal device, and wherein the terminal device is operated by an agent.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the message is in natural language.
6. A computer-program product tangibly embodied in a non-transitory machine-readable storage medium, including instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform operations including: receiving one or more variables associated with a client device, wherein the client device is operated by a client; receiving a message for the client from a network device, wherein the message includes a first intent and a second intent; parsing the message to identify the first intent and the second intent, wherein the first intent is associated with a first actionable item and the second intent is associated with a second actionable item; analyzing the first intent and the second intent to determine a prioritization for executing the first actionable item and the second actionable item, wherein the prioritization indicates that the first actionable item should be executed first and the second actionable item should be executed second; feeding the first intent and the second intent into a machine learning model, wherein the machine learning model identifies a first endpoint for the first intent and a second endpoint for the second intent by optimizing the one or more variables associated with the client device; routing the first intent to the first endpoint, wherein the first endpoint thereafter executes the first actionable item; and routing the second intent to the second endpoint, wherein the second endpoint thereafter executes the second actionable item.
7. The computer-program product of claim 6, wherein the first endpoint is a bot.
8. The computer-program product of claim 6, wherein the first endpoint is a terminal device, and wherein the terminal device is operated by an agent.
9. The computer-program product of claim 6, wherein the first endpoint is a bot and the second endpoint is a terminal device, and wherein the terminal device is operated by an agent.
10. The computer-program product of claim 6, wherein the message is in natural language.
11. A system comprising: one or more processors; and one or more non-transitory machine-readable storage media containing instructions that, when executed on the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform operations including: receiving one or more variables associated with a client device, wherein the client device is operated by a client; receiving a message for the client from a network device, wherein the message includes a first intent and a second intent; parsing the message to identify the first intent and the second intent, wherein the first intent is associated with a first actionable item and the second intent is associated with a second actionable item; analyzing the first intent and the second intent to determine a prioritization for executing the first actionable item and the second actionable item, wherein the prioritization indicates that the first actionable item should be executed first and the second actionable item should be executed second; feeding the first intent and the second intent into a machine learning model, wherein the machine learning model identifies a first endpoint for the first intent and a second endpoint for the second intent by optimizing the one or more variables associated with the client device; routing the first intent to the first endpoint, wherein the first endpoint thereafter executes the first actionable item; and routing the second intent to the second endpoint, wherein the second endpoint thereafter executes the second actionable item.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the first endpoint is a bot.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the first endpoint is a terminal device, and wherein the terminal device is operated by an agent.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the first endpoint is a bot and the second endpoint is a terminal device, and wherein the terminal device is operated by an agent.
15. The system of claim 11, wherein the message is in natural language.
