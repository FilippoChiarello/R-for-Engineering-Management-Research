<title>
Weight and vision based item tracking
</title>

<abstract>
This disclosure describes a system for processing an image of an item and correctly identifying the item from a group of candidate items. In one implementation, as item image information for a new item is added to an item images data store, a determination is made as to the weight of the item represented by the image, and the item may be associated with a weight class. Each weight class represents items within a defined weight range. Item image information for items in the same weight class may then be used when new items are added to inventory and/or when identifying an item represented in an image.
