<title>
SYSTEM AND METHODS FOR PROCESSING SPATIAL DATA
</title>

<abstract>
A system for processing spatial data may be designed to receive neural network outputs corresponding to a first spatial data set, and translate the neural network outputs corresponding to the first spatial data set based on the motion between a second spatial data set and the first spatial data set. The system may perform zero-gap run length encoding on the neural network outputs to store the neural network outputs in memory. The system may also perform on-the-fly skip zero decoding and bilinear interpolation to translate the neural network outputs.
