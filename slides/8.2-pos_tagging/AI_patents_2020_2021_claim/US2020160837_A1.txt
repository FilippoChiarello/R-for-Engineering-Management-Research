METHOD FOR CONTROLLING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM THAT PERFORMS MULTILINGUAL PROCESSING
</title>

<abstract>
This specification relates to a method for controlling an artificial intelligence system which performs a multilingual processing based on artificial intelligence technology. The method for controlling an artificial intelligence system which performs a multilingual processing includes: receiving voice information through a microphone; determining a language of the voice information, based on a preset reference; selecting a specific voice recognition server from a plurality of voice recognition servers which process different languages, based on a result of the determination; and transmitting the voice information to the selected specific voice recognition server.

<claims>
1. A method for controlling a multilingual audio processing system, the method comprising: receiving voice information via a microphone; determining a first language of the received voice information, transmitting the received voice information to a first voice recognition server for determining an intent of the received voice information, wherein the first voice recognition server is associated with the first language; receiving intent information from the first voice recognition server, wherein the intent information indicates that the received voice information comprises a request to translate a portion of the voice information to a second language; transmitting the portion of the voice information to a second voice recognition server associated with the second language; receiving translation information of the portion of the voice information from the second voice recognition server; and outputting an output corresponding to the received translation information.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the output is in the form of an audio output.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the output is visually displayed on a display of a terminal associated with the system.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the first voice recognition server is selected based on the determination that the received voice information is in the first language.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein a different server is selected as the first voice recognition server for a different language from the first language.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the output corresponds to a response to a request included in the portion of the voice information.
7. A method for controlling a multilingual audio processing system, the method comprising: receiving voice information via a microphone; determining a first language of the received voice information; determining that the received voice information comprises a request to translate a portion of the received voice information to a second language; transmitting the portion of the received voice information to a first voice recognition server associated with the first language; receiving translated information from the first voice recognition server, wherein the translated information corresponds to a translation of the portion of the received voice information translated to the second language; transmitting the translated information to a second voice recognition server for processing; and outputting a processing result received from the second voice recognition server.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the processing result is output in the form of an audio output.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the processing result is visually output on a display of a terminal associated with the system.
10. The method of claim 7, wherein the first voice recognition server is selected based on the determination that the received voice information is in the first language.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein a different server is selected as the first voice recognition server for a different language from the first language.
12. The method of claim 7, wherein the processing result corresponds to a response to a request included in the portion of the voice information.
