<title>
METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR GENERATING A ROBOTIC PROGRAM FOR INDUSTRIAL COATING
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and a method predict a generation of a robotic program for industrial coating. Inputs are received including a virtual representation of a robot, a coating gun, elements of the object surface to be coated and a set of desired coating thickness ranges. Inputs on a coating dispersion object are also received. Training data of a plurality of robotic programs for industrial coating and of their corresponding coating thickness coverage on a plurality of surfaces are received. The training data are processed in x, y tuples so as to learn a mapping function to generate a coating prediction module. Starting with a given selected valid thickness coverage as input parameters, it is proceeded in an iterative manner to predict a robotic program via the coating prediction module. A coating robotic program is generated for each surface element based on the resulting predicted coating programs.
