Custom product imaging method
</title>

<abstract>
A networked product imaging system includes devices that provide the production of imaged goods. Sellers are easily integrated into the network with minimal or no inventory requirements. Customer requirements are provided to a central computing device (CCD) that has two-way communication with a plurality of geographically separated product image forming devices. The central computing device determines specifications for forming the image on the blank product in accordance with the customer's order. The central computing device selects a product image forming device from the plurality of geographically separated product forming devices for fulfilling the order, based upon factors that include the specification of the product image forming device available, the product image forming inventory and the blank product inventory available at the geographic location of the product image forming device. The selected product image forming device forms the image on the blank product at the remote location.

<claims>
1. A method for providing images on products using a system comprising: a plurality of geographically separated image forming devices, each geographically separated image forming device being capable of data communication with a central computing device so as to permit communication to the central computing device of a specification of the image forming device and an image forming inventory of materials with which the image may be formed and a blank product inventory associated with the image forming device and available to the image forming device; the method comprising the steps of: the central computing device creating a plurality of custom websites for a plurality of sellers, each website of the plurality of websites presenting a plurality of image choices and a plurality of blank product choices; selecting an image and a blank product upon which the image is to be formed through a website of a seller of the plurality of sellers; communicating the selected image and selected blank product to the central computing device; the central computing device determining specifications for forming the selected image on the selected blank product; the central computing device using the determined specifications to select an appropriate image forming device of the plurality of geographically separated image forming devices for forming the selected image on the selected blank product based upon the specification of the image forming device available, and the image forming inventory and the blank product inventory available at the geographic location of the image forming device; forming the selected image on the blank product at the remote location using the image forming device selected by the central computing device from the plurality of geographically separated image forming devices.
2. The product imaging method of claim 1, further comprising the step of each seller of the plurality of sellers providing a seller identifier to the central computing device prior to the central computing device creating the custom website for the seller.
3. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the central computing device creates the custom website from a library contained in a database of the central computing device.
4. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the central computing device creates the custom website by scraping other websites.
5. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the geographically remote image forming device comprises a printer and a computerized embroidery machine.
6. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the geographically remote image forming device comprises a printer and a computerized embroidery machine, and wherein the printer comprises an ink jet printer and a direct-to-garment printer.
7. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the geographically remote image forming device comprises a printer and a blank product cutter.
8. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the geographically remote image forming device comprises a printer and a blank product cutter and wherein the printer comprises an ink jet printer and a 3D printer.
9. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the geographically remote image forming device comprises a printer and a computerized engraving machine.
10. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the blank product inventory comprises ceramics and textiles.
11. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the blank product inventory comprises ceramics and garments.
12. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the blank product inventory comprises ceramics and metal.
13. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the blank product inventory comprises metal and textiles.
14. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the blank product inventory comprises metal and glass.
15. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the blank product inventory comprises metal and wood.
16. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the central computing device selects an image forming device based upon the geographic location of image forming inventory consisting of textile, ceramic and metal.
17. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the image forming inventory comprises sublimation ink.
18. The product imaging method of claim 1, wherein the image forming inventory comprises yarn and printer ink.
19. The product imaging method of claim 1, further comprising the step of the central computing device communicating a waveform specification to the image forming device.
20. The product imaging method of claim 1, further comprising the step of the central computing device communicating an image specification to the image forming device, and the image specification comprises visual graphics information, image size and image resolution.
