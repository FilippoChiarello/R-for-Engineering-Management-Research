<claims>
1. 1.-63. (canceled)
64. A genetically modified plant comprising a gene encoding an Lr67 polypeptide which comprises amino acids having a sequence at least 90% identical to the amino acid sequence of any one or more of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO:8 or SEQ ID NO:9, wherein the gene has a genetic modification such that the polypeptide does not comprise a glycine at a position corresponding to amino acid number 144 of SEQ ID NO:1.
65. The genetically modified plant of claim 64, wherein when expressed in the plant, the Lr67 polypeptide confers upon the plant resistance to one or more biotrophic fungal pathogen(s).
66. The genetically modified plant of claim 65, wherein the one or more biotrophic fungal pathogen(s) is selected from the group consisting of Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Fusarium graminearum, Bipolaris sorokiniana, Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, Puccinia striiformis, Puccinia hordei and Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici.
67. The genetically modified plant of claim 64, wherein the Lr67 polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence which is at least 95% identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:7.
68. The genetically modified plant of claim 64, wherein the Lr67 polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence which is at least 95% identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8.
69. The genetically modified plant of claim 64, wherein the Lr67 polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence which is at least 95% identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:9.
70. The genetically modified plant of claim 64, wherein the Lr67 polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence which is at least 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:7.
71. The genetically modified plant of claim 64, wherein the Lr67 polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence which is at least 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8.
72. The genetically modified plant of claim 64, wherein the Lr67 polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence which is at least 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:9.
73. The genetically modified plant of claim 64 which has enhanced resistance to one or more biotrophic fungal pathogen(s) when compared to an isogenic plant lacking the genetic modification.
74. The genetically modified plant of claim 64 which has enhanced resistance to one or more biotrophic fungal pathogen(s) at the seedling stage of growth.
75. The genetically modified plant of claim 64 which is a cereal, grape, beet or leguminous plant.
76. A genetically modified cell comprising a gene encoding an Lr67 polypeptide which comprises amino acids having a sequence at least 90% identical to the amino acid sequence of any one or more of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO:8 or SEQ ID NO:9, wherein the gene has a genetic modification such that the polypeptide does not comprise a glycine at a position corresponding to amino acid number 144 of SEQ ID NO:1.
77. The cell of claim 76 which is a plant cell.
78. The cell of claim 76 which is a yeast cell.
79. Seed of the genetically modified plant of claim 64 which comprises the gene.
80. Seed comprising the cell of claim 77.
81. A method of producing a plant part, the method comprising, a) growing a plant of claim 64, and b) harvesting the plant part.
82. A method of producing flour, wholemeal, starch or other product obtained from seed, the method comprising; a) obtaining seed of claim 79, and b) extracting the flour, wholemeal, starch or other product.
83. A method of producing flour, wholemeal, starch or other product obtained from seed, the method comprising; a) obtaining seed of claim 80, and b) extracting the flour, wholemeal, starch or other product.
84. A method of identifying a compound that binds to a polypeptide comprising amino acids having a sequence as provided in SEQ ID NO:1 or an amino acid sequence which is at least 90% identical to SEQ ID NO:1, a biologically active fragment thereof, the method comprising: i) contacting the polypeptide with a candidate compound, and ii) determining whether the compound binds the polypeptide.
