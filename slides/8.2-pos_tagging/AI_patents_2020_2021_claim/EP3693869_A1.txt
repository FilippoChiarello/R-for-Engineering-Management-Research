METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANAGING KNOWLEDGE BASE, DEVICE AND MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method and apparatus for managing a knowledge base, a device and a computer readable storage medium. The method for managing a knowledge base includes: forking, in response to receiving a request for modification of a rule for a first namespace, the rule to the first namespace, the rule being used to constrain structured data in a knowledge base; modifying, based on the request for modification of the rule, the rule in the first namespace; and adding the modified rule to a rule base associated with the knowledge base. Therefore, this scheme has good reusability and traceability while flexibly adapting to the requirements of different knowledge bases.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for managing a knowledge base, comprising: Forking (310), in response to receiving a request for modification of a rule for a first namespace, the rule to the first namespace, the rule being used to constrain structured data in the knowledge base; Modifying (320), based on the request for modification of the rule, the rule in the first namespace; and adding (330) the modified rule to a rule base associated with the knowledge base.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the forking the rule to the first namespace comprises:
forking the rule to the first namespace from at least one of following: the rule base, or a second namespace, the second namespace being different from the first namespace.
3. The method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the modifying the rule comprises: determining a rule modification mode for modifying the rule from the request for modification of the rule; and modifying, based on the rule modification mode, at least one of following: one of a plurality of entities contained in the rule, or a relationship between the plurality of entities.
4. The method according to any one of claims 1-3, wherein the adding the modified rule to a rule base associated with the knowledge base comprises:
adding, in response to receiving a request for adding the modified rule from the first namespace to the rule base, the modified rule to the rule base.
5. The method according to claim 4, wherein the adding the modified rule to a rule base associated with the knowledge base comprises: sending the request for adding the modified rule to the rule base; and adding, in response to receiving a response of allowing adding the modified rule to the rule base, the modified rule to the rule base.
6. The method according to any one of claims 1-5, further comprising:
providing, in response to receiving a request for use of the modified rule by a third namespace, the modified rule to the third namespace, the third namespace being different from the first namespace.
7. The method according to any one of claims 1-6, further comprising at least one of following: visually outputting the modified rule; or outputting the modified rule through a user programming interface.
8. An apparatus for managing a knowledge base, comprising: a forking module (410) configured to fork, in response to receiving a request for modification of a rule for a first namespace, the rule to the first namespace, the rule being used to constrain structured data in the knowledge base; a modification module (420) configured to modify, based on the request for modification of the rule, the rule in the first namespace; and an addition module (430) configured to add the modified rule to a rule base associated with the knowledge base.
9. The apparatus according to claim 8, wherein the forking module (410) comprises:
a rule forking module configured to fork the rule to the first namespace from at least one of following: the rule base, or a second namespace, the second namespace being different from the first namespace.
10. The apparatus according to claim 8 or 9, wherein the modification module (420) comprises: a determination module configured to determine a rule modification mode for modifying the rule from the request for modification of the rule; and a rule modification module configured to modify, based on the rule modification mode, at least one of following: one of a plurality of entities contained in the rule, or a relationship between the plurality of entities.
11. The apparatus according to any one of claims 8-10, wherein the addition module (430) comprises:
a rule addition module configured to add, in response to receiving a request for adding the modified rule from the first namespace to the rule base, the modified rule to the rule base.
12. The apparatus according to claim 11, wherein the rule addition module comprises: a sending module configured to send the request for adding the modified rule to the rule base; and a verification addition module configured to add, in response to receiving a response of allowing adding the modified rule to the rule base, the modified rule to the rule base.
13. The apparatus according to any one of claims 8-12, further comprising:
a provision module configured to provide, in response to receiving a request for use of the modified rule by a third namespace, the modified rule to the third namespace, the third namespace being different from the first namespace.
14. The apparatus according to any one of claims 8-13, further comprising at least one of following: a visual output module configured to visually output the modified rule; or a user programming interface output module configured to output the modified rule through a user programming interface.
15. A computer readable storage medium storing a computer program, wherein the program, when executed by a processor, implements the method according to any one of claims 1-7.
