<title>
DETECTION DEVICE AND METHOD FOR DETECTING MULTIPLE OBJECT DATA SETS OF AT LEAST ONE OBJECT
</title>

<abstract>
A detection device for an at least semiautomated detection of multiple object data sets of at least one object is provided. The detection device includes a movement device for generating a defined relative movement between at least one object data detection unit and the at least one object.

<claims>
1. 1-11. (canceled)
12. A detection device for an at least semiautomated detection of multiple object data sets of at least one object, comprising: a movement device configured to generate a defined relative movement between at least one object data detection unit and the at least one object.
13. The detection device as recited in claim 12, further comprising: at least one preprocessing unit configured to preprocess objects prior to a detection of data using the object data detection unit.
14. The detection device as recited in claim 12, further comprising: at least one detection unit situated at a preprocessing unit, the at least one detection unit configured to detect at least one parameter of the at least one object.
15. The detection device as recited in claim 14, wherein the at least one parameter includes a weight of the at least one object or a dimension to the at least one object.
16. The detection device as recited in claim 13, further comprising: at least one post-processing unit using which the at least one object is post-processed after a detection of data using the object data detection unit.
17. The detection device as recited in claim 12, further comprising: at least one object detection area; and at least one transport unit including at least one positioning unit configured to position the at least one object in the object detection area.
18. The detection device as recited in claim 17, wherein the at least one positioning unit includes a multiaxial robotic arm.
19. A system, comprising: a detection device configured for an at least semiautomated detection of multiple object data sets of at least one object, the detecting device including a movement device configured to generate a defined relative movement between at least one object data detection unit and the at least one object; a memory unit with data sets that are at least partially generated using the detection device; a mobile detection unit; and a processing unit configured to evaluate data that are detected with the mobile detection unit, at least taking the data sets of the memory unit into account.
20. A method for detecting multiple object data sets of at least one object, comprising the following steps: providing a system including a detection device configured for an at least semiautomated detection of multiple object data sets of at least one object, the detecting device including a movement device configured to generate a defined relative movement between at least one object data detection unit and the at least one object, a memory unit with data sets that are at least partially generated using the detection device, a mobile detection unit, and a processing unit configured to evaluate data that are detected with the mobile detection unit, at least taking the data sets of the memory unit into account; and using the system to detect multiple object data sets of the at least one object.
21. The method as recited in claim 20, wherein the method further comprising the following step: detecting at least one parameter of the object using a detection unit of the detection device, the detecting unit including a sensor unit, the detecting being performed prior to detecting image data of the at least one object.
22. The method as recited in claim 21, wherein the at least one parameter includes a weight of the at least one object or a dimension of the at least one object.
23. The method as recited in claim 20, wherein the method further comprises the following step: supplying the at least one object to an object detection area of the detection device by a preprocessing unit of the detection device, using a positioning unit of a transport unit of the detection device, prior to detecting image data of the at least one object.
24. The method as recited in claim 20, further comprising the following step: supplying the at least one object from an object detection area of the detection device to a post-processing unit of the detection device, using a positioning unit of a transport unit of the detection device or using a further positioning unit of the transport unit of the detection device, after detecting image data of the object.
