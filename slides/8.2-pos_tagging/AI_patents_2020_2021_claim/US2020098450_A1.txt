<abstract>
An activity of a target compound is suitably predicted based on a structure of the target compound. A predicting device includes: a generating unit that captures a structural model of the target compound relatively from a plurality of directions with a virtual camera to generate a plurality of captured images; and a predicting unit that uses a learning model to predict the activity of the target compound from the plurality of captured images generated by the generating unit.
