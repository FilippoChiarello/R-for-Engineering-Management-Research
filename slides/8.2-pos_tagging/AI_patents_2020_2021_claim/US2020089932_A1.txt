ON-LINE OIL AND FOREIGN MATTER DETECTION SYSTEM AND METHOD EMPLOYING HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING
</title>

<abstract>
A method for removing foreign matter from an agricultural product stream of a manufacturing process. The method includes conveying a product stream past an inspection station; scanning a region of the agricultural product stream as it passes the inspection station using at least one light source of a single or different wavelengths; generating hyperspectral images from the scanned region; determining a spectral fingerprint for the agricultural product stream from the hyperspectral images; comparing the spectral fingerprint obtained in step (c) to a spectral fingerprint database containing a plurality of fingerprints using a computer processor to determine whether foreign matter is present and, if present, generating a signal in response thereto; and removing a portion of the conveyed product stream in response to the signal. A system for detecting foreign matter within an agricultural product stream is also provided.

1. (canceled)
2. A method for detecting and removing foreign matter in an agricultural product stream of a manufacturing process, the method comprising: scanning a region of a product stream using a light source; generating a hyperspectral image in real time from the region; determining a product fingerprint from the hyperspectral image in real time; and determining in real time whether foreign matter is present in the product stream based on the product fingerprint and a hyperspectral fingerprint database containing a plurality of hyperspectral fingerprints using a computer processor; and removing a first portion of the product stream in response to determining foreign matter is present.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the removing includes directing fluid at the first portion of the product stream.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the directing fluid includes directing pulses of the fluid.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the directing fluid includes directing the fluid from a plurality of ejector nozzles, the plurality of ejector nozzles configured to be individually directed and controlled by the computer processor.
6. The method of claim 3, wherein the fluid is pressurized air.
7. The method of claim 3, wherein the fluid is water.
8. The method of claim 2, further comprising: collecting the first portion in a receptacle.
9. The method of claim 2, further comprising: conveying the product stream.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the conveying includes conveying the product stream on a vibrating conveyor.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the conveying includes conveying the product stream on an inclined conveyor.
12. The method of claim 9, further comprising: causing a second portion of the product stream to fall under the influence of gravity in a cascade.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the second portion of the product stream includes the first portion of the product stream.
14. The method of claim 12, wherein the cascade is a turbulent cascade.
15. The method of claim 12, wherein the causing is performed concurrently with the scanning.
16. The method of claim 2, further comprising: after the removing, conveying a remainder of the product stream on a conveyor.
17. The method of claim 2, wherein the light source includes a tungsten light source, a halogen light source, a xenon light source, a mercury light source, an ultraviolet light source, or any combinations thereof.
18. A method for detecting oil or lubricant in a tobacco product stream of a manufacturing process, the method comprising: scanning a region of the tobacco product stream using a light source; generating a hyperspectral image in real time from the region; determining a product fingerprint from the hyperspectral image in real time; and determining in real time whether oil or lubricant is present in the tobacco product stream based on the product fingerprint and a hyperspectral fingerprint database containing a plurality of hyperspectral fingerprints using a computer processor.
19. The method of claim 18, further comprising: causing a portion of the tobacco product stream to fall under the influence of gravity in a cascade, the causing being performed concurrently with the scanning.
20. The method of claim 18, further comprising: removing a portion of the tobacco product stream in response to the determining whether foreign matter is present.
21. The method of claim 20, further comprising: collecting the portion of the tobacco product stream.
