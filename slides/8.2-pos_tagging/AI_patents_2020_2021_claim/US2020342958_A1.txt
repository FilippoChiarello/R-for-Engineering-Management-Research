METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR ASSESSING INFLAMMATORY DISEASE WITH DEEP LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides methods and systems of identifying an inflammatory disease or condition, e.g., an inflammatory bowel disease in a subject using a DeepLearning model. The DeepLearning model may be used to predict, treat, monitor, and/or prevent the inflammatory disease or condition in the subject, as well as to characterize a subtype of the inflammatory disease or condition.

<claims>
1. A method for identifying an inflammatory disease or condition in a subject, comprising: (a) assaying a biological sample of the subject to generate a dataset comprising genetic data; (b) processing the dataset at a plurality of genomic loci to determine quantitative measures of each genomic locus of the plurality of genomic loci, wherein the plurality of genomic loci comprises inflammatory disease-associated genes, thereby producing an inflammatory disease profile of the biological sample of the subject; and (c) applying a deep learning prediction model to the inflammatory disease profile to identify a presence of the inflammatory disease or condition in the subject, or a likelihood that the subject will develop the inflammatory disease or condition.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the inflammatory disease or condition comprises an immune-mediated disease or condition.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the immune-mediated disease or condition comprises an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the IBD is Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein assaying the biological sample comprises sequencing the biological sample to generate the dataset.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising identifying the presence of the inflammatory disease or condition in the subject, or the likelihood that the subject will develop the inflammatory disease or condition, at a sensitivity of at least about 70%.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising identifying the presence of the inflammatory disease or condition in the subject, or the likelihood that the subject will develop the inflammatory disease or condition, at a specificity of at least about 70%.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising identifying the presence of the inflammatory disease or condition in the subject, or the likelihood that the subject will develop the inflammatory disease or condition, at a positive predictive value of at least about 70%.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising identifying the presence of the inflammatory disease or condition in the subject, or the likelihood that the subject will develop the inflammatory disease or condition, at a negative predictive value of at least about 70%.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising identifying the presence of the inflammatory disease or condition in the subject, or the likelihood that the subject will develop the inflammatory disease or condition, with an Area Under Curve of at least about 0.70.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the deep learning prediction model is trained using a first set of independent training samples associated with a presence of the inflammatory disease or condition and a second set of independent training samples associated with an absence of the inflammatory disease or condition.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising applying the deep learning prediction model to a set of clinical health data of the subject.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the deep learning prediction model comprises a deep learning algorithm, a neural network, a Random Forest, an XGBoost, a Gradient Boost, or a combination thereof.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the deep learning prediction model comprises a deep learning algorithm.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the deep learning algorithm comprises a deep neural network.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the deep neural network comprises a convolutional neural network (CNN).
17. The method of claim 16, further comprising optimizing a set of hyperparameters of the CNN.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein optimizing the set of hyperparameters comprises performing an intensive grid search.
19. The method of claim 17, wherein the set of hyperparameters comprises a number of layers and/or a number of neurons of the CNN.
20. The method of claim 16, wherein the CNN comprises a combination of a plurality of CNNs.
