MULTIPLE-INPUT MULTIPLE-OUTPUT (MIMO) DETECTOR SELECTION USING NEURAL NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detector selection using a neural network is herein disclosed. According to one embodiment, a method includes generating a labelled dataset of features and detector labels, training a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network using the generated labelled dataset, and selecting a detector class from a plurality of detector classes based on outputs of the trained MLP network.
