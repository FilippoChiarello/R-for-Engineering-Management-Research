WEAR LEVELING FOR NON-VOLATILE MEMORY USING DATA WRITE COUNTERS
</title>

<abstract>
A memory system has a controller (e.g., CPU, FPGA, or GPU) and recording segments in a non-volatile memory (e.g., a flash memory device) used by the controller to store data. The controller is configured to: maintain data write counters for the recording segments; select a first segment of the recording segments for recording data from a host system, wherein selecting the first segment comprises scanning the data write counters to identify a first data write counter corresponding to the first segment; receive, from the host system, data to be recorded by the non-volatile memory; and write the received data to the selected first segment.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for a controller, the method comprising: maintaining data write counters for recording segments of a non-volatile memory, wherein each of the data write counters corresponds to a respective recording segment; selecting a first segment of the recording segments for recording data from a host system, wherein selecting the first segment comprises scanning the data write counters to identify a first data write counter corresponding to the first segment; receiving, from the host system, data to be recorded by the non-volatile memory; and writing the received data to the first segment.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the host system is a black box recorder for an autonomous vehicle.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the received data is a data stream from the black box recorder.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising dividing the non-volatile memory into sets of physical blocks to provide the recording segments, each set of physical blocks corresponding to a recording segment.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein dividing the non-volatile memory provides recording segments of equal size.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying the first data write counter comprises comparing values of the data write counters.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein a value of the first data write counter is lower than a value of at least one other of the data write counters.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the value of the first data write counter is lower than values of all other of the data write counters.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising incrementing the first data write counter as the received data is written to the first segment.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the first data write counter is incremented based on a quantity of data written to the first segment.
11. A system comprising: at least one processing device; and memory storing instructions configured to instruct the at least one processing device to: maintain data write counters for recording segments of a non-volatile memory, wherein each of the data write counters corresponds to a respective recording segment; select a first segment of the recording segments for recording data from a host system, wherein selecting the first segment comprises scanning the data write counters to identify a first data write counter corresponding to the first segment; receive, from the host system, data to be recorded by the non-volatile memory; and write the received data to the first segment.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein each of the data write counters is incremented based on a quantity of data written to the recording segment corresponding to the respective data write counter.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the host system is a black box recorder for an autonomous vehicle, and the received data is a data stream from the black box recorder.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein writing the received data to the first segment comprises writing the data stream to the first segment in a cyclic mode.
15. The system of claim 13, wherein the host system starts sending the data to be recorded when the black box recorder receives a command to start recording, wherein the command to start recording is provided by a computing device of the autonomous vehicle, and wherein the computing device controls an autonomous navigation system.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the instructions are further configured to instruct the at least one processing device to: in response to the black box recorder receiving a command to stop recording, select a second segment of the recording segments for recording subsequent data received from the host system, wherein the second segment is selected based on comparing values of the data write counters; receive the subsequent data; and write the subsequent data to the second segment.
17. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that, when executed by at least one processing device, cause the at least one processing device to perform a method, the method comprising: maintaining data write counters for recording segments of a memory, wherein each of the data write counters corresponds to a respective recording segment; selecting a first segment of the recording segments for recording data, wherein selecting the first segment comprises scanning the data write counters to identify a first data write counter corresponding to the first segment; receiving data to be recorded by the memory; and writing the received data to the first segment.
18. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein writing the received data to the first segment comprises writing the data to the first segment in a cyclic mode.
19. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein the received data is a sequential data stream.
20. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein identifying the first data write counter comprises comparing values of the data write counters.
