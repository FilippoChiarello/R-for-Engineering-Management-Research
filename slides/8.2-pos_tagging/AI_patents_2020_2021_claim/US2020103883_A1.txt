INDICATOR DETECTION SYSTEM AND INDICATOR DETECTION METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An indicator detection system includes: a data acquiring unit configured to acquire operation data of a machine and operation history data indicating an operation history of the machine; an estimation unit configured to calculate a first estimated value of a parameter of the machine which is to be monitored on the basis of the operation data, the operation history data and an estimation model for estimating a value of the parameter at a time point corresponding to the operation history data for the parameter; and a state evaluating unit configured to evaluate a state of the machine on the basis of a difference between the first estimated value of the parameter from the estimation unit and a measured value or a second estimated value of the parameter included in the operation data acquired by the data acquiring unit.
