SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR LEVERAGING ACOUSTIC INFORMATION OF VOICE QUERIES
</title>

<abstract>
The methods and systems described herein leveraging acoustic features of a user to generate and present a personalized content to a user. In one example, the method receives a voice query and determines that the query refers to either a first content item or a second content item. The first content item is associated with a first type assigned with a first score and the second content item is associated with a second entity type assigned with a second score. The method also determines whether the query is from the second entity type. The method ranks the first and the second content items based on this determination and generates for presentation of the first and the second content items based on the ranking. The method also changes the first or the second scores based on this determination and selects one of the first or the second content item for presentation.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising:
receiving, by a control circuitry, a voice query;
identifying, by the control circuitry, a plurality of content items stored in a database that match the voice query, wherein the plurality of content items comprises:
a first content item having an associated first type and a first score, wherein the first type indicates the first content item is labeled for a first group, and the first score indicates a level of affinity of the first content item for members of the first group; and
a second content item having an associated second type and a second score, wherein the second type indicates the second content item is labeled for a second group different from the first group, and the second score indicates a level of affinity of the second content item for members of the second group;
receiving, by the control circuitry, a selection of one of the first content item or the second content item;
determining whether the voice query is from a member of the second group; in response to determining the voice query is not from a member of the second group and the selection is of the second content item, ranking, by the control circuitry, the first content item higher than the second content item for presentation;
in response to determining the voice query is from a member of the second group and the selection is of the first content item ranking, by the control circuitry, the second content item higher than the first content item for the presentation; and
generating, by the control circuitry, a presentation of one of the first content item or the second content item according to the ranking of the first and second content items.
2. The method of claim 1 further comprising:
in response to ranking the second content item higher than the first content item outputting the presentation of the second content item.
3. The method of any one of claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising: in response to ranking the first content item higher than the second content item outputting the presentation of the first content item.
4. The method of any one of claims 2-3, further comprising:
displaying the first content item and the second content item in response to determining that the voice query is not from the member of the second group.
5. The method of any one of claims 2-4, wherein each of the plurality of content items is assigned with a content identifier identifying the corresponding content item.
6. The method of any one of claims 2-5, wherein generating the presentation further comprising displaying each of the plurality of content identifiers according to the ranking of the content items.
7. The method of any one of claims 2-6, wherein the first content item is labeled for the first group based on genre and rating of the first content item.
8. The method of any one of claims 2-7, wherein the second content item is labeled for the second group based on genre and rating of the second content item.
9. The method of any one of claims 2-8, further comprising determining that the voice query refers to a third content item, wherein the third content item having an associated third type and a third score, wherein the third type indicates the third content item is labeled for a third group and the third score indicates a level of affinity of the third content item for members of the third group, wherein the members of the third group are one of a part of the members of the first and the second groups or not part of the members in the first group or the second group.
10. The method of any one of claims 2-9, wherein the third content item is labeled for the third group based on genre and rating of the third content item.
11. A system comprising: control circuitry configured to access a plurality of content items, wherein the plurality of content items comprises:
a first content item having an associated first type and a first score, wherein the first type indicates the first content item is labeled for first group, and the first score indicates a level of affinity of the first content item for members of the first group; and
a second content item having an associated second type and a second score, wherein the second type indicates the second content item is labeled for a second group different from the first group, and the second score indicates a level of affinity of the second content item for members of the second group; and means for implementing the steps of the method of any of claims 1 to 10.
12. A non-transitory computer-readable medium having instructions encoded thereon that when executed by control circuitry enable the control circuitry to execute the steps of the method of any of claims 1 to 10.
13. A system comprising:
means for executing the steps of the method of any of claims 1 to 10.
