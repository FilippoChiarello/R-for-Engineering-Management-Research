CLASSIFYING LIQUID HANDLING PROCEDURES WITH A NEURAL NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
A method for classifying liquid handling procedures comprises, such as pipetting procedures occurring during laboratory automated analyses: receiving measurement data (56) encoding a measurement curve (28, 30, 32) of measurements over time during at least a part of a liquid handling procedure; inputting the measurement data (56) into a neural network (57); and calculating at least one quality value (74, 86) for the liquid handling procedure with the neural network (57). The neural network allows to classify whether a liquid handling procedure is normal or abnormal, e.g. clotting in the line, presence of air or bubbles, etc...

<claims>
1. A method for classifying liquid handling procedures, the method
comprising:
receiving measurement data (56) encoding a measurement curve (28, 30,
32) of measurements over time during a liquid handling procedure;
inputting the measurement data (56) into a neural network (57);
inputting liquid handling data (54) into the neural network (57), wherein the liquid handling data (54) encode a configuration and/or setting of a laboratory automation system (10) performing the liquid handling procedure;
calculating at least one quality value (74, 86) for the liquid handling procedure with the neural network (57);
wherein the neural network (57) comprises at least one measurement data branch (76) composed of at least one layer and a liquid handling data branch (78) composed of at least one layer;
wherein the measurement data (56) is input into an input layer (58) of the measurement data branch (76) and the liquid handling data (54) is input into an input layer (82) of the liquid handling data branch (78).
2. The method of claim 1,
wherein the measurement data (56) comprise a vector (52) of timely ordered measurement values (57).
3. The method of claim 1 or 2,
wherein the measurement data branch (76) comprises at least two convolutional layers (62).
SY 4. The method of one of the previous claims,
wherein the neural network (57) comprises a dense layer branch (80) into which an output of the measurement data branch (76) and an output of the liquid handling data branch (78) is input.
5. The method of claim 4,
wherein the dense layer branch (80) comprises at least two dense layers
(70).
6. The method of one of the previous claims,
wherein the neural network (57) outputs a classification value (74), classifying the liquid handling procedure.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the classification value (74) indicates at least one of: correct procedure, clot, air aspiration, short sample, bubbles, foam, blocked tip, leakage.
8. The method of one of the previous claims,
wherein the neural network (57) outputs an estimation value (86), estimating a physical quantity of the liquid handling procedure.
9. The method of claim 8,
wherein the estimation value (86) estimates at least one of: a dispensed volume, an aspirated volume.
SY
10. The method of one of the previous claims,
wherein the liquid handling procedure comprises at least one of:
aspirating (30) the liquid (18) into a pipette (14) by lowering a pressure in the pipette (14);
dispensing (32) a liquid (18) in the pipette (14) and/or a dispense cannula by raising a pressure in the pipette (14) and/or the dispense cannula.
11. A computer program for classifying liquid handling procedures, which, when being executed by a processor, is adapted to carry out the steps of the method of one of the previous claims.
12. A computer-readable medium, in which a computer program according to claim 11 is stored.
13. A laboratory automation system (10), the system comprising:
a liquid handling arm (12) for carrying a pipette (14) and/or a dispense cannula;
a pump (20) for changing a pressure in a volume (22) connected to the pipette (14) for aspiring and dispensing a liquid (18) in the pipette (14);
a sensor device (24) for performing measurements in the volume (22) connected to the pipette (14);
a control device (26) for controlling the pump (20) and for receiving measurement data (56) from the sensor device (24);
wherein the control device (26) is adapted for performing the method of one of claims 1 to 11.
