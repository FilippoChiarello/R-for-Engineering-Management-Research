METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING PHYSICAL DOWNLINK SHARED CHANNEL IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND DEVICE SUPPORTING THE SAME
</title>

<abstract>
A method of receiving, by a user equipment, a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) in a wireless communication system. The method includes receiving, from a base station (BS), a higher layer signal including first information for an uplink (UL)-downlink (DL) configuration; repeatedly receiving, from the BS, a first transport block (TB) via the PDSCH based on the first information for the UL-DL configuration; receiving, from the BS, a first control channel including second information for the UL-DL configuration; and discarding a second control channel based on: (i) the second control channel scheduling a PDSCH repetition of a second TB in a transmission time unit, (ii) the first information for the UL-DL configuration indicating the transmission time unit as an uplink, and (iii) the second information for the UL-DL configuration indicating the transmission time unit as a downlink.

<claims>
1. A method of receiving, by a user equipment, a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) in a wireless communication system, the method comprising: receiving, from a base station (BS), configuration information related to an uplink (UL)-downlink (DL) configuration; repeatedly receiving, from the BS, a first PDSCH based on the configuration information; receiving, from the BS, a first physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) related to an UL-DL reconfiguration; and discarding a second PDCCH scheduling a repetition of a second PDSCH in a transmission time unit based on (i) the configuration information indicating the transmission time unit as an uplink, and (ii) the first PDCCH indicating the transmission time unit as a downlink.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the transmission time unit is a subframe or a special subframe.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the configuration information further comprises information for configuration of an enhanced interference mitigation and traffic adaptation (eIMTA) operation.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the first PDCCH is a PDCCH with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) scrambled by an eIMTA-radio network temporary identifier (RNTI).
5. A user equipment (UE) configured to receive a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) in a wireless communication system, the UE comprising: at least one transceiver; at least one processor; and at least one computer memory operably connectable to the at least one processor and storing instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, perform operations comprising: receiving, from a base station (BS), configuration information related to an uplink (UL)-downlink (DL) configuration; repeatedly receiving, from the BS, a first PDSCH based on the configuration information; receiving, from the BS, a first physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) related to an UL-DL reconfiguration; and discarding a second PDCCH scheduling a repetition of a second PDSCH in a transmission time unit based on (i) the configuration information indicating the transmission time unit as an uplink, and (ii) the first PDCCH indicating the transmission time unit as a downlink.
6. The UE of claim 5, wherein the transmission time unit is a subframe or a special subframe.
7. The UE of claim 5, wherein the configuration information further comprises information for configuration of an enhanced interference mitigation and traffic adaptation (eIMTA) operation.
8. The UE of claim 5, wherein the first PDCCH is a PDCCH with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) scrambled by an eIMTA-radio network temporary identifier (RNTI).
9. Abase station (BS) configured to transmit a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) in a wireless communication system, the BS comprising: at least one transceiver; at least one processor; and at least one computer memory operably connectable to the at least one processor and storing instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, perform operations comprising: transmitting, to a user equipment (UE), a configuration information related to an uplink (UL)-downlink (DL) configuration; repeatedly transmitting, to the UE, a first PDSCH based on the configuration information; and transmitting, to the UE, a first physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) related to an UL-DL reconfiguration, wherein a second PDCCH scheduling a repetition of a second PDSCH is discarded in a transmission time unit based on (i) the configuration information indicating the transmission time unit as an uplink, and (ii) the first PDCCH indicating the transmission time unit as a downlink.
10. The BS of claim 9, wherein the transmission time unit is a subframe or a special subframe.
11. The BS of claim 9, wherein the configuration information further comprises information for configuration of an enhanced interference mitigation and traffic adaptation (eIMTA) operation.
12. The BS of claim 9, wherein the first PDCCH is a PDCCH with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) scrambled by an eIMTA-radio network temporary identifier (RNTI).
