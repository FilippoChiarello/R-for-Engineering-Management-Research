MAP AND METHOD FOR CREATING A MAP
</title>

<abstract>
A method comprises capturing at least two images with an image unit, wherein each of the at least two images is captured from a different position of the image unit, wherein a first section of the surroundings of the image unit is captured by each of the at least two images, and wherein a section of an elongated landmark is captured in the first section, and generating at least two observation planes, wherein each observation plane is essentially orthogonal to the elongated landmark and crosses the elongated landmark at a certain point
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising:
capturing at least two images with an image unit, wherein each of the at least two images is captured from a different position of the image unit, wherein a first section of the surroundings of the image unit is captured by each of the at least two images, and wherein a section of an elongated landmark is captured in the first section;
generating at least two observation planes, wherein each observation plane is essentially orthogonal to the elongated landmark and crosses the elongated landmark at a certain point.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the image unit is a monocular camera.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the image unit is mounted on a vehicle.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the vehicle passes each of the at least two observation planes while moving along.
5. The method of claim 3 or 4, wherein the vehicle moves along a road, and wherein each of the at least two observation planes is arranged vertical to and across the road.
6. The method of any of claims 1 to 5, wherein a segment of the elongated landmark is the projection of a line segment in the 3D world that lies within a wedge.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the wedge is formed by a plane between two rays extending between the image unit and the edges of the corresponding image.
8. The method of any of claims 6 and 7, wherein the orientation of the segment of the elongated landmark is determined by the generation of the at least two observation planes.
9. The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein each of the at least two observation planes crosses the elongated landmark at a certain point which is visible in each of the at least two images.
10. A method for generating a map, the method comprising:
generating a local map in response to a triggering event;
uploading the local map to a central server;
ingesting the local map into the central server and linking the local map with at least one additional information; and
incorporating the local map into a global map stored on the central server, thereby creating an updated global map.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the at least one additional information includes at least one of a region where the local map was generated, and a time when the local map was generated.
12. The method of claim 10 or 11, wherein the local map is generated by a vehicle system.
13. The method of any of claim 12, further comprising
providing the updated global map to the vehicle system.
14. The method of claim 13, further comprising replacing a global map stored within the vehicle system with the updated global map.
15. The method of any of claims 10 to 14, wherein the local map comprises information obtained from a monocular image.
16. The method of any of claims 10 to 15, wherein the global map is created by fusing a plurality of uploaded local map fragments.
17. The method of any of claims 10 to 16, wherein the triggering event comprises at least one of reaching the end of a trip, the amount of data in a local map exceeding a specified limit, and operator override for earliest possible upload.
18. The method of any of claims 10 to 17, wherein the local map is generated as a hybrid map including point landmarks and semantic landmarks.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the hybrid map is generated combining characteristics of a dense map and characteristics of a sparse map.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein the characteristics of a dense map comprise 3D point clouds reconstructed from salient visual features, and wherein the characteristics of a sparse map comprise geometric representations of semantic features representing real world objects.
