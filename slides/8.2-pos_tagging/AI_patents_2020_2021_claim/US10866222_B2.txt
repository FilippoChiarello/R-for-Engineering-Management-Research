<title>
Chromatograph mass spectrometric data processing method and processing device
</title>

<abstract>
A compound-weight time-series data calculator creates a compound spectrum matrix based on standard mass spectra of various compounds stored in a standard mass spectrum library. Then, the calculator determines, in the form of a linear regression model, the relationship of the matrix, a measured vector based on the data acquired at one measurement time point, and a compound weight vector at the measurement time point, and estimates the unknown weight vector by a minimum norm estimation in which a regularizer is introduced. A compound-weight time-series graph creator creates a compound-weight time-series graph showing a temporal change in weight for each target compound, based on the compound weight vector obtained at the measurement time points within a specified time range. A peak which appears on this graph is used for the quantitative determination of the compound or determination on the presence or absence of the compound.
