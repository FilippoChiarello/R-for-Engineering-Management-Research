<title>
Interactive Displays
</title>

<abstract>
A method of controlling an interactive display comprises receiving position data over time, where the position data represents the position of an input object relative to the interactive display. A velocity and acceleration of the input object are estimated, and a future position of the input object is predicted based on the estimated velocity and acceleration. This predicted future position is used to update the display.

<claims>
1. A method of controlling an interactive display, the method comprising: receiving position data representing a series of positions, over time, of an input object relative to the interactive display; predicting a first future position of the input object based on a first set of the position data; updating the display with a first display update based on the first predicted future position; subsequently receiving a second set of the position data, wherein the second set of the position data indicates that the first predicted future position is an incorrect prediction; retaining the first display update on the interactive display; predicting a second future position of the input object based on the second set of the position data; and updating the display with a second display update based on the second predicted future position.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the interactive display is an electrophoretic display.
3. An apparatus comprising: an interactive display; a position sensor for generating position data representing a series of positions, over time, of an input object relative to the interactive display; and a processing system configured to: predict a first future position of the input object based on a first set of the position data; update the display with a first display update based on the first predicted future position; subsequently receive a second set of position data wherein the second set of the position data indicates that the first predicted future position is an incorrect prediction; retain the first display update on the interactive display; predict a second future position of the input object based on the second set of the position data; and update the display with a second display update based on the second predicted future position.
4. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the interactive display is an electrophoretic display.
5. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the apparatus is a tablet device.
6. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the interactive display is configured to display one or more line segments representing predicted positions of the input object over time.
7. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the processing system is configured to update the display by extending a line segment of the one or more line segments with an extension segment.
8. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the processing system is configured to predict the first future position and/or the second future position using one or more of: double-exponential smoothing, Gaussian process regression, a neural network, multilayer perceptrons, random forest, and/or support-vector regression.
9. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the processing system is configured to predict the first future position and/or the second future position by inputting the position data to each of a plurality of algorithms, each algorithm outputting a respective position estimate, and by processing the position estimates output by the plurality of algorithms to predict the first future position and/or the second future position.
10. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the processing system is configured to predict a set of one or more future positions, based on the position data, in an update cycle, wherein the number of future positions that are predicted in each update of the update cycle is variable.
11. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the processing system is configured to calculate, each update, how many future positions to predict, based on the position data.
12. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the processing system is configured to calculate a confidence measure for each of the set of one or more predicted future positions.
13. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the processing system is configured to apply a validation process to the set of one or more predicted future positions, to assess the future positions against one or more validation criteria, and, if validation fails for an update cycle, to predict a reduced number of future positions for that update cycle.
14. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the processing system is configured to apply a smoothing operation to the position data and the first predicted future position to generate smoothed data, and then to update the display based on the smoothed data.
15. The apparatus of claim 14, wherein the processing system is configured to further apply the smoothing operation to the position data, the first predicted future position and the second future position to generate further smoothed data, and then to update the display based on the further smoothed data.
16. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the processing system is configured to use further data from one or more further sensors when determining the first future position and/or the second future position.
17. The apparatus of claim 16, wherein the processing system is configured to use data from a pressure or force sensor in the input object or the interactive display to determine the first future position and/or the second future position.
18. The apparatus of claim 16, wherein the further data represents a position, motion, momentum, a state of the input object, an acceleration or rotation or orientation of the input object.
19. The apparatus of claim 16, comprising one or more sensors for generating the further data, selected from the group consisting of: an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a compass, a pressure sensor, an electromagnetic coil, an antenna, an RF transmitter, an RF receiver, and/or a light sensor.
20. The apparatus of claim 16, wherein the input object or the interactive display comprises a pressure sensor, wherein the further data comprises pressure data generated from the pressure sensor, and wherein the processing system is configured to generate, in successive update cycles, successive sequences of future position estimates over time, and is configured to generate a first sequence of future position estimates of a first duration when the pressure data represents a first pressure, and to generate a second sequence of future position estimates of a second duration, shorter than the first duration, when the pressure data represents a second pressure that is lighter than the first pressure.
