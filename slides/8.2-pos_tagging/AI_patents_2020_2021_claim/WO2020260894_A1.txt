<claims>
1 . A method for processing digital works, the method comprising the steps of:
identifying terms within each digital work of a plurality of digital works, wherein the terms are words and/or phrases;
determining a number of times that the identified terms occur within each digital work of the plurality of digital works;
generating a fingerprint for each digital work of the plurality of digital works, the generated fingerprint based on the identified terms and the number of times that the identified terms occur within each digital work;
using a neural network to find an encoding function, g, that encodes a higher dimensionality space, x, of each fingerprint into a lower dimensionality space, y
applying the encoding function to each fingerprint of the plurality of digital works to reduce their dimensionality; and
determining a similarity between a first fingerprint and one or more dimensionality reduced fingerprints.
2. The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of generating an output of data indicating digital works having fingerprints with a similarity to the first dimensionality reduced fingerprint exceeding a threshold.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the output is generated in response to receiving a query.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the query includes one or more terms and the first fingerprint is formed from the query.
5. The method of claim 4 further comprising the step of receiving from a user the query formed from a selection of the one or more terms.
6. The method according to claim 4 or claim 5 further comprising the step of applying the encoding function to the first fingerprint of to reduce its dimensionality before determining the similarity between the first fingerprint and one or more dimensionality reduced fingerprints. 7. The method according to any previous claim, wherein the similarity is based on a co-occurrence of terms within the dimensionally reduced fingerprints.
8. The method according to any previous claim further comprising the steps:
of receiving a new digital work; and
adding the new digital work to the plurality of digital works.
9. The method according to any previous claim, wherein the encoding function, g, is found according to the function:
g x® y
by estimating an original higher dimensionality space, X, by inverting the function, g, according to:
g . y ® X.
9. The method according to any previous claim further comprising the step of storing the plurality fingerprints and data identifying associated digital works in a repository.
10. The method according to any previous claim, wherein the similarity between two or more dimensionality reduced fingerprints is determined based on a scoring function.
1 1. The method of claim 10, wherein the scoring function, sim(.), is:
V º j
where f1 and f2 are dimensionality reduced fingerprints to compare and / and j are terms within the dimensionality reduced fingerprints.
12. The method of claim 1 1 , wherein an expectation of a score between the two terms, / and _/ is evaluated according to:
13. The method of claim 1 1 or claim 12 further comprising the step of sorting fingerprints recommendations by their respective similarity values, computed by the scoring function.
14. The method according to any previous claim, wherein identifying terms within each digital work further comprises identifying terms based on a look up table or a dictionary or by tagging terms previous identified in previous processing.
15. The method according to any previous claim further comprising the step of limiting the number of identified terms in each digital work.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the limited number of identified terms is a predetermined limit.
17. The method according to any previous claim, wherein the digital works are any one or more of: text, documents, web pages, articles, news stories, books, newspaper content, social media content, and/or publications.
18. A data processing apparatus comprising a processor adapted to perform the steps of the method of claims 1 to 17.
19. A computer program comprising instructions, which when executed by a computer, cause the computer to carry out the method of claims 1 to 17.
20. A computer-readable medium comprising instructions, which when executed by a computer, cause the computer to carry out the method of claims 1 to 17.
