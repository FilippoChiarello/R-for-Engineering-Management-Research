<abstract>
In one embodiment, a computing system determines quality of experience metrics and root-cause metrics for geographic areas connected by a communication network based on application data. The system determines that one or more of the geographic areas have low quality of experience based on the quality of experience metrics and a first set of criteria which includes one or more first thresholds for the quality of experience metrics. The system determines causes for the low quality of experience in each associated geographic area having low quality of experience based on the root-cause metrics and a second set of criteria which includes one or more second thresholds and is looser than the first set of criteria. The system determines a solution recommendation for the low quality of experience in each associated geographic area based on the causes of the low quality of experience of that geographic area.

The method of claim 1, wherein determining that the one or more of the geographic areas have low quality of experience comprises: determining a percentile value for each quality of experience metric of each geographic area of the plurality of geographic areas; and filtering the percentile values of the quality of experience metrics of the plurality of geographic areas using the one or more first thresholds, wherein the one or more of the geographic areas are determined to have low quality of experience when each of these geographic areas has at least one quality of experience metric percentile value being above the one or more first thresholds.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the one or more causes for each geographic area with low quality of experience comprise: determining a percentile value for each root-cause metric of each geographic area having low quality of experience; and filtering the percentile values of the root-cause metrics of the one or more geographic areas having low quality of experience using the one or more second thresholds, wherein the one or more of causes are determined when their corresponding root-cause metric percentile values is above the one or more second thresholds.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining a quality of experience score based on the one or more quality of experience metrics and a mapping function, wherein one or more of the plurality of geographic areas have low quality of experience are determined based on the quality of experience score and a third threshold.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: generating a report comprising the one or more of the geographic areas having the low quality of experience and the one or more causes for the low quality of experience in respective geographic areas.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein the connection demand metric comprises one or more of: a number of samples; a number of connected devices; a number of connected users; an amount of transmitted data; a network traffic metric; or a revenue metric.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more causes for the low quality of experience in an associated geographic area comprise a signal strength, wherein the solution recommendation for that associated geographic areas comprises one or more recommendation actions comprising one or more of: increasing cell transmitting power; reducing interference; adding repeaters; adding new cells; or tuning cell antenna.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more causes for the low quality of experience in an associated geographic area comprise a congestion indicator, wherein the solution recommendation for that associated geographic areas comprises one or more recommendation actions comprising one or more of: upgrading network; network densification; network traffic offloading; or network load balancing.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more quality of experience metrics and the one or more root-cause metrics comprise one or more of: a download speed; a download speed of busy hours; a network latency at all hours; a network latency at busy hours; a downstream latency; an upstream latency; a video quality score; a quality of experience score; a packet loss metric; a signal strength; a congestion indicator; a network latency; or a number of samples.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more first thresholds for the one or more quality of experience metrics and the one or more second thresholds for the one or more root-cause metrics are determined by a machine learning model.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more geographic areas having low quality of experience and the one or more causes for the low quality experience in each associated geographic areas are determined by a machine learning model.
12. One or more computer-readable non-transitory storage media embodying software that is operable when executed to: determine, for one or more geographic areas connected by a communication network, one or more quality of experience metrics and one or more root-cause metrics based on application data collected from the one or more geographic areas; determine that one or more of the geographic areas have low quality of experience based on the one or more quality of experience metrics and a first set of criteria, wherein the first set of criteria comprises one or more first thresholds for the one or more quality of experience metrics; determine one or more causes for the low quality of experience in each associated geographic area based on the one or more root-cause metrics and a second set of criteria, wherein the second set of criteria comprises one or more second thresholds for the one or more root-cause metrics, and wherein the second set of criteria is looser than the first set of criteria; determine a priority score for each geographic area having low quality of experiences based on a connection demand metric associated with that geographic areas; and determine a solution recommendation for the low quality of experience of each associated geographic area based on the one or more causes of the low quality of experience of that geographic area, wherein the solution recommendation for that geographic area is determined based on the priority score.
