A METHOD FOR MOTION ARTIFACT DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to a medical imaging method for motion artifact detection. The method comprises: using (201-203) a k-space acquisition property for generating a motion-corrupted image having a motion artifact as caused by a first initial motion pattern such that the motion artifact is defined as function of a feature matrix and the motion-corrupted image; initializing (205) at least one feature map of a convolutional neural network, CNN, with values of the convolution matrix; training (207) the initialized CNN to obtain, in training images, motion artifacts caused by a second training motion pattern; obtaining (209) a motion artifact in an input image using the trained CNN.
