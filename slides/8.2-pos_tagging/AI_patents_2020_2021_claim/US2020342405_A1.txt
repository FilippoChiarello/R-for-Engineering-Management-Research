<title>
Agile human resources method within the geoscience informatics field
</title>

<abstract>
Described within is an agile human resources (HR), or agile HR, method for modeling agile development team structure within the geoscience informatics or geoscience information systems (GIS) field of study. As agile adoption continues to span outside the traditional sphere of agile software development, to cover an evolving set of cross-functional informatics and quantitative specialties, there is a need for a defined agile human resources process. The steps to this process include: receiving requirements for an agile technology project from one or more customers; identifying any project stakeholders; identifying said project is primarily within a geoscience informatics field of study; identifying that an agile development team is to be modeled; identifying at least one agile development methodology to utilize in modeling; generating a team structure model document; reviewing with any project stakeholders and talent acquisition providers; and managing any agile team structure changes.

<claims>
1. A method of agile human resources management to model candidate team structure comprising of: receiving requirements for an agile technology project from one or more customers; identifying any project stakeholders; identifying said project is primarily within a geoscience informatics field of study; identifying that an agile development team is to be modeled; identifying at least one agile development methodology to utilize in modeling; generating a team structure model document; reviewing with any project stakeholders; collaborating with talent acquisition providers; and managing any agile team structure changes throughout the implementation of the project.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising of: receiving approved agile or hybrid-agile development project requirements; comprising of at least one of a software, firmware, hardware, digital, or quantitative technology products.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising of: identifying one or more agile executives; wherein an approved project may be comprised of multiple agile teams working on similarly related products under the directive of one or more agile executive leaders; referred forward as agile executive leaders.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising of: identifying one or more agile leadership team members; referred forward as agile development leaders.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising of: wherein a development project is primarily a geoscience informatics or a geoscience information systems project, a field of study covering environment, earth, ecology, pollution, sustainability related concerns in informatics; which may contain one or more products.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising of: identifying that an agile development team is to be structured for said development project.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising of: identifying at least one agile methodology to utilize in modeling team structure for said development project.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising of: modeling from agile team modeling principles wherein typical agile team models comprise of 4 to 10 team members which may include a coach, a product owner, a user experience designer, a quality tester, two or more of software engineers or quantitative data scientists, and any candidate specialists needed based on the requirements of said development project.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising of: receiving from at least one customer, agile executive leader or agile development leader, any available data identifying: one or more scientific, engineering, or specialist candidates that would be utilized; at what stage or iteration of development said candidates would be utilized; an anticipated number of agile team members needed; any existing employees or contractors that could be used; any re-training that could be done; any new candidate hiring that is expected; any consultant hiring that is expected; geographic work locations; timeline data; licenses and certification requirements; access authorization or security clearance requirements; USCIS immigration constraints; salary or fees budgetary constraints; and any inclusive candidate demographics desired.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising of: using a computer and software to input said data into a software document.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising of: generating the first itineration of a team structure model document.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising of: communicating with said project stakeholders; customers; agile executive leaders; agile development leaders to review said team structure model document, and making any modifications found necessary.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising of: implementing said agile team structure model by advising with said talent acquisition providers to communicate the team structure model document; relaying any gathered information for the writing of job descriptions, talent sourcing, interviewing, and hiring of talent; reviewing any pre-vetted candidates from the talent acquisition providers; reviewing candidates with one or more project stakeholders, customers, agile executive leaders or agile development leaders; facilitating agile interviews, facilitating hiring, and making appropriate changes to the team structure model document as needed.
14. The method of claim 13, further comprising of: managing any changes to the agile team structure as work progresses through the iterations.
