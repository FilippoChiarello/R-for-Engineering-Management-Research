INFORMATION OUTPUT SYSTEM, INFORMATION OUTPUT METHOD, AND RECORDING MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
An information output system for leading a person in such a way as to rapidly achieve a predetermined state for investigation of crime using communication means is provided. An information output system 200 includes an identification unit 220, a storage unit 230, and an output unit 250. The identification unit 220 identifies an observed state, based on information indicating a message from a person. The storage unit 230 stores knowledge information to be used for reasoning of a target state being a predetermined state for investigation. The output unit 250 performs reasoning, based on observation information indicating the observed state and the knowledge information, and outputs information indicating a message to be spoken or sent by the person.

<claims>
1. An information output system comprising: a memory storing instructions; and one or more processors configured to execute the instructions to: identify an observed state, based on information indicating a message from a person; store knowledge information to be used for reasoning of a target state being a predetermined state for investigation; and perform reasoning, based on observation information indicating the observed state and the knowledge information, and output information indicating a message to be spoken or sent by the person.
2. The information output system according to claim 1, wherein the one or more processors is further configured to execute the instructions to: generate new knowledge, based on the knowledge information, and perform reasoning, based on the observation information, the knowledge information, and the new knowledge.
3. The information output system according to claim 1, wherein the one or more processors is further configured to execute the instructions to: acquire a knowledge series being reachable to the target state by the reasoning, and determine a message to be spoken or sent by the person, based on a state related to knowledge acquired in order from the knowledge series.
4. The information output system according to claim 3, wherein the one or more processors is further configured to execute the instructions to: determine, every time the observed state is identified, whether the observed state is identical to the state related to knowledge acquired in order from the knowledge series, and determine, when the observed state is identical to the state and a next state following the observed state is a state related to a message from the person, a message corresponding to the next state as a message to be spoken or sent by the person.
5. The information output system according to claim 3, wherein the one or more processors is further configured to execute the instructions to: when the observed state is different from the state related to knowledge acquired in order from the knowledge series, determine whether the observed state is identical to a state related to knowledge acquired in order from another knowledge series associated with the state.
6. The information output system according to claim 1, wherein the target state is a state where information needed to start the investigation is acquired.
7. The information output system according to claim 6, wherein the one or more processors is further configured to execute the instructions to: store another piece of knowledge information needed for reasoning of another target state being a state where crime to be investigated occurs, and perform reasoning of the target state when occurrence of the crime to be investigated is detected by performing reasoning based on the observation information and the another piece of knowledge information.
8. An information output method comprising: identifying an observed state, based on information indicating a message from a person; storing knowledge information to be used for reasoning of a target state being a predetermined state for investigation; and performing reasoning, based on observation information indicating the observed state and the knowledge information, and outputting information indicating a message to be spoken or sent by the person.
9. A non-transitory computer readable storage medium recording thereon a program causing a computer to perform a method comprising: identifying an observed state, based on information indicating a message from a person; storing knowledge information to be used for reasoning of a target state being a predetermined state for investigation; and performing reasoning, based on observation information indicating the observed state and the knowledge information, and outputting information indicating a message to be spoken or sent by the person.
