<abstract>
One embodiment provides an electronic control unit (ECU) for a vehicle. The ECU includes transceiver circuitry, voltage measurement circuitry and feature set circuitry. The transceiver circuitry is to at least one of send and/or receive a message. The voltage measurement circuitry is to determine at least one of a high bus line voltage (VCANH) value and/or a low bus line voltage (VCANL) value, for each zero bit of at least one zero bit of a received message. The received the message includes a plurality of bits. The feature set circuitry is to determine a value of at least one feature of a feature set based, at least in part, on at least one of a high acknowledge (ACK) threshold voltage (VthH) and/or a low ACK threshold voltage (VthL). The feature set includes at least one of an operating most frequently measured VCANH value (VfreqH2) of a number of VCANH values and/or an operating most frequently measured VCANL value (VfreqL2) of a number of VCANL values.
