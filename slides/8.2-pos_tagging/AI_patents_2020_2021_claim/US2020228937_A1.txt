Method and System to Extend Connection Time Of A Talkgroup Conversation Based On Historical Talkgroup Statistics
</title>

<abstract>
A method for extending the connection time of talkgroup radios in a talkgroup conversation based on historical talkgroup statistics is provided. A talkgroup conversation request intended for a talkgroup is received from a first mobile unit. A group call grant message is sent to radios that are members of the talkgroup. The group call grant message initiates the talkgroup conversation with a first talkgroup call and includes an extended connection time value. Once it is determined that the first talkgroup call has ended, all radios that are members of the talkgroup are kept in a connected state. An extended connection timer utilizing the extended connection time value is started. Upon expiration of the extended connection timer, all radios that are members of the talkgroup are set to an idle state.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method comprising: receiving a talkgroup conversation request intended for a talkgroup from a first mobile unit; sending a group call grant message to radios that are members of the talkgroup, the group call grant message initiating the talkgroup conversation with a first talkgroup call and including an extended connection time value; determining that the first talkgroup call has ended; keeping all radios that are members of the talkgroup in a connected state; starting an extended connection timer utilizing the extended connection time value; and upon expiration of the extended connection timer, each of the radios that are members of the talkgroup transition to an idle state.
2. The method of claim 1, the method further comprising the step of starting a second talkgroup call in the talkgroup conversation without paging the radios that are members of the talkgroup.
3. The method of claim 2, the method further comprising the step of cancelling the extended connection timer.
4. The method of claim 1, the method further comprising the step of starting the extended connection timer using an adjusted extended connection time value.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the adjusted extended connection time value comprises the extended connection time value minus an elapsed time of the talkgroup conversation.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein the adjusted extended connection time value comprises the extended connection time value adjusted by at least one of additional radios joining the talkgroup, radios leaving the talkgroup, a priority of one of the radios that are members of the talkgroup, and a changed role of one of the radios that are members of the talkgroup.
7. The method of claim 1, the method further comprising the step of starting a second talkgroup call in the talkgroup conversation without performing audio holdoff.
8. The method of claim 1, the method further comprising the step of starting a second talkgroup call in the talkgroup conversation, wherein the second talkgroup call is started immediately.
9. A method comprising: setting an extended connection time value for a talkgroup to a default value; determining a closeness attribute for the talkgroup; and utilizing the closeness attribute to update the extended connection time value.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the step of determining the closeness attribute comprises utilizing machine learning.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the closeness attribute includes a number of users in the talkgroup, and wherein the step of determining a closeness attribute comprises determining that there have been changes in the number of users in the talkgroup.
12. The method of claim 9, wherein the closeness attribute includes users that comprise user roles, and wherein the step of determining a closeness attribute comprises determining that there have been changes in the user roles.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein the closeness attribute includes an incident type, and wherein the step of determining a closeness attribute comprises determining that there has been a change in the incident type.
14. The method of claim 9, wherein the closeness attribute represents the closeness of talkgroup calls within a talkgroup conversation for a cluster.
15. The method of claim 9, the method further comprising the step of keeping all radios that are members of the talkgroup in a connected state.
16. The method of claim 9, wherein the step of determining a closeness attribute for the talkgroup comprises continuously analyzing the traffic pattern of the talkgroup.
17. The method of claim 9, wherein the step of determining a closeness attribute for the talkgroup comprises using statistically-learned behavior of the talkgroup to determine the closeness attribute for the talkgroup.
18. The method of claim 9, wherein the step of determining a closeness attribute for the talkgroup comprises determining the closeness attribute using at least one of additional radios joining the talkgroup, radios leaving the talkgroup, a priority of one radio that is a member of the talkgroup, a changed role of one of the radios that are members of the talkgroup and time of day.
19. A Push To Talk (PTT) Server comprising: a communication interface that performs: receiving a talkgroup conversation request intended for a talkgroup from a first mobile unit; and sending a group call grant message to radios that are members of the talkgroup, the group call grant message initiating the talkgroup conversation with a first talkgroup call and including an extended connection time value; and a processor that performs: determining that the first talkgroup call has ended; keeping all radios that are members of the talkgroup in a connected state; starting an extended connection timer utilizing the extended connection time value; and upon expiration of the extended connection timer, each of the radios that are members of the talkgroup transition to an idle state.
