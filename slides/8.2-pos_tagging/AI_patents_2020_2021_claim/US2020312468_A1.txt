OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT APPARATUS, OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An operations management apparatus includes: a memory; and a processor coupled to the memory, the processor being configured to execute an acquiring processing that includes acquiring operations management information in communications with one or more devices, execute a monitoring processing that includes monitoring conditions of the one or more devices by transmitting or receiving a condition monitoring packet to or from the one or more devices, execute a judging processing that includes judging whether the operations management information has been worsened at the time of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet, and execute a determining processing that includes determining a method of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet depending on a result of judgment made by the judging processing.

<claims>
1. An operations management apparatus comprising: a memory; and a processor coupled to the memory, the processor being configured to execute an acquiring processing that includes acquiring operations management information in communications with one or more devices, execute a monitoring processing that includes monitoring conditions of the one or more devices by transmitting or receiving a condition monitoring packet to or from the one or more devices, execute a judging processing that includes judging whether the operations management information has been worsened at the time of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet, and execute a determining processing that includes determining a method of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet depending on a result of judgment made by the judging processing.
2. The operations management apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the determining processing is configured to select an unused protocol from among a plurality of protocols set in the one or more devices for transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet.
3. The operations management apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the determining processing is configured to change a transmission timing or a transmission interval for transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet.
4. The operations management apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the judging processing is configured to judge whether the operations management information has been worsened in an unused protocol among a plurality of protocols set in the one or more devices at the time of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet, and when the operations management information is judged to have been worsened in the unused protocol, the monitoring processing is configured to stop the transmission or reception of the condition monitoring packet of the one or more devices.
5. The operations management apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the operations management information includes operations management information indicating communication quality of the one or more devices, the judging processing is configured to judge whether the operations management information indicating the communication quality has been worsened at the time of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet, and the determining processing is configured to determine the method of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet depending on a result of judgment made by the judging unit on the operations management information indicating the communication quality.
6. The operations management apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the operations management information includes operations management information indicating terminal quality of each of the one or more devices, the judging processing is configured to judge whether the operations management information indicating the terminal quality has been worsened at the time of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet, and the determining processing is configured to determine the method of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet, for each of the one or more devices, depending on a result of judgment made by the judging processing on the operations management information indicating the terminal quality.
7. The operations management apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the one or more devices include a plurality of sensor nodes and one or more relays that relay and transmit measured values of the plurality of sensor nodes to the operations management apparatus, the judging processing is configured to judge whether the operations management information has been worsened at the time of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet for each relay and for each protocol for transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet, and the determining processing is configured to determine the method of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet depending on a result of judgment made by the judging processing.
8. The operations management apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the determining processing is configured to hold in advance presence or absence of an effect of improving terminal quality for each of the methods of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet, and determine the method that has the effect of improving the terminal quality.
9. The operations management apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the acquiring processing is configured to adjust an interval or timing of acquiring the operations management information depending on an interval or timing of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet.
10. An operations management system comprising: one or more devices; an operations management apparatus configured to communicate with the one or more devices, wherein the operations management apparatus includes: a memory; and a processor coupled to the memory, the processor being configured to execute an acquiring processing that includes acquiring operations management information in communications with the one or more devices; execute a monitoring processing that includes monitoring conditions of the one or more devices by transmitting or receiving a condition monitoring packet to or from the one or more devices; execute a judging processing that includes judging whether the operations management information has been worsened at the time of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet; and execute a determining processing that includes determining a method of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet depending on a result of judgment made by the judging processing.
11. An operations management method implemented by a computer, the operations management method comprising: executing an acquiring processing that includes acquiring operations management information in communications with one or more devices; executing a monitoring processing that includes monitoring conditions of the one or more devices by transmitting or receiving a condition monitoring packet to or from the one or more devices; executing a judging processing that includes judging whether the operations management information has been worsened at the time of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet; and executing a determining processing that includes determining a method of transmitting or receiving the condition monitoring packet depending on a result of judgment made by the judging processing.
