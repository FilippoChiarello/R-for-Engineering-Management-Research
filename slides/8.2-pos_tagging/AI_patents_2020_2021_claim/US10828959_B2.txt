Controlling in-vehicle air quality
</title>

<abstract>
A method to train a machine learning model for in-vehicle air quality control in a knowledge-based system, executed by one or more computer processors, includes collecting data related to in-vehicle air quality from a plurality of probe cars where the data is collected by various on-board systems in each probe car. The method includes correlating the data related to in-vehicle air quality from each probe car with air quality measurements from each probe car, where the correlation is used to update the machine learning model. The method includes determining a situation when an in-vehicle air quality measurement of the air quality measurements is above a pre-determined in-vehicle air quality level and determining instructions for actions by one or more of the one or more on-board systems in each of the probe cars to maintain an in-vehicle air quality level at or below the pre-determined in-vehicle air quality level.
