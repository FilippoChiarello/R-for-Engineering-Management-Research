SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR CROWDSOURCING DEVICE RECOGNITION
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the present invention provide techniques, systems, and methods for crowdsourcing device recognition to collect device information and identification data from a limited number of network devices and then leverage the collected information with machine learning techniques to expand the starting set in way that the prediction of device attributes like device type, device brand, family and model can be applied on billions of devices.

<claims>
1. A device recognition system comprising: a data collection module configured to collect device data associated with a device on a network; an identification data module configured to identify the device based at least in part on the device data to create an identification; and a cluster analysis module configured to predict, using machine learning ensembles, a set of device characteristics based at least in part on the identification, wherein the machine learning ensembles classify the device into a predicted group of devices having the set of device characteristics.
2. The device recognition system of claim 1, wherein the cluster analysis module is further configured to: determine a portion of a hardware address corresponding to the device; and utilize the portion of the hardware address in the machine learning ensembles to determine the set of device characteristics.
3. The device recognition system of claim 1, wherein the set of device characteristics include at least one of a device brand identifier and a device model identifier.
4. The device recognition system of claim 1, wherein the set of device characteristics include a manufacturing batch identifier.
5. The device recognition system of claim 1, wherein the machine learning ensembles utilize multiple decision trees to classify the device.
6. A method for device recognition, the method comprising: collecting device data associated with a device detected on a network; identifying the device based at least in part on the device data to create an identification; and predicting, using machine learning ensembles, a set of device characteristics based at least in part on the identification, wherein the machine learning ensembles classify the device into a predicted group of devices having the set of device characteristics.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the step of predicting includes the steps of: determining a portion of a hardware address corresponding to the device; and utilizing the portion of the hardware address in the machine learning ensembles to determine the set of device characteristics.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein a length of the portion of the hardware address is proportional to a size of the predicted group of devices having the set of device characteristics.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising the steps of generating a confidence score as a function of the portion of the hardware address and of the size of the predicted group of devices.
10. The method of claim 6, wherein the set of device characteristics include at least one of a device brand identifier and a device model identifier.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the set of device characteristics includes a manufacturing batch identifier.
12. The method of claim 6, wherein the machine learning ensembles utilize multiple decision trees to classify the device.
13. The method of claim 6, further comprising the step of providing targeted content to the device based on the set of device characteristics, wherein the device characteristics include a brand of the device and a model of the device.
14. A system comprising: a processor; and a non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions executable by the processor to: collect a plurality of device data associated with a set of devices detected on a network; determine a key based on an analysis of a portion of the plurality of device data; identify, based at least in part on the key, device specifications corresponding to the set of devices; determine a cluster of devices among the set of devices based at least in part on the device specifications; and output the cluster of devices and the key as entries in a data structure, wherein the key is used as an index to the data structure to determine the cluster of devices.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the plurality of device data includes a media access control (MAC) address of each device in the set of devices.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the key is a portion of a MAC address of a device in the set of devices.
17. The system of claim 14, wherein a length of the key is proportional to a size of the cluster of devices.
18. The system of claim 14, wherein the cluster of devices is determined after removal of a redundant cluster of devices of insufficient cluster size.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein the removal of a redundant cluster of devices of insufficient cluster size is based on a predetermined threshold.
20. The system of claim 14, wherein the device specifications are identified by utilizing the key in machine learning ensembles.
