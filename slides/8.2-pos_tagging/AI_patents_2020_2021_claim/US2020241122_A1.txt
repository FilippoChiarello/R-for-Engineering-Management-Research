RADAR SYSTEM WITH THREE-DIMENSIONAL BEAM SCANNING
</title>

<abstract>
Examples disclosed herein relate to a radar system for three-dimensional beam scanning that includes an antenna module that radiates radio frequency (RF) beams with an analog beamforming antenna in a plurality of directions using phase control elements and generates radar data capturing a surrounding environment from received RF return signals. The antenna module includes a first transceiver operational at a first frequency and configured to scan a field of view with first RF beams along a first axis, and a second transceiver operational at a second frequency and configured to scan the field of view with second RF beams along a second axis. The radar system also includes a perception module that detects and identifies a target in the surrounding environment from the radar data.

<claims>
1. A radar system for three-dimensional beam scanning, comprising: an antenna module configured to radiate one or more radio frequency (RF) beams with an analog beamforming antenna in a plurality of directions using one or more phase control elements and to generate radar data capturing a surrounding environment from one or more received RF return signals, wherein the antenna module comprises: a first transceiver operational at a first frequency and configured to scan a field of view with first RF beams along a first axis, and a second transceiver operational at a second frequency different from the first frequency and configured to scan the field of view with second RF beams along a second axis orthogonal to the first axis; and a perception module configured to detect and identify a target in the surrounding environment from the radar data.
2. The radar system of claim 1, wherein the first transceiver is further configured to scan the field of view along the first axis concurrently with the second transceiver scanning the field of view along the second axis.
3. The radar system of claim 1, wherein the first transceiver is further configured to scan a subject location in azimuth while the second transceiver scans the field-of-view in elevation at the subject location in azimuth.
4. The radar system of claim 3, wherein the first transceiver is further configured to steer the first RF beams to a subsequent location in azimuth when the second transceiver completes scanning the field-of-view in elevation at the subject location in azimuth.
5. The radar system of claim 1, wherein the antenna module is further configured to generate first radar data from the one or more received RF return signals in the first axis and second radar data from the one or more received RF return signals in the second axis.
6. The radar system of claim 5, wherein the perception module is further configured to: detect one or more objects from the first radar data and the second radar data; determine whether at least one of the detected one or more objects is a same object between the first radar data and the second radar data; and merge the first radar data with the second radar data to generate merged radar data when the at least one of the detected one or more objects is the same object.
7. The radar system of claim 6, wherein the perception module is further configured to identify the detected one or more objects individually between the first radar data and the second radar data when the at least one of the detected one or more objects is not the same object.
8. The radar system of claim 1, wherein the first axis corresponds to an azimuth direction and the second axis corresponds to an elevation direction.
9. The radar system of claim 1, wherein each of the first RF beams and the second RF beams comprises a frequency-modulated continuous waveform (FMCW) chirp signal.
