APPARATUS FOR PATIENT SEDATION MONITORING
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to an apparatus (10) for patient sedation monitoring. The apparatus comprises a plurality of patient stimulation devices (20), at least one sensor device (30), and a processing unit (40). Each patient stimulation device of the plurality of patient stimulation devices is configured to provide a mode of stimulation. The modes of stimulation for the plurality of patient stimulation devices are different to each other. The plurality of patient stimulation devices is configured to provide a multi-modal stimuli to a sedated patient. The at least one sensor device is configured to acquire at least one patient response to the multi-modal stimuli. The processing unit is configured to determine a sedation state of the sedated patient comprising utilization of the at least one patient response to the multi-modal stimuli.

<claims>
1. An apparatus (10) for patient sedation monitoring, comprising: - a plurality of patient stimulation devices (20); - at least one sensor device (30); and - a processing unit (40); wherein, each patient stimulation device of the plurality of patient stimulation devices is configured to provide a mode of stimulation, and wherein the modes of stimulation for the plurality of patient stimulation devices are different to each other;
wherein, the plurality of patient stimulation devices is configured to provide a multi-modal stimuli to a sedated patient;
wherein, the at least one sensor device is configured to acquire at least one patient response to the multi-modal stimuli; and
wherein, the processing unit is configured to determine a sedation state of the sedated patient comprising utilization of the at least one patient response to the multi-modal stimuli.
2. Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the plurality of patient stimulation devices are configured to operate in a frequency range of 0.1Hz to 10Hz.
3. Apparatus according to any of claims 1-2, wherein the plurality of patient stimulation devices are configured to provide the modes of stimulation simultaneously to provide the multi-modal stimuli to the sedated patient.
4. Apparatus according to any of claims 1-3, wherein the plurality of patient stimulation devices are configured to provide the modes of stimulation congruently to provide the multi-modal stimuli to the sedated patient.
5. Apparatus according to any of claims 1-4, wherein the plurality of patient stimulation devices are configured to provide stimuli targeted at a plurality of sensory organs of the sedated patient.
6. Apparatus according to claim 5, wherein a first patient stimulation device is configured to target a first sensory organ and a second patient stimulation device is configured to target a second sensory organ.
7. Apparatus according to any of claims 1-6, wherein the processing unit is configured to select the plurality of patient stimulation devices from a larger number of potential patient stimulation devices, the selection comprising utilization of sensory information relating to the sedated patient.
8. Apparatus according to any of claims 1-7, wherein the at least one patient response comprises a plurality of patient responses, wherein the plurality of patient response are different to each other.
9. An image acquisition system (100), comprising: - an image acquisition unit (110); and - an apparatus (10) for patient sedation monitoring according to any of claims 1-8; wherein, the image acquisition unit is configured to acquire image data of the sedated patient; and
wherein, the processing unit is configured to determine at least one scan protocol and/or terminate a scan protocol for the image acquisition unit for the acquisition of the image data comprising utilization of the determined sedation state of the patient.
10. A method (200) for patient sedation monitoring, comprising: b) providing (210) by a plurality of patient stimulation devices a multi-modal stimuli to a sedated patient, wherein each patient stimulation device of the plurality of patient stimulation devices is configured to provide a mode of stimulation, and wherein the modes of stimulation for the plurality of patient stimulation devices are different to each other c) acquiring (220) by at least one sensor device at least one patient response to the multi-modal stimuli; and d) determining (230) a sedation state of the sedated patient comprising utilization of the at least one patient response to the multi-modal stimuli.
11. Method according to claim 10, wherein step d) is carried out by a processing unit, and wherein the method comprises step e) outputting (240) by an output unit the sedation state of the sedated patient.
12. Method according to any of claims 10-11, wherein the method comprises step a) selecting (250) the plurality of patient stimulation devices from a larger number of potential patient stimulation devices, the selection comprising utilizing sensory information relating to the sedated patient.
13. Method according to any of claims 10-12, wherein in step c) the at least one patient response comprises a plurality of patient responses, wherein the plurality of patient response are different to each other.
14. A method (300) of image acquisition comprising: a1) determining (310) a sedation state of a sedated patient in an image acquisition unit according to the method (200) of any of claims 10-13; b1) determining (320) by a processing unit at least one scan protocol for the image acquisition unit for the acquisition of image data comprising utilization of the determined sedation state of the patient.
15. A computer program element for controlling an apparatus according to claim any of claims 1-8, which when executed by a processor is configured to carry out the method of any of claims 10-13, and/or for controlling a system according to claim 9, which when executed by a processor is configured to carry out the method of claim 14.
