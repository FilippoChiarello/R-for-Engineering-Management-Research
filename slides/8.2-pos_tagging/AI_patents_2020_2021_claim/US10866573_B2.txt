Cutting fluid supply timing control device and machine learning device
</title>

<abstract>
A machine learning device included in a cutting fluid supply timing control device observes operating state data regarding an operating state of a cutting fluid supply device as a state variable representing a current environment state, acquires supply timing data indicating a timing of supplying a cutting fluid as label data, and then learns the operating state data and the supply timing data in association with each other by using these state variable and label data.

<claims>
1. A cutting fluid supply timing control device which estimates a timing of supplying a cutting fluid by a cutting fluid supply device which supplies the cutting fluid to a work position, the cutting fluid supply timing control device comprising: a machine learning device which learns estimation of the timing of supplying the cutting fluid with respect to an operating state of the cutting fluid supply device, wherein the machine learning device includes a state observation unit which observes operating state data regarding the operating state of the cutting fluid supply device as a state variable representing a current environment state, the operating state data including at least a time elapsed after the previous supply of the cutting fluid is stopped, a label data acquisition unit which acquires supply timing data indicating the timing of supplying the cutting fluid as label data, and a learning unit which learns a correlation between the operating state data and the supply timing data by using the state variable and the label data.
2. The cutting fluid supply timing control device according to claim 1, wherein the learning unit includes an error calculation unit which calculates an error between a correlation model for estimating the timing of supplying the cutting fluid from the state variable and a correlation feature identified from teacher data prepared in advance, and a model updating unit which updates the correlation model so as to reduce the error.
3. The cutting fluid supply timing control device according to claim 1, wherein the learning unit computes the state variable and the label data in a multilayered structure.
4. The cutting fluid supply timing control device according to claim 1, further comprising: an estimation result output unit which outputs an estimation result of the timing of supplying the cutting fluid based on the learning result by the learning unit.
5. The cutting fluid supply timing control device according to claim 1, wherein the machine learning device is present in a cloud server.
6. A machine learning device which learns estimation of a timing of supplying a cutting fluid with respect to an operating state of a cutting fluid supply device which supplies the cutting fluid to a work position, the machine learning device comprising: a state observation unit which observes operating state data regarding the operating state of the cutting fluid supply device as a state variable representing a current environment state, the operating state data including at least a time elapsed after the previous supply of the cutting fluid is stopped; a label data acquisition unit which acquires supply timing data indicating the timing of supplying the cutting fluid as label data; and a learning unit which learns a correlation between the operating state data and the supply timing data by using the state variable and the label data.
