STORING AND VERIFICATION OF DERIVATIVE WORK DATA ON BLOCKCHAIN WITH ORIGINAL WORK DATA
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is technology for storing original work data on a derivative work data blockchain along with code for verifying that derivative work data is derivative of the original work data. The technology involves receiving derivative work data from a submitting entity along with proof data showing that the derivative work is derivative of the original work. If the derivative work data is verified as derivative, then the derivative work data is appended to the derivative work data blockchain.
