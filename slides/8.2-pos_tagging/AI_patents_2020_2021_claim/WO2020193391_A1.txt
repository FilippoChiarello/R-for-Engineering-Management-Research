AN APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR PERFORMING IMAGE-BASED DISH RECOGNITION
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a computer-implemented method for performing image- based dish recognition. The method comprises: acquiring (202) a first image depicting a dish to be recognized; analyzing (204) the first image using a predictive model to determine a first candidate theme; acquiring (206) a reference set of dish identifiers; calculating (208), for each of the dish identifiers in the reference set, an association score indicative of a degree of similarity between the dish represented by the respective dish identifier and the first candidate theme; selecting (210) one or more dish identifiers in the reference set having the highest association scores as one or more variant dish identifiers of the first candidate theme; and outputting (212) the centroid dish identifier of the first candidate theme and the one or more variant dish identifiers of the first candidate theme.
