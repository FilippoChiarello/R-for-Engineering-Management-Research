PORTABLE DEVICE AND METHOD FOR OPERATING THE SAME
</title>

<abstract>
A portable device includes a microphone structure for converting a received audio signal into an electronic signal representing the received audio signal and for transceiving an ultrasonic wave by transmitting the ultrasonic wave and by receiving a reflection of the ultrasonic wave. The portable device includes a control unit for evaluating the reflection of the ultrasonic wave to obtain an evaluation result and for controlling an operation of the portable device based on the evaluation result.
