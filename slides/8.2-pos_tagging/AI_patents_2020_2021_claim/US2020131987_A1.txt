<title>
Method for the predictive maintenance of internal combustion engine components by means of a structure-borne sound sensor
</title>

<abstract>
A method for predictive maintenance of components of an internal combustion engine by a structure-borne sound sensor includes: recording vibrations of the components of the internal combustion engine by at least one structure-borne sound sensor; and during operation of the internal combustion engine, continuously checking a release for diagnosing a wear condition of the components of the internal combustion engine. The one or more structure-borne sound sensors, which are arranged at one or more positions on the internal combustion engine, record measurement signals and forward them to evaluation electronics. The measurement signals are time-synchronized to a characteristic state of the internal combustion engine or the measurement signal recording is time-triggered. The time-synchronized or triggered measurement signals are decoded into measurement data. The decoded measurement data is subjected to a signal transformation. One or more spectrograms are generated from the signal transformation.

<claims>
1. A method for predictive maintenance of components of an internal combustion engine by a structure-borne sound sensor, comprising: recording vibrations of the components of the internal combustion engine by at least one structure-borne sound sensor; and during operation of the internal combustion engine, continuously checking a release for diagnosing a wear condition of the components of the internal combustion engine, wherein the at least one structure-borne sound sensor, which is arranged at one or more positions on the internal combustion engine, records measurement signals and forward them to evaluation electronics, wherein the measurement signals are time-synchronized to a characteristic state of the internal combustion engine or the measurement signal recording is time-triggered, wherein the time-synchronized or triggered measurement signals are decoded into measurement data, wherein the decoded measurement data is subjected to a signal transformation, wherein one or more spectrograms are generated from the signal transformation, wherein the one or more spectrograms are evaluated by one or more mathematical regression models in the evaluation electronics, and the release for diagnosing the state of wear of the components of the internal combustion engine is simultaneously re-tested, wherein, when a release is issued, a process, starting with the signal recording by the structure-borne sound sensor or sensors, runs again until the release expires, wherein an average value is calculated from evaluations generated in this manner so that the average value represents a measurement of the wear of the analyzed component, and wherein the average value is transferred to further units for further processing.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the components of the internal combustion engine comprise a valve drive and/or pistons and/or bearings and/or injection valves and/or turbochargers.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the release for diagnosing the state of wear of components of the internal combustion engine comprises a rotational speed and/or a torque and/or a speed and/or a fluid temperature and/or a number of cycles of the method immediately followed up to now.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein a position of the at least one structure-borne sound sensor is or are optimized to a minimum distance from the component or components to be analyzed, and wherein an axial orientation of the at least one structure-borne sound sensor is approximated to a preferred direction of the vibration propagation.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the at least one structure-borne sound sensor comprises a knock sensor.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein the characteristic state of the internal combustion engine for synchronizing the measuring signals comprises a crank angle.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein the signal transformation comprises a Fourier analysis.
8. The method according to claim 1, wherein a parameterization of the regression model, with which measurement data are compared and an evaluation of which is evaluated as a participant for the wear state, is optimized by machine learning.
9. The method according to claim 1, wherein the wear condition comprises a lash and/or a retention and/or a shape retention and/or a surface condition and/or a functional integrity.
10. The method according to claim 1, wherein the further units to which the average value is transferred comprise: a control unit of the internal combustion engine on which the latter is processed as an input in further functions, or a central server on which a wear and maintenance history is generated and/or a statistical fleet evaluation of structurally identical internal combustion engines is developed and/or a planning of a specific maintenance input is carried out and/or a coordination of resources is planned.
