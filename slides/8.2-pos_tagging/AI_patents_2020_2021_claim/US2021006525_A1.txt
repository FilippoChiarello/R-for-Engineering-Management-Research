SYSTEM AND METHOD TO CREATE GLOBAL CONVERSATION THREAD ACROSS COMMUNICATION CHANNELS
</title>

<abstract>
A system for creating a global conversation thread may include a processor that receives data associated with a plurality of conversation threads, each conversation thread comprising one or more conversations between the same people or the same roles. The processor may identify overlapping conversation threads of the plurality of conversation threads based on the data, and group overlapping conversation threads based on people or roles within the conversations. The processor may apply matching rules to identify related conversations including a targeted feature of interest, and create a global conversation thread based on the identified related conversations, the global conversation thread comprising conversation threads across different platforms.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for creating a global conversation thread in a data processing system comprising a processing device and a memory comprising instructions which are executed by the processor, the method comprising: receiving data associated with a plurality of conversation threads, each conversation thread comprising one or more conversations between the same people or the same roles; identifying overlapping conversation threads of the plurality of conversation threads based on the data; grouping overlapping conversation threads based on people or roles within the conversations; applying matching rules to identify related conversations including a targeted feature of interest, and creating a global conversation thread based on the identified related conversations, the global conversation thread comprising conversation threads across different platforms.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying overlapping conversation threads comprises comparing one or more of timing proximity, intent proximity, or role pattern proximity.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein comparing timing proximity comprises matching the conversations within a selected time period.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein comparing intent proximity comprises comparing a similarity of topics of conversations within the conversation threads.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein comparing role pattern proximity comprises comparing the position of entities in the conversations.
6. The method of claim 2, wherein identifying overlapping conversation threads comprises comparing a combination of timing proximity, intent proximity, and role pattern proximity.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the targeted feature of interest is a financial transaction factor.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the financial transaction factor is an amount of a transaction.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the different platforms comprise a chat-based platform and an email-based platform.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the different platforms comprise a text-based platform and an audio-based platform.
11. A system for creating a global conversation thread comprising a processing device and a memory comprising instructions which are executed by the processor to perform a method comprising: receiving data associated with a plurality of conversation threads, each conversation thread comprising one or more conversations between the same people or the same roles; identifying overlapping conversation threads of the plurality of conversation threads based on the data; grouping overlapping conversation threads based on people or roles within the conversations; applying matching rules to identify related conversations including a targeted feature of interest, and creating a global conversation thread based on the identified related conversations, the global conversation thread comprising conversation threads across different platforms.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein identifying overlapping conversation threads comprises comparing one or more of timing proximity, intent proximity, or role pattern proximity.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein comparing timing proximity comprises matching the conversations within a selected time period.
14. The system of claim 12, wherein comparing intent proximity comprises comparing a similarity of topics of conversations within the conversation threads.
15. The system of claim 12, wherein comparing role pattern proximity comprises comparing the position of entities in the conversations.
16. The system of claim 12, wherein identifying overlapping conversation threads comprises comparing a combination of timing proximity, intent proximity, and role pattern proximity.
17. The system of claim 11, wherein the targeted feature of interest is a financial transaction factor.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the financial transaction factor is an amount of a transaction.
19. The system of claim 11, wherein the different platforms comprise a chat-based platform and an email-based platform.
20. The system of claim 18, wherein the different platforms comprise a text-based platform and an audio-based platform.
21. A computer program product configured to create a global conversation thread, the process comprising: receiving data associated with a plurality of conversation threads, each conversation thread comprising one or more conversations between the same people or the same roles; identifying overlapping conversation threads of the plurality of conversation threads based on the data; grouping overlapping conversation threads based on people or roles within the conversations; applying matching rules to identify related conversations including a targeted feature of interest, and creating a global conversation thread based on the identified related conversations, the global conversation thread comprising conversation threads across different platforms.
