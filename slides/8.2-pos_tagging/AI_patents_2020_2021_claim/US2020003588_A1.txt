OPTICAL FIBER SENSING FOR HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the present disclosure describe systems, methods and structures employing optical fiber sensing to monitor highway/roadway/street conditions (i.e., potholes, pavement cracks, etc.) in real-time, continuously, and while the highway/roadway/street remains in operation (in-service monitoring). Systems, methods, and structures according to aspects of the present disclosure may employ machine learning (ML) algorithms including neural networks to provide and or report on highway conditions so monitored/sensed. Of further advantage, systems, methods, and structures for optical fiber sensing for highway maintenance may operate in real-time, continuously, long-term, in-service, and may employ existing telecommunications optical cables without additional deployment cost(s) or disruption of telecommunications traffic.

<claims>
1. An optical fiber sensing system for highway maintenance comprising: an optical fiber positioned proximate to the highway; a plurality of sensors positioned along, and in optical communication with the optical fiber, said plurality of sensors operative continuously to respond to mechanical vibrations resulting from vehicular traffic, and produce optical signals indicative of the vibrations, said vibrational signals indicative of highway and/or traffic condition and applied to the optical fiber; a fiber sensing interrogator in optical communication with the optical fiber, said interrogator interrogates signals produced by the plurality of sensors and produces data indicative of those signals; a machine learning base intelligent analyzer which analyzes the data produced by the interrogator, determines highway condition and reports the highway condition so determined.
2. The optical fiber sensing system for highway maintenance according to claim 1 wherein the plurality of sensors includes one or more sensors selected from the group consisting of distributed vibrational sensors, distributed acoustic sensors, and distributed temperature sensors.
3. The optical fiber sensing system for highway maintenance according to claim 2 wherein the distributed temperature sensors provide highway surface temperatures.
4. The optical fiber sensing system for highway maintenance according to claim 2 wherein the distributed vibration sensors provide one or more of traffic count and highway surface crack/pothole indications.
5. The optical fiber sensing system for highway maintenance according to claim 2 wherein the distributed acoustic sensors provide highway pavement health indications.
6. The optical fiber sensing system for highway maintenance according to claim 2 wherein the reporting is provided to a maintenance operation.
7. The optical fiber sensing system for highway maintenance according to claim 2 wherein the reporting is provided to a public internet.
8. The optical fiber sensing system for highway maintenance according to claim 2 further comprising: a neural network which classifies data provided by the interrogator.
9. The optical fiber sensing system according to claim 8 wherein the classified data includes pavement crack and pothole classification and their localization.
