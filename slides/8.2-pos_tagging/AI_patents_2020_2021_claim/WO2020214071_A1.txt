RADIO NETWORK NODE AND METHOD FOR REDUCING ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
A method performed by a radio network node for reducing energy consumption in communications with wireless devices is provided. The radio network node comprises a dual-polarized antenna array, which dual-polarized antenna array comprises a first sub-5set antenna array and a second sub-set antenna array for communication with the wireless devices. The radio network node decides (502) whether to (a) deactivate or (b) not deactivate the second sub-set antenna array, to reduce the energy consumption, based on ongoing communications in the radio network node with wireless devices. The first sub-set antenna array and the second sub-set antenna array have a total antenna 10pattern that has a deviation that is below a threshold value.
