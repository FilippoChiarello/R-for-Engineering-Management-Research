SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR POWER OUTAGE PREDICTION
</title>

<abstract>
Described herein is a method and a system for power irregularity prediction. The power irregularity may include black-out and/or brown out events in an electrical grid. In accordance with one aspect, an input data which includes a historical data of black-out and/or brown-out events in the electrical grid is received. Patterns of black-out and/or brown-out events in the electrical grid is determined using one or more machine learning models based at least in part on the historical data of the black-out and/or brown-out events. A future black-out event and/or brown-out event in the electrical grid is predicted based on the patterns of the black-out and/or brown-out events. Prediction data of the future black-out and/or brown-out event in the electrical grid is then outputted by a computing device.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for power irregularity prediction, comprising: receiving, by a computing device, an input data comprising a historical data of black out events in an electrical grid;
determining, by the computing device using one or more machine learning models, patterns of black-out events in the electrical grid based on the input data;
predicting, by the computing device, a future black-out event in the electrical grid based at least in part on the patterns of the black-out events; and
outputting, by the computing device, prediction data of the future black-out event in the electrical grid.
2. The method of claim 1 , wherein the input data further comprises historical data of brown-out events.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising determining, by the computing device using the one or more machine learning models, patterns of brown-out events in the electrical grid based on the input data.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising predicting a future brown-out event in the electrical grid based on the patterns of the brown-out events.
5. The method of any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the input data further comprises grid parameters of the electrical grid.
6. The method of any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the input data further comprises weather and seasonal information.
7. The method of any of claims 1 to 6, further comprising receiving, by the computing device, user input, wherein the user input comprises information of a scheduled maintenance of a grid infrastructure.
8. The method of any of the previous claims, further comprising controlling, by the computing device, one or more power sources and one or more storage devices of a microgrid based on the prediction data.
9. The method of any of the previous claims, further comprising training the one or more machine learning models using the prediction data.
10. A computer program for power irregularity prediction, wherein the computer program is configured to carry out the steps of the method according to any one of claims 1 to 9 when run on a computer.
1 1 . A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium on which the computer program of claim 10 is stored.
12. A system, comprising:
a non-transitory memory device for storing computer-readable program code; and a processor in communication with the memory device, the processor being operative with the computer-readable program code to perform operations comprising
receiving an input data comprising a historical data of black-out events in an electrical grid,
determining, using one or more machine learning models, patterns of black-out events in the electrical grid based on the input data,
predicting a future black-out event in the electrical grid based on the patterns of the black-out events, and
outputting, by the computing device, prediction data of the future black-out event in the electrical grid.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the input data further comprises historical data of brown-out events.
14. The system of claim 13, further comprising determining, by the computing device using the one or more machine learning models, patterns of brown-out events in the electrical grid based on the input data.
15. The system of claim 14, further comprising predicting a future brown-out event in the electrical grid based on the patterns of the brown-out events.
16. The system of any of claims 12 to 15, wherein the input data further comprises grid parameters of the electrical grid.
17. The system of any of claims 12 to 16, wherein the input data further comprises weather and seasonal information.
