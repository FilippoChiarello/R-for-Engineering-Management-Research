MODIFYING A NEURAL NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
The invention discloses an apparatus for modifying a neural network. The apparatus (100) comprises a processor (102) configured to: modify an architecture of a neural network trained for performing a task, by adding at least one unit to the architecture of the neural network, wherein the at least one unit comprises a predictive model configured to determine transformation parameters to be applied to input data; and train the predictive model of the at least one unit to determine the transformation parameters. Methods and a computer program product are also disclosed.
