Display system of vehicle and method of driving the same
</title>

<abstract>
A display system of a vehicle includes a plurality of cameras configured to capture images of front, rear, rear left, and rear right sides of the vehicle and generate image data. The system further includes a plurality of display panels configured to receive and display the image data, and at least one sensor configured to sense a pupil of a driver and at least one of a position, a body direction, or a head height of the driver. A processor determines a position of a field of view of the driver on the basis of the pupil position data and the posture data and generates a display correction value on the basis of the position of the field of view. A display correction device adjusts a horizontal tilt and a vertical tilt of each of the plurality of display panels on the basis of the display correction value.

<claims>
1. A display system of a vehicle, comprising: a plurality of cameras each comprising a respective first image sensor, mounted to the vehicle, and configured to capture images of a respective one of a front side, a rear side, a rear left side, or a rear right side relative to the vehicle and generate image data; a plurality of display panels including first, second, third, and fourth display panels mounted to the vehicle and configured to receive the image data and display one or more of a front side image relative to the vehicle on the first display panel, a rear side image relative to the vehicle on the second display panel, a rear left side image relative to the vehicle on the third display panel, and a rear right side image relative to the vehicle on the fourth display panel; at least one sensor mounted inside the vehicle, comprising a second image sensor mounted inside the vehicle, configured to sense a pupil of a driver and generate pupil position data and configured to sense a side-to-side inclination of the driver and generate posture data based on the sensed side-to-side inclination of the driver; a controller communicatively connected to the at least one sensor and configured to determine a position of a field of view of the driver on the basis of the pupil position data and the posture data, and generate display correction values for adjusting at least one of a horizontal tilt or a vertical tilt of each of the plurality of display panels on the basis of the position of the field of view; and a display correction device communicatively connected to the controller and comprising a drive circuit configured to adjust the at least one of a horizontal tilt or a vertical tilt of each of the first to fourth display panels on the basis of the display correction values, wherein the display correction device adjusts the vertical tilt of each of the first to fourth display panels in an upward direction or a downward direction on the basis of the display correction values, the at least one sensor is configured to sense how far a body of the driver is inclined to the left side or the right side, the display correction values are generated on the basis of how far the body of the driver is inclined to the left side or the right side, and the display correction device adjusts the horizontal tilt of each of the first to fourth display panels in a left direction or a right direction on the basis of the display correction values.
2. The display system of claim 1, further comprising: a memory configured to store driver learning result including at least one of a height, a posture, a face size, an interorbital width, or an eye shape of each of a plurality of people, wherein the controller determines an absolute position of the field of view of the driver on the basis of the stored driver learning result data.
3. The display system of claim 1, wherein the at least one sensor mounted inside the vehicle is configured to sense a position of each of left and right pupils of the driver and generate pupil position data indicative of the sensed position of each of the left and right pupils of the driver, and the controller is configured to determine a position of a field of view of the driver on the basis of the pupil position data indicative of the sensed positions of each of the left and right pupils of the driver.
4. A display system of a vehicle, comprising: a first image sensor, mounted to the vehicle, and configured to capture an image of vehicle surroundings; a display panel mounted to the vehicle and configured to display the image captured through the first image sensor; at least one sensor mounted inside the vehicle, comprising a second image sensor, and configured to sense a position of each of left and right pupils of a driver and configured to sense a side-to-side inclination of the driver; a controller communicatively connected to the at least one sensor and configured to determine a display correction value of the display panel on the basis of the sensed position of each of the left and right pupils of the driver and the sensed side-to-side inclination of the driver; and a display correction device communicatively connected to the controller and configured to adjust at least one of a horizontal tilt or a vertical tilt of the display panel according to the determined display correction value, wherein the at least one sensor is configured to sense how far a body of the driver is inclined to the left side or the right side, the display correction value is generated on the basis of how far the body of the driver is inclined to the left side or the right side, and the display correction device adjusts the horizontal tilt of the display panel in a left direction or a right direction on the basis of the display correction value.
5. The display system of claim 4, wherein the at least one sensor is mounted inside the vehicle to face the driver and is configured to emit infrared rays toward the left and right pupils.
6. The display system of claim 4, wherein the at least one sensor mounted inside the vehicle comprises a plurality of weight detection sensors disposed at different locations in a driver seat of the vehicle to sense a posture of the driver.
7. The display system of claim 4, wherein the display correction device is configured to adjust both the horizontal tilt and the vertical tilt of the display panel according to the determined display correction value.
8. The display system of claim 4, wherein the display system includes a plurality of display panels mounted to the vehicle including the display panel, the controller is configured to determine a display correction value for each of the plurality of display panels on the basis of the sensed position of each of the left and right pupils of the driver and the sensed side-to-side inclination of the driver, and the display correction device is configured to adjust the at least one of the horizontal tilt or the vertical tilt of each of the plurality of display panels according to the determined display correction value for each of the plurality of display panels.
9. A method of driving a display system of a vehicle, comprising: sensing a pupil of a driver of the vehicle using an image sensor mounted inside the vehicle and generating pupil position data; sensing a side-to-side inclination of the driver and generating driver posture data based on the sensed side-to-side inclination of the driver; determining, using a controller communicatively connected to the image sensor, a position of a field of view of the driver on the basis of the pupil position data and the driver posture data; generating, using the controller, display correction values for adjusting at least one of a horizontal tilt or a vertical tilt of each of a plurality of display panels on the basis of the determined position of the field of view of the driver; adjusting, for each of the plurality of display panels disposed at the vehicle, using a drive circuit under control of the controller, the at least one of a horizontal tilt or a vertical tilt of each of the plurality of display panels disposed at the vehicle on the basis of the display correction values; and adjusting, under control of the controller, the vertical tilt of each of the plurality of display panels in an upward direction or a downward direction on the basis of the display correction values, wherein the sensing a side-to-side inclination of the driver comprises sensing how far a body of the driver is inclined to the left side or the right side, the display correction values are generated on the basis of how far the body of the driver is inclined to the left side or the right side, and the method comprises adjusting, under control of the controller, the horizontal tilt of each of the plurality of display panels in a left direction or a right direction on the basis of the display correction values.
