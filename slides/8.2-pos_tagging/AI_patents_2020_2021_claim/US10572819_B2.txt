<abstract>
A system, method, and computer program product for automatically selecting from a plurality of analytic algorithms a best performing analytic algorithm to apply to a dataset is provided. The automatically selecting from the plurality of analytic algorithms the best performing analytic algorithm to apply to the dataset enables a training a plurality of analytic algorithms on a plurality of subsets of the dataset. Then, a corresponding prediction accuracy trend is estimated across the subsets for each of the plurality of analytic algorithms to produce a plurality of accuracy trends. Next, the best performing analytic algorithm is selected and outputted from the plurality of analytic algorithms based on the corresponding prediction accuracy trend with a highest value from the plurality of accuracy trends.
