<title>
AUTOMATED DETECTION OF CODE REGRESSIONS FROM TIME-SERIES DATA
</title>

<abstract>
In non-limiting examples of the present disclosure, systems, methods and devices for detecting and classifying service issues associated with a cloud-based service are presented. Operational event data for a plurality of operations associated with the cloud-based application service may be monitored. A statistical-based unsupervised machine learning model may be applied to the operational event data. A subset of the operational event data may be tagged as potentially being associated with a code regression, wherein the subset comprises a time series of operational event data. A neural network may be applied to the time series of operational event data, and the time series of operational event data may be flagged for follow-up if the neural network classifies the time series as relating to a positive code regression category.
