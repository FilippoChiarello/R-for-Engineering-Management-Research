<title>
Vehicle control device, vehicle control method, and storage medium
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle control device includes a recognizer configured to recognize a surrounding situation of a vehicle, a determiner configured to determine that entry into an intersection is allowed, on the basis of a certain determination condition, when the recognizer has recognized that there is the intersection ahead of the vehicle, a driving controller configured to cause the vehicle to enter the intersection when the determiner has determined that the entry into the intersection is allowed, and a condition changer configured to change the determination condition to a condition under which it is easier for the entry into the intersection to be determined to be allowed in a case in which the intersection recognized by the recognizer is a circular intersection, in comparison with a case in which the intersection recognized by the recognizer is another intersection different from the circular intersection.

<claims>
1. A vehicle control device comprising: a processor; and a memory that stores instructions that, when executed by the processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: recognizing a surrounding situation of a vehicle; determining that entry into an intersection is allowed, based on a determination condition, in response to recognizing that there is the intersection ahead in a traveling direction of the vehicle; facilitating the vehicle to enter the intersection by controlling one or both of steering and a speed of the vehicle in response to determining that the entry into the intersection is allowed; and changing the determination condition to a first condition for the entry into the intersection in response to determining that the intersection is a circular intersection, and changing the determination condition to a second condition in response to determining that the intersection is another intersection different from the circular intersection.
2. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise in response to determining that the intersection is the circular intersection, changing the determination condition to the first condition based on an angle of entry into the circular intersection.
3. The vehicle control device according to claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise not changing the determination condition in response to determining that a partial section of a ring road included in the circular intersection has a straight line shape and a length of the partial section is equal to or greater than a predetermined distance.
4. The vehicle control device according to claim 3, wherein the operations further comprise changing the determination condition to the first condition even when the partial section has the straight line shape and the length of the partial section is equal to or greater than the predetermined distance in response to determining that a road for entry into the circular intersection intersects the partial section at an angle larger than a right angle with respect to a horizontal direction.
5. A vehicle control device comprising: a processing circuitry configured to: recognize a surrounding situation of a vehicle; determine that entry of the vehicle to a second road different from a first road is allowed, based on a determination condition, in response to determining that the vehicle enters the second road from the first road among a plurality of lanes recognized as the surrounding situation; control one or both of steering and a speed of the vehicle to facilitate the vehicle to enter the second road in response to determining that the entry to the second road is allowed; and change the determination condition to a first condition in response to determining that the entry into the second road does not perpendicularly intersect the second road with respect to a horizontal direction, and changing the determination condition to a second condition in response to determining that the first road perpendicularly intersects the second road.
6. A vehicle control method comprising: recognizing, by an in-vehicle computer comprising a processor, a surrounding situation of a vehicle; determining, by the in-vehicle computer, that entry into an intersection is allowed, based on a determination condition, in response to having recognized that there is the intersection ahead in a traveling direction of the vehicle; facilitating, by the in-vehicle computer, the vehicle to enter the intersection by controlling one or both of steering and a speed of the vehicle in response to having determined that the entry into the intersection is allowed; and changing, by the in-vehicle computer, the determination condition to a first condition for the entry into the intersection in response to determining that the intersection is a circular intersection, and changing the determination condition to a second condition in response to determining that the intersection is another intersection different from the circular intersection.
7. A computer-readable non-transitory storage medium storing a program, the program causing an in-vehicle computer to execute: a process of recognizing a surrounding situation of a vehicle; a process of determining that entry into an intersection is allowed, based on a determination condition, in response to having recognized that there is the intersection ahead in a traveling direction of the vehicle; a process of facilitating the vehicle to enter the intersection by controlling one or both of steering and a speed of the vehicle in response to having determined that the entry into the intersection is allowed; and a process of changing the determination condition to a first condition for the entry into the intersection in response to determining that the intersection is a circular intersection, and changing the determination condition to a second condition in response to determining that intersection is another intersection different from the circular intersection.
