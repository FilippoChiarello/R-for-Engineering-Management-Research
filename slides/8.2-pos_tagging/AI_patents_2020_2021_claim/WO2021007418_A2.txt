AUGMENTED REALITY ASSISTED JOINT ARTHROPLASTY
</title>

<claims>
1. A method of providing augmented reality assisted surgery, the method comprising:
generating a virtual scene comprising one or more virtual elements comprising one or more anatomical elements corresponding to one or more anatomy parts;
identifying one or more references in an actual physical scene comprising the one or more anatomy parts;
registering the virtual scene to the one or more references to generate an augmented scene; and
displaying the augmented scene on a display device.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising acquiring one or more images of the actual physical scene.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the one or more references comprise a patientspecific guide placed on the one or more anatomy parts.
4. The method of any of claims 1-3, further comprising:
acquiring at least one image of the one or more anatomy parts; and
segmenting the at least one image to generate one or more virtual 3D models of the one or more anatomy parts.
5. The method of any of claims 1-4, further comprising:
acquiring one or more virtual 3D models of the one or more anatomy parts;
determining one or more implant components based on the one or more virtual 3D models; determining a size and a position for the one or more implant components based on the one or more virtual 3D models; and
wherein the one or more anatomical elements comprise a depiction of the one or more implant components having the determined size in the determined position.
6. The method of any of claims 2-4, wherein the one or more anatomical elements comprise portions of the one or more anatomy parts obscured in the one or more images.
7. The method of any of claim 1-6, wherein the one or more anatomical elements comprise highlights corresponding to the one or more anatomy parts.
8. The method of any of claims 1-7, wherein the one or more references comprise physical markers or objects in the actual physical scene.
9. The method of any of claims 1-8, wherein the one or more references comprise landmarks on the one or more anatomy parts.
10. The method of any claims 1-9, wherein the one or more references comprise landmarks on one or more anatomical 3D models corresponding to the one or more anatomy parts.
11. The method of any of claims 1-10, wherein input of the one or more references is received via a marking device.
12. The method of any of claims 1-11, wherein input of the one or more references is received via a surgical plan.
13. The method of any of claims 1-12, further comprising acquiring one or more virtual 3D models of the one or more anatomy parts, wherein the one or more references are automatically determined by performing shape recognition on the one or more virtual 3D models and the one or more images of the physical scene.
14. The method of any of claims 2-13, further comprising:
performing one or more measurements of the one or more anatomy parts based on the one or more images, wherein the one or more anatomical elements comprise the one or more measurements.
15. The method of any of claims 1-14, wherein the one or more anatomical elements comprise guidance for one or more steps of a surgical procedure, and the one or more anatomical elements are displayed in an order corresponding to the steps of the surgical procedure.
16. The method of any of claims 1-15, wherein the one or more anatomical elements comprise planned or simulated instrument trajectories for performing surgery on the one or more anatomy parts.
17. The method of any of claims 2-16, further comprising determining an alignment between an instrument in the one or more images and a planned trajectory for the instrument, wherein the one or more anatomical elements indicate the alignment.
18. The method of any of claims 2-17, further comprising:
determining, based on the one or more images or another input, which step of a plurality of steps of a surgery the one or more images corresponds to; and
generating at least one of the one or more anatomical elements that belong to the determined step based on the determined step.
19. A non-transitory computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions stored thereon, which, when executed by a processor of a computing device, cause the computing device to perform the method of any of claims 1-18.
20. A computing device comprising:
a memory; and
a processor configured to perform the method of any of claims 1-18.
