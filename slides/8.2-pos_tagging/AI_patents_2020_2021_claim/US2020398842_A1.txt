Vehicle Speed Control Device And Vehicle Speed Control Method
</title>

<abstract>
[Problem] To provide a vehicle speed control device and a vehicle speed control method that allow vehicle speed commands to be followed with high precision. [Solution] Provided is a vehicle speed control device 10 for controlling driving of a vehicle 1 in accordance with a defined vehicle speed command v1 by changing an accelerator position of the vehicle 1, wherein the vehicle speed control device 10 comprises: an accelerator position change amount computation unit 16 that computes an accelerator position change amount θFF based on a current vehicle speed vdet and a requested drive power Fref necessary to fulfill the vehicle speed command v1, computed based on the vehicle speed command v1; and an accelerator position changing unit 12 that changes the accelerator position based on the accelerator position change amount θFF; wherein the accelerator position change amount computation unit 16 computes the accelerator position change amount θFF by using a machine learning device that has been trained by using, as training data, driving history data 17 including drive powers, vehicle speeds, and accelerator position change amounts of the vehicle 1 while being driven.
