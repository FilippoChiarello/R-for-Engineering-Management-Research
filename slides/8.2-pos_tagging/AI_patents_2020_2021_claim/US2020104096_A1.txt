VEHICLE CONVERSATION INFORMATION OUTPUT DEVICE AND CONVERSATION INFORMATION OUTPUT METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle conversation information output device is configured to output conversation information created according to a generated pseudo-emotion and includes: an obtaining part that obtains operation information related to at least one driving operation performed by a driver of a vehicle; a determining part that determines, based on the operation information obtained by the obtaining part, an operation level for the at least one driving operation performed by the driver, the operation level corresponding to the difficulty of the at least one driving operation; a generating part that generates a pseudo-emotion based on the operation level determined by the determining part; a creating part that creates conversation information to be output to the driver based on the pseudo-emotion generated by the generating part; and an outputting part that outputs the conversation information created by the creating part.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A vehicle conversation information output device configured to output conversation information created according to a generated pseudo-emotion, the device comprising: an obtaining part that obtains operation information related to at least one driving operation performed by a driver of a vehicle; a determining part that determines, based on the operation information obtained by the obtaining part, an operation level for the at least one driving operation performed by the driver, the operation level corresponding to the difficulty of the at least one driving operation; a generating part that generates a pseudo-emotion based on the operation level determined by the determining part; a creating part that creates conversation information to be output to the driver based on the pseudo-emotion generated by the generating part; and an outputting part that outputs the conversation information created by the creating part.
2. The vehicle conversation information output device according to claim 1, wherein the determining part determines the operation level according to the number of types of the driving operation performed during a predetermined period of time, the number of types being obtained by the obtaining part.
3. The vehicle conversation information output device according to claim 1, wherein the obtaining part obtains the operation information including a degree of change of the driving operation, and the determining part determines the operation level according to the degree of change obtained by the obtaining part.
4. The vehicle conversation information output device according to claim 1, wherein the determining part determines the operation level based on a weighting factor and the operation information obtained by the obtaining part, the weighting factor being predetermined according to the type of the driving operation and the degree of change of the driving operation.
5. The vehicle conversation information output device according to claim 1, wherein the obtaining part obtains the operation information related to the driving operation that affects the behavior of a vehicle body of the vehicle during travel of the vehicle.
6. The vehicle conversation information output device according to claim 1, wherein the determining part determines the operation level based on the operation information obtained by the obtaining part and operation information previously obtained.
7. A vehicle conversation information output device configured to output conversation information to a driver driving a vehicle, the conversation information being created according to a generated pseudo-emotion, the device comprising: a receiving part that receives an operation level for at least one driving operation performed by the driver, the operation level corresponding to the difficulty of the at least one operation and being determined based on operation information related to the at least one driving operation; a generating part that generates a pseudo-emotion based on the operation level received by the receiving part; a creating part that creates conversation information to be output to the driver based on the pseudo-emotion generated by the generating part; and an outputting part that outputs the conversation information created by the creating part.
8. A conversation information output method for outputting conversation information to a driver driving a vehicle, the method comprising: obtaining operation information related to at least one driving operation performed by the driver; making determination of at least one of an operation level and a motion level based on the obtained operation information, the operation level corresponding to the difficulty of the at least one driving operation performed by the driver, the motion level corresponding to the difficulty of at least one vehicle motion exhibited by the vehicle; and outputting conversation information to the driver based on the determined at least one level.
