<title>
System and method for the assessment of condition in complex operational systems based on multi-level pattern recognition
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method to identify patterns in sets of signals produced during operation of a complex system and combines the identified patterns with records of past conditions to generate operational feedback to one or more machines of the complex system while it operates.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving a plurality of time series signals generated by a plurality of sensors of one or more machines; for each signal of the plurality of time series signals: identifying a base range transformation window for the signal through an iterative process of range reduction, each iteration corresponding to a level and a level range; for each level: transforming the signal into a plurality of digests using the corresponding level range; and inputting the digests for each level as pseudo time-series signals to a transformer to generate a transformation block for the level; composing the transformation blocks for the levels in a range digestion block; generating a resolver block from the range digestion block and known condition episodes; composing a condition recognition block from the range digestion block and the resolver block; and applying a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning to transform the condition recognition block into a feedback signal applied to the one or more machines.
2. The method of claim 1, the feedback signal comprising one of the following: a label of one of the known condition episodes; an auto-generated label that denotes a discovered condition not matching one of the known condition episodes; and an unknown condition denoting a condition not encountered previously, or an anomaly.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the condition recognition block is composed by arranging the range digestion block and the resolver block in series.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the combination of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques comprises clustering, random forest, and nearest-neighbors transformations.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the transformer utilizes one or more of independent component analysis (ICA) and long short-term memory (LSTM).
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the level range to utilize to generate the plurality of digests at each level is varied between levels on a logarithmic scale.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the same set of level ranges is used for each signal.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the set of level ranges is dynamically determined for each signal based on specific characteristics of the signal being digested.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying the base range transformation window for the signal through an iterative process of range reduction comprises decomposing a selected top-range value into sub-ranges, until one of the sub-ranges meets computational efficiency criteria.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the computational efficiency criteria are based on a number of signals, sample rates per signal, and available computational resources.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the sub-ranges are determined through numerical optimization techniques such as entropy minimization in combination with user provided hints.
