OPERATING A FIRE CONTROL SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Operating a fire control system is described herein. One method includes receiving, at a gateway device, first operational data of a first format from a control panel, determining a model associated with the control panel based on the first operational data, wherein the model includes correlations between the first operational data and alarm information of a second format, receiving second operational data of the first format from the control panel, and determining alarm information of the second format associated with the second operational data based on the model.

<claims>
1. A method of operating a fire control system (100), comprising: receiving, at a gateway device (104, 204, 304, 404), first operational data (212) of a first format from a control panel (102, 202, 302); determining a model (220-1) associated with the control panel (102, 202, 302) based on the first operational data (212), wherein the model (220-1) includes correlations between the first operational data (212) and alarm information (324) of a second format; receiving second operational data (312) of the first format from the control panel (102, 202, 302); and determining alarm information (324) of the second format associated with the second operational data (312) based on the model (220-1).
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the model (220-1) is specific to a brand of the control panel (102, 202, 302).
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the method includes receiving the first operational data (212) of the first format from the control panel (102, 202, 302) via a printer port of the control panel (102, 202, 302).
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the method includes receiving the first operational data (212) of the first format from the control panel (102, 202, 302) over a period of time, and wherein a duration of the period of time is user-configurable.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the method includes receiving the first operational data (212) from the control panel (102, 202, 302) in one of: a raw text format and a raw binary format.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the method includes converting the first operational data (212) of the raw text format to first operational data of a structured data format.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein converting the first operational data (212) of the raw text format to the first operational data of the structured data format includes removing new line characters and blank spaces from the first operational data of the raw text format.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the method includes storing the model (220-1) in memory and retrieving the model (220-1) responsive to receiving the second operational data (312).
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the control panel (102, 202, 302) is a first brand of control panel, wherein the model (220-1) a first model specific to the first brand of control panel, and wherein the method includes: receiving first operational data (212) of the first format from a second brand of control panel; determining a second model associated with the second brand of control panel based on the first operational data (212) of the first format from the second brand of control panel, wherein the second model includes correlations between the first operational data (212) of the first format from the second brand of control panel and alarm information (324) of the second format; receiving second operational data (312) of the first format from the second brand of control panel; and determining alarm information (324) of the second format associated with the second operational data (312) of the first format from the second brand of control panel based on the second model.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the method includes: receiving first operational data (212) of the first format from a third brand of control panel; determining a third model associated with the third brand of control panel based on the first operational data (212) of the first format from the third brand of control panel, wherein the third model includes correlations between the first operational data (212) of the first format from the third brand of control panel and alarm information (324) of the second format; receiving second operational data (312) of the first format from the third brand of control panel; and determining alarm information (324) of the second format associated with the second operational data (312) of the first format from the third brand of control panel based on the third model.
