Endocutter control system
</title>

<abstract>
Surgical stapling systems and methods for stapling tissue during a surgical procedure are provided. In an exemplary embodiment, a control system is provided for controlling at least one motor coupled to a drive system on a surgical stapling device for driving one or more drive assemblies. The control system can be configured to communicate with the drive system of the stapling tool and to control and modify movement of one or more drive assemblies based on certain feedback.

<claims>
1. A surgical stapling system, comprising: a stapling tool having a housing and an instrument shaft extending therefrom with an end effector at a distal end thereof, the end effector including a first jaw having a staple cartridge with a plurality of staples therein, and a second jaw in the form of an anvil, the first and second jaws being movable between an open position and a closed position, and the end effector being articulatable relative to the instrument shaft, the stapling tool including a clamping assembly having a cam mechanism configured to translate distally to cam the anvil into a fully closed position, the stapling tool including an articulation assembly configured to articulate the end effector to a plurality of angular orientations relative to the instrument shaft, and the stapling tool including a firing assembly configured to progressively drive the plurality of staples through the staple cartridge toward the anvil for stapling tissue engaged between the staple cartridge and the anvil; and an electronic control system configured to communicate with the stapling tool and to control movement of the articulation assembly, the clamping assembly, and the firing assembly, the electronic control system being configured to adjust, during articulation of the end effector, a longitudinal position of the cam mechanism based on an angular orientation of the end effector to thereby maintain the anvil in the fully open position.
2. The surgical stapling system of claim 1, wherein a change in the longitudinal position of the cam mechanism has a non-linear relationship with the angular orientation of the end effector.
3. The surgical stapling system of claim 1, wherein the control system is configured to cause the cam mechanism to proximally retract as the angular orientation of the end effector increases.
4. The surgical stapling system of claim 1, wherein the control system is configured to proximally retract the cam mechanism at an increasing rate as the angular orientation of the end effector increases.
5. The surgical stapling system of claim 1, wherein the cam mechanism includes a distal closure tube pivotably coupled to a proximal closure tube, and wherein the distal closure tube is coupled to the anvil such that distal advancement of the cam mechanism causes the distal closure tube to apply a closing force to the anvil thereby positioning the anvil in the closed position.
6. The surgical system of claim 1, wherein the housing comprises a tool mounting portion configured to mount to a motor housing on a surgical robot.
7. A surgical stapling system, comprising: an electromechanical tool having an elongate shaft having an end effector at a distal end thereof, the end effector being configured to articulate relative to the elongate shaft such that the end effector can be positioned in a plurality of angular orientations, and the end effector a first jaw having a staple cartridge with a plurality of staples disposed therein, and a second jaw comprising an anvil, the first and second jaws being movable between open and closed positions, a plurality of drive assemblies including a clamping assembly having a cam mechanism configured to translate proximally to cam the anvil into a fully open position, an articulation assembly configured to articulate the end effector to an angular orientation relative to the instrument shaft, and a firing assembly configured to progressively drive the plurality of staples through the staple cartridge toward the anvil for stapling tissue engaged between the staple cartridge and the anvil; and an electronic control system configured to communicate with the electromechanical tool and to control the plurality of drive assemblies, the electronic control system being configured to modify, based on an angular orientation of the end effector and during articulation of the end effector, a longitudinal position of the cam mechanism to thereby maintain the anvil in the fully open position or modify, based on an angular orientation of the end effector, a stroke length of the clamping assembly to cause the first and second jaws to move into the closed position.
8. The surgical system of claim 7, wherein a relationship between a change in the stroke length and a change in the angular orientation of the end effector is non-linear.
9. The surgical system of claim 7, wherein the control system is configured to decrease the stroke length as the angular orientation of the end effector increases.
10. The surgical system of claim 7, wherein the control system is configured to decrease the stroke length at an increasing rate as the angular orientation of the end effector increases.
11. The surgical system of claim 7, wherein a change in the longitudinal position of the cam mechanism has a non-linear relationship with the angular orientation of the end effector.
12. The surgical system of claim 7, wherein the control system is configured to cause the cam mechanism to proximally retract as the angular orientation of the end effector increases.
13. The surgical system of claim 7, wherein the control system is configured to proximally retract the cam mechanism at an increasing rate as the angular orientation of the end effector increases.
14. The surgical system of claim 7, wherein the cam mechanism includes a distal closure tube pivotably coupled to a proximal closure tube, and wherein the distal closure tube is coupled to the anvil such that distal advancement of the cam mechanism causes the distal closure tube to apply a closing force to the anvil thereby positioning the anvil in the closed position.
15. The surgical system of claim 7, further comprising a housing with the elongate shaft extending therefrom, wherein the housing comprises a tool mounting portion configured to mount to a motor housing on a surgical robot.
