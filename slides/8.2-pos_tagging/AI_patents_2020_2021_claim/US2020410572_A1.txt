SELF-CHECKOUT SYSTEM, PURCHASED PRODUCT MANAGEMENT METHOD, AND PURCHASED PRODUCT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
On the basis of a detected change in the display state of the product and of a person included in the captured image or a person whose in-store flow line has been detected, a rearrangement detection means 820 detects that a product has been returned to a different location than the location from which the product was taken. A shopping list generation means 830 uses shelving information on a product shelf to specify a product for which there has been detected a change in the display state that is a result of the person having picked up the product, performs a registration process for registering the specified product on a shopping list that corresponds to the person, and performs a deletion process for deleting the product, which has been returned to the different location than the location from which the product was taken, from the shopping list.

<claims>
1. A self-checkout system comprising a hardware processor configured to execute a software code to: detect a change in a display state of a product on the basis of a captured image of the product; detect that the product has been returned to a different location than the location from which the product was taken on the basis of the change in the display state of the detected and a person included in the captured image or a person whose in-store flow line has been detected; and specify the product for which there has been detected a change in the display state that is a result of the person having picked up the product on the basis of shelving information on a product shelf on which the product has been arranged, perform a registration process for registering the specified product on a shopping list corresponding to the person, and perform a deletion process for deleting the product, which has been returned to the different location than the location from which the product was taken, from the shopping list that corresponds to the person, on the basis of a result of detection indicating that the product has been returned to the different location than the location from which the product was taken and of the shelving information.
2. The self-checkout system according to claim 1, wherein the hardware processor is configured to execute the software code to: associate the detected change in the display state of the product with the person included in the captured image; and detect that the product has been returned to the different location than the location from which the product was taken on the basis of flail an associated result.
3. The self-checkout system according to claim 1, wherein the hardware processor is configured to execute the software code to: set a delete flag to identify the product that has been returned to the different location than the location from which the product was taken to a target product included in the shopping list as a deletion process; and notify the person corresponding to the shopping list of the product with the delete flag set.
4. The self-checkout system according to claim 3, wherein: the shopping list is associated with a device carried by the person; and the hardware processor is configured to execute the software code to notify the device of the product with the delete flag set.
5. The self-checkout system according to claim 4, wherein the hardware processor is configured to execute the software code to receive an instruction indicating whether to delete the product with the delete flag set via the device carried by the notified person and delete the product from the shopping list in the case of receiving an instruction for deleting the product.
6. The self-checkout system according to claim 3, wherein the hardware processor is configured to execute the software code to stop a payment process based on the shopping list in the case where the shopping list includes a product with the delete flag set.
7. The self-checkout system according to claim 1, wherein the hardware processor is configured to execute the software code to detect that a product has been returned to a different location than the location from which the product was taken in the case where a change in one display state represents a decrease in products and a change in the other display state represents an increase in products and in the case where the shape of the area of the change is the same between the change in one display state and the change in the other display state and the area of the change is different in the position between them, with respect to the same person.
8. The self-checkout system according to claim 1, wherein the hardware processor is configured to execute the software code to detect products of the same type displayed in a plurality of locations on the basis of the shelving information, and even in the case where the product has been returned to a different location than the location from which the product was taken but the location is a location where the products of the same type are displayed, detect that the product has been returned to the same location.
9. The self-checkout system according to claim 1, wherein the hardware processor is configured to execute the software code to detect the in-store flow line of a person; detect that a product has been returned to a different location than the location from which the product was taken on the basis of the detected change in the display state of the product and the detected flow line of the person.
10. The self-checkout system according to claim 9, wherein the hardware processor is configured to execute the software code to: authenticate a person in a predetermined location in the store and follows the authenticated person to detect the flow line of the person; and generate a shopping list corresponding to the authenticated person when the authentication has been performed.
11. A purchased product management method comprising: detecting a change in a display state of a product on the basis of a captured image of the product; detecting that the product has been returned to a different location than the location from which the product was taken on the basis of the change in the display state of the detected product and a person included in the captured image or a person whose in-store flow line has been detected; specifying the product for which there has been detected a change in the display state that is a result of the person having picked up the product on the basis of shelving information on a product shelf on which the product has been arranged and performing a registration process for registering the specified product on a shopping list corresponding to the person; and performing a deletion process for deleting the product, which has been returned to the different location than the location from which the product was taken, from the shopping list that corresponds to the person, on the basis of a result of detection indicating that the product has been returned to the different location than the location from which the product was taken and of the shelving information.
12. A non-transitory computer readable information recording medium storing a purchased product management program, when executed by a processor, that performs a method for: detecting a change in a display state of a product on the basis of a captured image of the product; detecting that the product has been returned to a different location than the location from which the product was taken on the basis of the change in the display state of the detected product and a person included in the captured image or a person whose in-store flow line has been detected; specifying the product for which there has been detected a change in the display state that is a result of the person having picked up the product on the basis of shelving information on a product shelf on which the product has been arranged, and performing a registration process for registering the specified product on a shopping list corresponding to the personal; and performing a deletion process for deleting the product, which has been returned to the different location than the location from which the product was taken, from the shopping list that corresponds to the person, on the basis of a result of detection indicating that the product has been returned to the different location than the location from which the product was taken and of the shelving information.
