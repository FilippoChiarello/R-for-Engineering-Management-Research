<abstract>
A method for driving a first vehicle based on information received from a second vehicle, the method may include receiving, by the first vehicle, acquired image information regarding (a) a signature of an acquired image that was acquired by the second vehicle, (b) a location of acquisition of the acquired image; extracting, from the acquired image information, information about objects within the acquired image; and preforming a driving related operation of the first vehicle based on the information about objects within the acquired image.

<claims>
1. A method for driving a first vehicle based on information received from a second vehicle, the method comprises: receiving, by the first vehicle, acquired image information regarding (a) a signature of an acquired image that was acquired by the second vehicle, (b) a location of acquisition of the acquired image; extracting, from the acquired image information, information about objects within the acquired image; and preforming a driving related operation of the first vehicle based on the information about objects within the acquired image.
2. The method according to claim 1 wherein the acquired image information regarding the robust signature of the acquired image is the robust signature of the acquired image.
3. The method according to claim 1 wherein the acquired image information regarding the robust signature of the acquired image is a cortex representation of the signature.
4. The method according to claim 1 comprising: acquiring first vehicle images by the first vehicle; extracting, from the first vehicle acquired images, information about objects within the first vehicle acquired images; and preforming the driving related operation of the first vehicle based on the information about objects within the acquired image and based on the information about objects within the first vehicle acquired images.
5. The method according to claim 1 wherein the image information represents data regarding neurons of a neural network, of the second vehicle, that fired when the neural network was fed with the acquired image.
6. The method according to claim 1 wherein the extracting, of the information about objects within the acquired image comprises: comparing the signature of the acquired image to concept signatures to provide comparison results; each concept signature represents a type of objects; and determining types of objects that are included in the acquired image based on the comparison results.
7. A non-transitory computer readable medium that stores instructions for: receiving, by a first vehicle, acquired image information regarding (a) a signature of an acquired image that was acquired by a second vehicle, (b) a location of acquisition of the acquired image; extracting, from the acquired image information, information about objects within the acquired image; and preforming a driving related operation of the first vehicle based on the information about objects within the acquired image.
8. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 7 wherein the acquired image information regarding the robust signature of the acquired image is the robust signature of the acquired image.
9. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 7 wherein the acquired image information regarding the robust signature of the acquired image is a cortex representation of the signature.
10. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 7 that stores instructions for: acquiring first vehicle images by the first vehicle; extracting, from the first vehicle acquired images, information about objects within the first vehicle acquired images; and preforming the driving related operation of the first vehicle based on the information about objects within the acquired image and based on the information about objects within the first vehicle acquired images.
11. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 7 wherein the image information represents data regarding neurons of a neural network, of the second vehicle, that fired when the neural network was fed with the acquired image.
12. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 7 wherein the extracting, of the information about objects within the acquired image comprises: comparing the signature of the acquired image to concept signatures to provide comparison results; each concept signature represents a type of objects; and determining types of objects that are included in the acquired image based on the comparison results.
13. A computerized system that comprises a processor and multiple units of a first vehicle that are configured to receive acquired image information regarding (a) a signature of an acquired image that was acquired by a second vehicle, (b) a location of acquisition of the acquired image; extract from the acquired image information information about objects within the acquired image; and preform a driving related operation of the first vehicle based on the information about objects within the acquired image.
14. The computerized system according to claim 13 wherein the acquired image information regarding the robust signature of the acquired image is the robust signature of the acquired image.
15. The computerized system according to claim 13 wherein the acquired image information regarding the robust signature of the acquired image is a cortex representation of the signature.
16. The computerized system according to claim 13 that is configured to acquire first vehicle images by the first vehicle; extracting, from the first vehicle acquired images, information about objects within the first vehicle acquired images; and preform the driving related operation of the first vehicle based on the information about objects within the acquired image and based on the information about objects within the first vehicle acquired images.
17. The computerized system according to claim 13 wherein the image information represents data regarding neurons of a neural network, of the second vehicle, that fired when the neural network was fed with the acquired image.
18. The computerized system according to claim 13 that is configured to extract the information about objects within the acquired image by: comparing the signature of the acquired image to concept signatures to provide comparison results; each concept signature represents a type of objects; and determining types of objects that are included in the acquired image based on the comparison results.
