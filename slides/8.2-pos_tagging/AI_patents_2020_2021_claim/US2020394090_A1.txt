<title>
Data Interpretation with Modulation Error Ratio Analysis
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems for analyzing data are disclosed. An example method can comprise receiving a first data signal, decoding the first data signal, determining a second data signal based on the decoded first data signal, and determining a modulation error ratio based on a difference between the first data signal and the second data signal.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: receiving, by a first computing device from a second computing device, a first data signal; determining, by the first computing device based on a mapping of a codeword to a symbol corresponding to a generated portion of the codeword, a second data signal representative of an original data signal sent by the second computing device; and determining, by the first computing device based on a difference between the first data signal and the second data signal, a modulation error ratio.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first data signal represents distortion or interference of the original data signal sent by the second computing device.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining the codeword by decoding, via a low density parity check decoder, at least a portion of the first data signal, wherein the first data signal comprises a plurality of codewords.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining the codeword via a message passing algorithm.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining a plurality of symbols corresponding to the generated portion of the codeword.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the plurality of symbols comprise the symbol and wherein the plurality of symbols comprise sinusoidal signals.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the second data signal represents an estimation of the original data signal transmitted by the second computing device.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the determination of the modulation error ratio is based on timing information comprising one or more of time clock information or frequency clock information.
9. A method, comprising: receiving, by a first computing device from a second computing device, a first data vector; determining, by the first computing device based on applying at least a portion of a modulation procedure to the first data vector, a second data vector associated with an original data vector sent by the second computing device to the first computing device; and determining, by the first computing device based on a difference between the first data vector and the second data vector, a modulation error ratio.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the first data vector represents distortion or interference of the original data vector sent by the second computing device.
11. The method of claim 9, further comprising determining, based on at least a portion of the first data vector and via a low density parity check decoder, a codeword.
12. The method of claim 9, further comprising determining, based on a message passing algorithm, a codeword.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein the difference between the first data vector and the second data vector comprises a vector distance between the first data vector and the second data vector.
14. The method of claim 9, wherein the determination of the modulation error ratio is based on timing information comprising one or more of time clock information or frequency clock information.
15. A method, comprising: receiving, by a first computing device from a second computing device, a plurality of data vectors; determining, by the first computing device and based on a mapping between a sent data vector and a codeword, a correspondence between a received data vector of the plurality of data vectors and the sent data vector; and determining, by the first computing device based on a difference between the sent data vector and the received data vector, an error ratio.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein one or more of the plurality of data vectors represents distortion or interference of the sent data vector sent by the second computing device.
17. The method of claim 15, wherein the mapping between the sent data vector and the codeword comprises conversion of bits of the codeword to corresponding in-phase components and quadrature components of the sent data vector.
18. The method of claim 15, further comprising determining, based on a message passing algorithm, the codeword.
19. The method of claim 15, wherein the difference between the sent data vector and the received data vector comprises a vector distance between the sent data vector and the received data vector.
20. The method of claim 15, wherein the determination of the error ratio is based on timing information comprising one or more of time clock information or frequency clock information.
