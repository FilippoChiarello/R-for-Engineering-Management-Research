INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD, RECORDING MEDIUM, AND INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
An information processing method includes obtaining image information including a first image of a first person in a predetermined facility and a second image of a second person in the predetermined facility; classifying each of the first person and the second person as a resident of the facility or a visitor to the facility, the first person being classified as the resident, the second person being classified as the visitor; calculating a distance between the first person and the second person, based on the first image and the second image; determining whether the first person and the second person are having a conversation with each other, based on the calculated distance; measuring, when it is determined that the first person and the second person are having a conversation with each other, a conversation time during which the first person and the second person are having a conversation with each other; and transmitting, when the measured conversation time exceeds a predetermined time, infection notification information indicating that a risk of the first person contracting infectious disease is high to a terminal apparatus.

<claims>
1. An information processing method executed by a computer, comprising: obtaining image information including a first image of a first person in a predetermined facility and a second image of a second person in the predetermined facility; classifying each of the first person and the second person as a resident of the facility or a visitor to the facility, the first person being classified as the resident, the second person being classified as the visitor; calculating a distance between the first person and the second person, based on the first image and the second image; determining whether the first person and the second person are having a conversation with each other, based on the calculated distance; measuring, when it is determined that the first person and the second person are having a conversation with each other, a conversation time during which the first person and the second person are having a conversation with each other; and transmitting, when the measured conversation time exceeds a predetermined time, infection notification information indicating that a risk of the first person contracting infectious disease is high to a terminal apparatus.
2. The information processing method according to claim 1, further comprising: obtaining infection information indicating whether the second person is infected with the infectious disease; and changing the predetermined time in accordance with the obtained infection information.
3. The information processing method according to claim 1, further comprising measuring, when it is determined that the first person and the second person are not having a conversation with each other during measurement of the conversation time, an interruption time during which the conversation between the first person and the second person is interrupted, wherein the measuring of the conversation time resumes the measurement of the conversation time when the conversation between the first person and the second person is resumed before the measured interruption time exceeds a predetermined time.
4. The information processing method according to claim 1, wherein the determining determines that the first person and the second person are having a conversation with each other when the distance is less than or equal to a predetermined distance.
5. The information processing method according to claim 4, further comprising recognizing an orientation of a face of the first person and an orientation of a face of the second person, based on the image information, wherein the determining determines that the first person and the second person are having a conversation with each other when the distance is less than or equal to the predetermined distance and when the face of the first person and the face of the second person are facing each other.
6. The information processing method according to claim 1, wherein a face image of the first person is pre-registered, and a face image of the first person that is included in the image information matches the pre-registered face image.
7. A recording medium storing a program that, when executed by a computer, causes the computer to execute a process, the recording medium being a non-volatile computer-readable recording medium, the process comprising: obtaining image information including a first image of a first person in a predetermined facility and a second image of a second person in the predetermined facility; classifying each of the first person and the second person as a resident of the facility or a visitor to the facility, the first person being classified as the resident, the second person being classified as the visitor; calculating a distance between the first person and the second person, based on the first image and the second image; determining whether the first person and the second person are having a conversation with each other, based on the calculated distance; measuring, when it is determined that the first person and the second person are having a conversation with each other, a conversation time during which the first person and the second person are having a conversation with each other; and transmitting, when the measured conversation time exceeds a predetermined time, infection notification information indicating that a risk of the first person contracting infectious disease is high to a terminal apparatus.
8. An information processing system comprising: a camera that is installed in a predetermined facility; and an information processing apparatus, wherein the information processing apparatus obtains image information from the camera, the image information including a first image of a first person in the predetermined facility and a second image of a second person in the predetermined facility, classifies each of the first person and the second person as a resident of the facility or a visitor to the facility, the first person being classified as the resident, the second person being classified as the visitor, calculates a distance between the first person and the second person, based on the first image and the second image, determines whether the first person and the second person are having a conversation with each other, based on the calculated distance, measures, when it is determined that the first person and the second person are having a conversation with each other, a conversation time during which the first person and the second person are having a conversation with each other, and transmits, when the measured conversation time exceeds a predetermined time, infection notification information indicating that a risk of the first person contracting infectious disease is high to a terminal apparatus.
