<title>
INFORMATION PROCESSING DEVICE, OBJECT MEASUREMENT SYSTEM, OBJECT MEASUREMENT METHOD, AND PROGRAM STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
An information processing device includes a detection unit and a calculation unit. The detection unit detects, as a measurement use point, a portion that is used for prescribed length measurement of the object, in each of sectioned regions, in an object image included in the photographed image, set on both sides with respect to a reference line which is set for the object image and by which the object image is sectioned. The calculation unit calculates the length of a segment, in each of the sectioned regions, between the measurement use point and the intersection point between the reference line and a perpendicular line passing through the measurement use point and being perpendicular to the reference line. Further, the calculation unit calculates a length, in the object, to be measured, by adding together the calculated lengths of the segments.

<claims>
1. An information processing device comprising: at least one processor configured to: when an object image is divided by a baseline, detect a predetermined portion of an object to be measured as a measurement-use point in each of divided areas on both sides of the baseline in the object image, the object image being an image of the object in a captured image in which the object is captured, the baseline being set to the object image, the predetermined portion being a portion to be used for length measurement; and calculate, in each of the divided areas, a length of a line segment between an intersection point of a perpendicular that passes through the measurement-use point and is perpendicular to the baseline and the baseline and the measurement-use point, and calculate a length to be measured on the object by adding the lengths of the line segments each of which is calculated in one of the divided areas.
2. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the measurement-use point that the at least one processor detects is a portion that bulges in a direction orthogonal to the baseline in each of the divided areas in the object image.
3. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the at least one processor further has a function of detecting ends of the object image in a direction along the baseline by use of reference data learned through machine learning and setting a line connecting the detected ends as the baseline.
4. The information processing device according to claim 3, wherein the at least one processor further has a function of also calculating a length between both ends of the baseline set as a length to be measured on the object.
5. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to calculate a weight of the object by use of the calculated length to be measured and data for weight calculation with which a weight of the object is calculated from the length.
6. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to when the object is in a state different from a preset standard state, correct the detected measurement-use point by use of data for correction provided in advance.
7. The information processing device according to claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to, when the at least one processor cannot detect the measurement-use point, estimate the measurement-use point in accordance with a rule provided in advance.
8. An object measurement system comprising: an image capturing device that captures an image of an object to be measured; and the information processing device according to claim 1.
9. An object measurement method comprising by a computer: when an object image is divided by a baseline, detecting a predetermined portion of an object to be measured as a measurement-use point in each of divided areas on both sides of the baseline in the object image, the object image being an image of the object in a captured image in which the object is captured, the baseline being set to the object image, the predetermined portion being a portion to be used for length measurement; calculating, in each of the divided areas, a length of a line segment between an intersection point of a perpendicular that passes through the measurement-use point and is perpendicular to the baseline and the baseline and the measurement-use point; and calculating a length to be measured on the object by adding the lengths of the line segments each of which is calculated in one of the divided areas.
10. A non-transitory program storage medium storing a computer program causing a computer to perform: when an object image is divided by a baseline, detecting a predetermined portion of an object to be measured as a measurement-use point in each of divided areas on both sides of the baseline in the object image, the object image being an image of the object in a captured image in which the object is captured, the baseline being set to the object image, the predetermined portion being a portion to be used for length measurement; calculating, in each of the divided areas, a length of a line segment between an intersection point of a perpendicular that passes through the measurement-use point and is perpendicular to the baseline and the baseline and the measurement-use point; and calculating a length to be measured on the object by adding the lengths of the line segments each of which is calculated in one of the divided areas.
