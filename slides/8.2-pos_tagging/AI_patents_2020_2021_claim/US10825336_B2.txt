Connected gateway
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods, and computer-readable media are presented herein for providing lower level physical-layer gateway functionalities and upper-level application functionalities; a system designed with flexible configurations in order to support a wide range of connected applications. The system includes a processor that executes machine instructions to perform operations. The operations comprise: receiving sensor data from a sensor device located in a building; converting the sensor data from a raw state to a physical measurement; and activating an abatement device situated in the building as a function of the physical measurement.

<claims>
1. A system, comprising: a memory to store computer executable instructions; and a processor, communicatively coupled to the memory, that facilitates or effectuates execution of the computer executable instructions to perform operations, comprising: receiving data from a home energy management system located in a habitable structure; utilizing a conversion equation to convert the data from a raw state to a physical measurement; switching, as a function of the physical measurement, supplied electrical power from a first power source to a second power source, wherein the second power source is a solar panel or a wind turbine associated with the habitable structure; and in response to receiving data representing a request to modify a network establishment technology employed to perform uplink transmissions from a first connection technology representative of a first wireless standard to a second connection technology representative of a second wireless standard, adjusting transmission parameters to use the second wireless standard.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising multiple interchangeable modular radio aspects.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the second power source is the solar panel.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the switching further comprises determining whether the physical measurement falls below a defined unit cost.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the home energy management system includes a thermostat, a controller, or an energy storage facility that includes the second power source.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise converting the data from the raw state to the physical measurement as a function of a calibration chart or a calibration table.
7. A method, comprising: obtaining data, by a system comprising a processor, from a home energy management system located in a habitable structure; converting the data, by the system, from a raw state to a physical measurement based on a conversion equation; based on the physical measurement, switching, by the system, supplied electrical power from a first power source to a second power source, wherein the second power source is a solar panel or a wind turbine associated with the habitable structure; and in response to receiving data representing a request to modify a network establishment technology employed to perform uplink transmissions from a first connection technology representative of a first wireless standard to a second connection technology representative of a second wireless standard, adjusting transmission parameters to use the second wireless standard.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein converting the data for transmission through the multiple interchangeable modular radio aspects.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the second power source is the solar panel.
10. The method of claim 7, further comprising determining whether the physical measurement falls below a defined unit cost.
11. The method of claim 7, wherein the home energy management system includes a thermostat, a controller, or an energy storage facility that includes the second power source.
12. The method of claim 7, further comprising converting the data, by the system, from the raw state to the physical measurement as a function of a calibration chart or a calibration table.
13. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium comprising executable instructions that, when executed by a processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: converting data received from a home management system from a raw state to a physical measurement based on a conversion equation; in response to determining the physical measurement, switching supplied electrical power from a first power source to a second power source, wherein the second power source is a solar panel or a wind turbine associated with the habitable structure.
14. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein the second power source is the solar panel.
15. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein converting data comprises generating a physical measurement that is transmittable through multiple interchangeable modular radio aspects.
16. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein the operations further comprise determining whether the physical measurement falls below a set point representing a defined unit cost.
17. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, further comprising converting the data from the raw state to the physical measurement as a function of a calibration chart or a calibration table.
