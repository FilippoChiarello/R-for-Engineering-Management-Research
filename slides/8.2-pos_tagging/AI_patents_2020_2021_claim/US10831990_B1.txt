DEBIASING TEXTUAL DATA WHILE PRESERVING INFORMATION
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the present invention disclose a method for debiasing text by neutralizing subjective information while preserving relevant information. The method includes one or more processors determining a sentiment of textual data. The method further includes extracting information that is relevant to resolving a topic that is represented in the textual data. The method further includes debiasing the information that is relevant to resolving a topic that is represented in the textual data. The method further includes validating that the debiased information includes the information that is relevant to resolving the topic that is represented in the textual data. The method further includes generating debiased textual data, the debiased textual data including the debiased information and masking the determined sentiment of the textual data.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: determining, by one or more processors, a sentiment of textual data corresponding to a service request of a user; extracting, by one or more processors, information that is relevant to resolving a topic that is represented in the textual data; debiasing, by one or more processors, the textual data of the service request of the user, wherein debiasing the textual data further comprises: appending, by one or more processors, a token to one or more segments of textual data corresponding to the information that is relevant to resolving the topic, wherein the token corresponds to a side constraint that indicates a polarity of the sentiment of the information; validating, by one or more processors, that the debiased textual data of the service request includes a neutral polarity and the information that is relevant to resolving the topic that is represented in the textual data; and generating, by one or more processors, a debiased service request, that includes the one or more segments of textual data with a neutral polarity and the information that is relevant to resolving the topic, wherein the determined sentiment of the textual data is masked.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein extracting information that is relevant to resolving a topic that is represented in the textual data, further comprises: segmenting, by one or more processors, the textual data to include a respective sentiment annotation; parsing, by one or more processors, segments of the textual data to identify information relevant to one or more domains associated with the textual data, wherein the identified information is selected from the group consisting of: entities, actions, observed behavior, expressive tone, products, product versions, and error codes; and retaining, by one or more processors, the parsed segment of the textual data that include the identified information relevant to one or more domains associated with the textual data.
3.
