METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING FEATURE CONTRIBUTION TO PERFORMANCE
</title>

<abstract>
A method of determining the contribution of a process feature to the performance of a process of patterning substrates. The method may comprise obtaining (402) a first model trained on first process data and first performance data. One or more substrates may be identified (404) based on a quality of prediction of the first model when applied to process data associated with the one or more substrates. A second model may be trained (406) on second process data and second performance data associated with the identified one or more substrates. The second model may be used (408) to determine the contribution of a process feature of the second process data to the second performance data associated with the one or more substrates.
