SIGNAL PROCESSING APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR ENHANCING A DIGITAL INPUT SIGNAL
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a signal processing apparatus (1) for enhancing a digital input signal (I(x i )) recorded by a recording system (4) having a system response (H(x i )), wherein the apparatus is configured to retrieve the digital input signal; compute a baseline estimate (f(x i )) of the digital input signal, the baseline estimate comprising spatial features of the digital input signal that are larger than a feature length (fl)\ remove the baseline estimate from the digital input signal to obtain an output signal (O(x i )) comprising spatial features that are smaller than the feature length wherein the apparatus is configured to retrieve a characteristic length (cl) of the system response and compute the baseline estimate (f(x i )) using a feature length that is smaller than the characteristic length of the system response.
