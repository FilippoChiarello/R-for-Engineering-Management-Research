INFORMATION TRANSMITTING METHOD, AND CLIENT DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
An information transmission method in a client device (2002) provided in a mobile object includes: obtaining sensor information that has been obtained by a sensor provided in the mobile object and indicates a surrounding state of the mobile object, and storing the sensor information into a storage (2012) (S2001); determining whether the mobile object is present in an environment in which the mobile object is capable of transmitting the sensor information to a server (2001) (S2002); and transmitting the sensor information to the server (2001) when the mobile object is determined to be present in the environment in which the mobile object is capable of transmitting the sensor information to the server (2001) (YES in S2002) (S2003).

<claims>
1. An information transmission method in a client device provided in a mobile object, the information transmission method comprising: obtaining sensor information that has been obtained by a sensor provided in the mobile object and indicates a surrounding state of the mobile object, and storing the sensor information into a storage; determining whether the mobile object is present in an environment in which the mobile object is capable of transmitting the sensor information to a server; and transmitting the sensor information to the server when the mobile object is determined to be present in the environment in which the mobile object is capable of transmitting the sensor information to the server.
2. The information transmission method according to claim 1, further comprising: creating, from the sensor information, three-dimensional data of a surrounding area of the mobile object; and estimating a self-location of the mobile object using the three-dimensional data created.
3. The information transmission method according to claim 2, further comprising: transmitting a transmission request for a three-dimensional map to the server; and receiving the three-dimensional map from the server, wherein in the estimating, the self-location is estimated using the three-dimensional data and the three-dimensional map.
4. The information transmission method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the sensor information includes at least one of information obtained by a laser sensor, a luminance image, an infrared image, a depth image, sensor position information, or sensor speed information.
5. The information transmission method according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the sensor information includes obtainment location information indicating a position of the mobile object or the sensor when the sensor obtained the sensor information.
6. The information transmission method according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
wherein the sensor information includes obtainment time information indicating a time when the sensor obtained the sensor information.
7. The information transmission method according to claim 6, further comprising: obtaining time information from the server; and generating the obtainment time information using the time information obtained.
8. The information transmission method according to any one of claims 1 to 7, further comprising: receiving, from the server, a sensor information transmission request including specification information specifying a location and a time; and when sensor information obtained at a location and a time indicated by the specification information is stored in the storage, and the mobile object is determined to be present in the environment in which the mobile object is capable of transmitting the sensor information to the server, transmitting, to the server, the sensor information obtained at the location and the time indicated by the specification information.
9. The information transmission method according to any one of claims 1 to 8, further comprising:
deleting, from the storage, the sensor information that has been transmitted to the server.
10. The information transmission method according to any one of claims 1 to 9, further comprising:
deleting the sensor information from the storage when a difference between a position of the mobile object or the sensor when the sensor obtained the sensor information and a current position of the mobile object or the sensor exceeds a predetermined distance.
11. The information transmission method according to any one of claims 1 to 10, further comprising:
deleting the sensor information from the storage when a difference between a time when the sensor obtained the sensor information and a current time exceeds a predetermined time.
12. A client device provided in a mobile object, the client device comprising: a processor; and memory, wherein using the memory, the processor: obtains sensor information that has been obtained by a sensor provided in the mobile object and indicates a surrounding state of the mobile object, and stores the sensor information into a storage; determines whether the mobile object is present in an environment in which the mobile object is capable of transmitting the sensor information to a server; and transmits the sensor information to the server when the mobile object is determined to be present in the environment in which the mobile object is capable of transmitting the sensor information to the server.
