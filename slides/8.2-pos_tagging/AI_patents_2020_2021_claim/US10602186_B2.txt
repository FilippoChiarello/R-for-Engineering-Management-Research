<title>
Systems and methods for mask based processing of a block of a digital image
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided an apparatus for generating a set of transform coefficients of a block in a frame or portion thereof. The apparatus includes a media encoder coupled to a data interface configured to receive a frame or portion thereof. The media encoder is configured to: designate a rotational symmetry mask having a size and a shape as the block partitioned in the frame or portion thereof for processing the block; split the block to two complementary portions using the rotational symmetry mask; generate a pair of rotational symmetry blocks each having one of the two complementary portions; and compute a transform coefficient for each member of the pair of rotational symmetry blocks.

1. An apparatus for generating a set of transform coefficients of a block in a frame, series of frames, or portion thereof, the apparatus comprising: a media encoder coupled to a data interface adapted to receive a frame, series of frames, or portion thereof, wherein the media encoder is configured to: identify one or more predictors in the frame, series of frames, or portion thereof; designate a rotational symmetry mask, based on the one or more predictors, and having a size and a shape as the block partitioned in the frame, series of frames, or portion thereof for processing the block; split the block to two complementary portions using the rotational symmetry mask; generate a pair of rotational symmetry blocks each having one of the two complementary portions; and compute a transform coefficient for each member of the pair of rotational symmetry blocks.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the media encoder is configured to generate each pair of rotational symmetry blocks in a size and a shape of the block by adding complementary data to the respective portion of one of the two complementary portions.

4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein: the data interface is further configured to receive at least one transform coefficient representing at least one member of a pair of rotational symmetry blocks, the transform coefficients coding a block in a frame or portion thereof, and a signal representing an associated designated rotation symmetry mask having a size and a shape as the block partitioned in the frame or portion thereof for processing the block; and the media encoder is further configured to: compute the pair of rotational symmetry blocks based on inverse transform of the received at least one transform coefficient, each member of the pair of rotational symmetry blocks having one of two complementary portions, and reconstruct a block partitioned in same frame or portion thereof from the two complementary portions based on the rotational symmetry mask.
5. A method for generating a set of coefficients of a block in a frame, series of frames, or portion thereof, the method comprising: identifying one or more predictors in the frame, series of frames, or portion thereof; designating, based on the identified one or more predictors in the frame, series of frames, or portion thereof, a rotational symmetry mask having a size and a shape as a block partitioned in the frame or portion thereof for processing the block; splitting the block to two complementary portions using the rotational symmetry mask; generating a pair of rotational symmetry blocks each having one of the two complementary portions; and computing a transform coefficient for each member of the pair of rotational symmetry blocks.
