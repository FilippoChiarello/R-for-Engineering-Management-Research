</title>

<abstract>
A positioning cycle adjustment method comprising: obtaining, by a mobile device, a group of environment record information in a current environment; determining, by the mobile device, a location change rate value of the mobile device based on obtained N groups of environment record information, where N is greater than or equal to 2; and then adjusting a positioning cycle of the mobile device based on the determined location change rate value. This application is used to adjust the positioning cycle of the mobile device.
