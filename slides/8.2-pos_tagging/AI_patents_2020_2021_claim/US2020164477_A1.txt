MACHINE TOOL
</title>

<abstract>
Provided is a machine tool including: a main shaft; feed-axis motors that relatively move a table and the main shaft in directions intersecting the longitudinal axis of the main shaft; feed-load measurement units that measure the magnitudes of loads applied to the feed-axis motors; and an anomaly detection unit that detects abnormal loads on the feed-axis motors when the magnitudes of the loads measured by the feed-load measurement units are greater than a predetermined threshold, wherein the predetermined threshold is changed according to the length of a tool that is held by the main shaft.

<claims>
1. A machine tool comprising: a main shaft that holds a tool; a feed-axis motor that relatively moves a table to which a workpiece is fixed and the main shaft, in a direction intersecting the longitudinal axis of the main shaft; a feed-load measurement unit that measures the magnitude of a load applied to the feed-axis motor; an anomaly detection unit that detects an abnormal load on the feed-axis motor when the magnitude of the load measured by the feed-load measurement unit is greater than a predetermined threshold; and wherein the predetermined threshold is changed according to the length of a tool that is held by the main shaft.
2. The machine tool according to claim 1, wherein the predetermined threshold is reduced as the tool, which is held by the main shaft, becomes longer.
3. The machine tool according to claim 1, further comprising a storage unit that stores a correspondence table in which the length of the tool and the predetermined threshold are associated with each other.
4. The machine tool according to claim 1, wherein the anomaly detection unit calculates the predetermined threshold from the length of the tool, which is held by the main shaft.
5. The machine tool according to claim 1, further comprising: two bearing parts that are disposed with a space therebetween in the direction along the longitudinal axis of the main shaft and that support the main shaft in a manner allowing the main shaft to rotate about the longitudinal axis of the main shaft; and wherein the predetermined threshold is set on the basis of the length of the tool, the space between the two bearing parts, and the distance from the distal end of the main shaft to the bearing part that is disposed close to a proximal end.
6. The machine tool according to claim 5, wherein the predetermined threshold is set on the basis of a load fmax defined by the following expression (1); where: Fmax indicates a permissible load on the bearing parts; fmax indicates a load applied to a distal end of the tool when the permissible load is applied to the bearing parts; L indicates the length of the tool, which is the length from the distal end of the tool to the distal end of the main shaft; Xa indicates the distance from the distal end of the main shaft to the bearing part that is disposed close to the proximal end, in the direction along the longitudinal axis of the main shaft; and Xb indicates the distance from the distal end of the main shaft to the bearing part that is disposed close to the distal end, in the direction along the longitudinal axis of the main shaft.
7. The machine tool according to claim 1, wherein the predetermined threshold is changed according to the diameter of the tool, which is held by the main shaft; and wherein the predetermined threshold is reduced as the diameter of the tool, which is held by the main shaft, becomes smaller.
8. The machine tool according to claim 1, further comprising: a main-shaft motor that rotates the main shaft about the longitudinal axis of the main shaft; a rotational-load measurement unit that measures the magnitude of a load applied to the main-shaft motor; and wherein the anomaly detection unit changes the predetermined threshold on the basis of the length of the tool and the magnitude of the load on the main-shaft motor measured by the rotational-load measurement unit.
9. The machine tool according to claim 8, wherein the predetermined threshold is reduced as the load on the main-shaft motor becomes smaller.
10. The machine tool according to claim 1, further comprising a notification unit that notifies an operator of the abnormal load when the abnormal load is detected by the anomaly detection unit.
11. The machine tool according to claim 10, further comprising: a control unit that controls the feed-axis motor; wherein the predetermined threshold includes a first threshold and a second threshold that is larger than the first threshold; wherein the notification unit displays a warning message when the magnitude of the measured load is greater than the first threshold and is equal to or less than the second threshold; and wherein the control unit stops the feed-axis motor when the magnitude of the measured load is greater than the second threshold.
