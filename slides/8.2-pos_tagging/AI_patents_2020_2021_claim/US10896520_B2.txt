<title>
System and method for moment capturing
</title>

<abstract>
An imagery method includes obtaining a plurality of images of an object captured using one or more imaging devices within a period of time while the object is being tracked, performing motion and/or state estimation of the object for the period of time, and selecting one or more images related to a moment from the plurality of images based on the motion and/or state estimation of the object.

<claims>
1. An imagery method, comprising: obtaining a plurality of first images of an object, wherein the plurality of images are captured using a main imaging device configured at a first location on a movable platform within a period of time while the object is being tracked; obtaining one or more second images of the object within the period of time from one or more image sensors configured at one or more second locations on the movable platform, the one or more second locations being different from the first location, and the one or more second images being synchronized with the plurality of first images; performing motion or state estimation of the object for the period of time by analyzing the one or more second images according to a perspective transformation that compensates for field-of-view differences between the main imaging device and the one or more image sensors; and selecting one or more images related to a moment from the plurality of first images based on the motion or state estimation of the object.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: maintaining the plurality of first images in an image buffer.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: causing the main imaging device to capture the plurality of first images upon receiving a trigger.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the trigger is an indicator that is detected from a previously-captured image of the object or a signal received from the object.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein the plurality of first images are buffered at a frequency that is predetermined or dynamically configured based on a rule.
6. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: obtaining a plurality of sets of the first images of the object from a plurality of angles simultaneously for the period of time, each set of the first images being obtained by one of a plurality of main imaging devices configured on one of a plurality of movable platforms; for each of the plurality of sets of the first images, selecting one or more images related to the moment based on the motion or the state estimation of the object; and select among the one or more selected images from an angle according to a user input.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the motion information of the object is obtained by analyzing a movement of a bounding box that is used to identify the object in the one or more images that are used to track the object.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the movable platform is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving one or more location signals from the object; and determining motion information of the object based on the one or more location signals received from the object.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining a time interval based on a selecting rule; wherein the one or more images are selected further based on the time interval.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising: storing the selected images in an image buffer.
12. The method of claim 10, further comprising: identifying an image from the selected images based on a user input.
13. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), comprising: a memory that stores one or more computer-executable instructions; and one or more processors configured to access the memory and execute the computer-executable instructions to perform a method comprising: directing the UAV to track an object; obtaining a plurality of first images of the object, wherein the plurality of images are captured by a main imaging device configured at a first location on the UAV within a period of time while the object is being tracked; obtaining one or more second images of the object within the period of time from one or more image sensors configured at one or more second locations on the UAV, the one or more second locations being different from the first location, and the one or more second images being synchronized with the plurality of first images; performing motion or state estimation of the object for the period of time by analyzing the one or more second images according to a perspective transformation that compensates for field-of-view differences between the main imaging device and the one or more image sensors; and selecting one or more images related to a moment from the plurality of images based on the motion or state estimation of the object.
14. An imagery system, comprising: one or more microprocessors; a controller running on the one or more microprocessors, wherein the controller operates to obtain a plurality of first images of an object, wherein the plurality of images are captured using a main imaging device configured at a first location on a movable platform within a period of time while the object is being tracked; obtain one or more second images of the object within the period of time from one or more image sensors configured at one or more second locations on the movable platform, the one or more second locations being different from the first location, and the one or more second images being synchronized with the plurality of first images; perform motion or state estimation of the object for the period of time by analyzing the one or more second images according to a perspective transformation that compensates for field-of-view differences between the main imaging device and the one or more image sensors; and select one or more images related to a moment from the plurality of first images based on the motion or state estimation of the object.
15. The imagery system of claim 14, wherein the controller operates to maintain the plurality of first images in an image buffer.
16. The imagery system of claim 15, wherein the controller operates to cause the main imaging device to capture the plurality of first images upon receiving a trigger.
17. The imagery system of claim 16, wherein the plurality of first images are buffered at a frequency that is predetermined or dynamically configured based on a rule.
18. The imagery system of claim 16, wherein the trigger is an indicator that is detected from a previously-captured image of the object or a signal received from the object.
