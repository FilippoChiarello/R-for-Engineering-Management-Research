Systems and methods for predictive document coding using continuous active machine learning
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for predictive document coding using continuous active machine learning are described herein. A method uses both a primary queue and a plurality of secondary queues, where each secondary queue is associated with a model for category of documents. The method also repeatedly classifies new batches selected from a large set of documents that have not been reviewed. The classification uses the plurality of models and updates the secondary queues from the best documents in the most recently classified batch. While the method transparently cycles through batches, the most relevant documents are provided to one or more human reviewers from secondary queues via a primary queue. The reviewer confirms relevance or non-relevance in each of the documents for each of the categories. Periodically all the models are retrained using the set of reviewed documents after a selectable number of documents have been reviewed since the most recent retraining.
