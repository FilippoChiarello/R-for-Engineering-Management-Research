<title>
METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR TREATING CANCER BASED ON RESPONSE PREDICTION USING LIGHT SCATTERING TECHNOLOGY
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are methods and systems that make use of light scattering techniques, such as the use of a multiphoton laser-scanning microscope, to quantify the scattering directionality of second harmonic generation (SHG) from biopsy samples of cancer in order to predict efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
</abstract>

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method of treating a subject with cancer, the method comprising:
a. obtaining a sample from cancerous tissue of the subject;
b. preparing the sample for a light scattering test;
c. applying second harmonic generation (SHG) two photon scattering measurements from the sample to determine directionality of scattered photons;
d. obtaining a signature score using selected data from SHG data; e. determining if the signature score falls above or below a reference level, wherein if the signature score is above the reference level, the subject is treated with neoadjuvant therapy, and if the signature score is below the reference level, the subject is subjected to surgical treatment.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the sample is a needle biopsy sample.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the needle biopsy sample is a core needle biopsy sample.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the cancer is breast cancer, prostate cancer, or thyroid cancer.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the breast cancer is HER2+ and ER+ breast cancer.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject was diagnosed with cancer before the method of claim 1 is carried out.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject is diagnosed with cancer after the
sample is obtained and prepared.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein SHG is carried out at the tumor-host interface in collagen rich tumor stroma next to tumor bulk containing more cancer cells than stroma.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the sample of step b) is prepared by:
i. sectioning the sample;
ii. mounting the sample on a slide; and
iii. staining the slide with hematoxylin and eosin (H+E).
10. The method of claim 1, wherein SHG is used to determine forwards-to-backwards (F/B) scattering ratio.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein SHG is carried out using a multiphoton laser scanning microscope.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject who undergoes neoadjuvant
chemotherapy later undergoes surgery as well.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the signature score is also calculated based on the age, sex, race, family history, and/or lifestyle of the subject.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the signature score is also calculated based on
relevant genetic markers of the subject.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein said reference levels are determined using samples from previously assayed subjects who have undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein the reference levels are determined by comparing samples of subjects who were effectively treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus those who were not.
17. A system for evaluating a sample of tissue from a subject with cancer to determine treatment outcome using neoadjuvant chemotherapy, comprising:
a. an SHG optical imaging device for generating correlated test image pairs in the forward and backward direction or test imaging data from the sample where each pixel represents the ratio of the forward to backward two photon light scatter intensities or photon counts from SHG; and
b. a processor for analyzing said test image pairs or test imaging directional data from a point by point measurement of the sample, said processor using a quantitative algorithm for analyzing said test image or test imaging directional data for detection of a signature distribution of values from a region of interest (ROI) related to treatment outcome using neoadjuvant chemotherapy, wherein said signature distribution of values is used to generate a signature score.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein said system comprises a partially automated
system or a fully automated system.
19. The system of claim 17, wherein said processor uses a pattern recognition algorithm or machine learning on SHG data or images of SHG data to find the ROI to analyze said test image or test imaging data.
20. The system of claim 17, wherein said optical imaging device is multiphoton laser scanning microscopy.
21. The system of claim 17, wherein said processor uses said quantitative algorithm to compare said test image or test imaging data with a reference image or reference imaging data.
22. The system of claim 17, wherein said processor is trained based on a reference set of image data from those effectively treated and those who failed treatment and using directed or undirected machine learning to obtain a classifier which identifies in new unknown samples who will effectively be treated in the future.
23. The system of claim 17, wherein the subject is selected by a statistical measure of the signature distribution of the signature scores.
24. The system of claim 23, wherein the subject is selected by Optical Prediction of Time Interval to Metastasis (OPTIM) as being in Q3 and/or Q4.
25. The system of claim 23 or 24, wherein commercial tests gain improved performance in predicting response to treatment based on the statistical measure.
26. The system of claim 25, wherein the commercial test is a 21 gene expression assay OncotypeDX test by Genomic Health or an equivalent genomic assay.
27. The system of any one of claims 17-26, wherein subjects with cancer are first
selected for evaluation by genomic assays including commercial tests including the 21 gene expression assay OncotypeDX by Genomic Health or equivalent genomic assays with a recurrence score below the threshold for treatment and the signature distribution of signature scores is used to find high risk of recurrence without treatment and/or those likely to benefit from treatment with a lower risk of recurrence.
28. The system of any one of claims 17-26, wherein subjects with cancer are first
selected by genomic assays including commercial tests including the 21 gene expression assay OncotypeDX by Genomic Health or equivalent genomic assays with a high recurrence score above the threshold for treatment and the signature distribution of signature scores is used to find low risk of recurrence without treatment and/or those most likely to benefit from treatment to prevent recurrence and/or if treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, pathological complete response (pCR) and/or response to treatment resulting in lower risk of recurrence.
