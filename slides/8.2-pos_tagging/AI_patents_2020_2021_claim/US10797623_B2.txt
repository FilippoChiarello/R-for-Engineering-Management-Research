<title>
Semiconductor device and method of detecting its rotation abnormality
</title>

<abstract>
The conventional semiconductor device requires use of a separate vibration sensor or the like to detect a rotation abnormality of a motor. According to an embodiment, a semiconductor device includes: a resolver rotation angle conversion circuit that obtains a rotation angle signal indicative of a rotation angle of the motor obtained from a resolver that measures the rotation angle of the motor and generates rotation angle information by converting the rotation angle signal to a digital value; a motor rotation angle conversion circuit that generates rotation angle temporal change information by converting the rotation angle information with respect to each phase of the motor to an angular change of the motor; and a determination circuit that determines that an abnormality occurs in the motor in a case of exceeding a fluctuation abnormality detection range of the rotation angle temporal change in the rotation angle temporal change information.
