COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED DETERMINATION OF A QUALITY INDICATOR OF A PRODUCTION BATCH-RUN OF A PRODUCTION PROCESS
</title>

<abstract>
To determine a quality indicator of production batch-run (220) of a production process (200), a computer (600) compares time-series with multi-source data from a reference batch-run (210) and time-series with multi-source data from the production batch-run (220). Before comparing, the computer converts multi-variate time-series to uni- variate time-series, by first multiplying data values of source-specific uni-variate time-series with source-specific factors from a conversion factor vector (610*) and second summing up the multiplied data values according to discrete time points. The source-specific factors of the conversion factor vector are obtained earlier by processing reference data, comprising the determination of characteristic portions of the time-series, converting, aligning by time-warping and evaluating displacement in time between characteristic portions before alignment and after alignment.
