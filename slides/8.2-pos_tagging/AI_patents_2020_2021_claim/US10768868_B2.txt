<title>
System and method for performing fault diagnosis on a device
</title>

<abstract>
In connection with an error event detected in an image forming apparatus, a fault diagnosis service server diagnoses the error event and obtains a diagnosis result for handling to be performed on the error event detected in the image forming apparatus. In a case where the diagnosis result indicates a plurality of candidates for handling to be performed on the error event, the fault diagnosis service server compares the plurality of candidates for handling to a result estimated by a diagnosis model with respect to the error event. In a case where the plurality of candidates for handling is different from the result estimated by the diagnosis model, the fault diagnosis service obtains partial operation information from a history of the image forming apparatus and executes machine relearning based on the obtained partial operation information with respect to a layer in a latter stage of a plurality of layers included in the diagnosis model, each layer performing a different estimation.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: a storage storing a model for estimating an appropriate handling for an error event detected in a network device, the model constructed by machine learning using operation information collected from the network device and a history of handlings for the network device; at least one memory storing instructions; and at least one processor which, when executing the instructions, causes the system to: obtain, based on the error event detected in the network device, a diagnosis result of diagnosis in the network device for identifying handling to be performed on the error event; in a case where the diagnosis result indicates a plurality of candidates for handling to be performed on the error event, compare each of the plurality of candidates for handling the error event, to a result estimated with respect to the error event using the model; and in a case where each of the plurality of candidates for handling the error event is found by the comparing to be different from the estimated result, obtain partial operation information from the history; and execute machine relearning based on the obtained partial operation information with respect to a layer in a latter stage in a plurality of layers included in the model, each layer performing a different estimation.
2. The system according to claim 1, wherein, in the history, the handling for the network device is associated with the operation information, and wherein the partial operation information to be used for the machine relearning is operation information associated with, in the history, a same handling for the network device as one of the plurality of candidates.
3. The system according to claim 1, wherein the machine relearning is executed with respect to a layer in a final stage in the plurality of layers.
4. The system according to claim 3, wherein a node of the layer in the final stage is associated with the plurality of candidates for handling, and a weight from a previous layer to the node of the layer in the final stage is adjusted in the machine relearning.
5. The system according to claim 1, wherein the handling represents a specific measure for a specific part in the network device or a specific operation for the network device.
6. The system according to claim 1, wherein a result having a highest probability or a result having a probability within a predetermined threshold value from the highest probability is regarded as an estimation result in estimation using the model.
7. A method performed in a system storing a model for estimating an appropriate handling for an error event detected in a network device, the appropriate handling estimated based on operation information collected from the network device and a history of handlings for the network device, the method comprising: obtaining, based on an error event detected in the network device, a diagnosis result of diagnosis in the network device for identifying handling to be performed on the error event; in a case where the diagnosis result indicates a plurality of candidates for handling to be performed on the error event, comparing each of the plurality of candidates for handling, to a result estimated with respect to the error event using the model; in a case where each of the plurality of candidates for handling the error event is found by the comparing to be different from the estimated result, obtaining partial operation information from the history; and executing machine relearning based on the obtained partial operation information with respect to a layer in a latter stage in a plurality of layers included in the model, each performing a different estimation.
8. A non-transitory computer readable storage medium on which is stored a computer program for causing a computer to execute a method for a system that stores a model for estimating an appropriate handling for an error event detected in a network device, the model constructed by machine learning using operation information collected from the network device and a history of handlings for the network device, the method comprising: obtaining, based on an error event detected in the network device, a diagnosis result of diagnosis in the network device for identifying handling to be performed on the error event; in a case where the diagnosis result indicates a plurality of candidates for handling to be performed on the error event, comparing each of the plurality of candidates for handling, to a result estimated with respect to the error event using the model; in a case where each of the plurality of candidates for handling the error event is found by the comparing to be different from the estimated result, obtaining partial operation information from the history; and executing machine relearning based on the obtained partial operation information with respect to a layer in a latter stage in a plurality of layers included in the model, each performing a different estimation.
