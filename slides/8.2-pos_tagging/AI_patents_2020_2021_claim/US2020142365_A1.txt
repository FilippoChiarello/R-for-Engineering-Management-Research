BUILDING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WITH DEVICE TWINNING, NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP), AND BLOCK CHAIN
</title>

<abstract>
A building management system includes one or more processing circuits. The one or more processing circuits are configured to receive, from a physical building device of a building, environmental inputs and environmental outputs of the physical building device; generate a building device digital twin for the physical building device based on the received environmental inputs and the received environmental outputs; generate a predicted future performance of the physical building device based on the building device digital twin; and generate a recommendation based on the predicted future performance of the physical building device, the recommendation indicating one or more changes to implement on the physical building device. The building device digital twin is a model for predicting the behavior of the physical building device ore changes to implement on the physical building device.
