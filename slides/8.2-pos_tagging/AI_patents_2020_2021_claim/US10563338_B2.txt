Personalized laundry appliance
</title>

<abstract>
Laundry appliances use machine learning models and/or personalization to provide better treatments. As one example, a laundry appliance has a chamber in which laundry items are placed for treatment. Sensor(s) are positioned to sense contents of the chamber or to sense the laundry items as they are loaded into the chamber. The machine learning model uses data from these sensors to determine various attributes of the laundry items and/or the treatment, such as the type of fabric and/or how dirty the items are, and the treatment process is controlled accordingly. Personalized data, such as an individual's preferences for laundry treatments or his sensitivities and allergies, may also be used to personalize the treatment process.

<claims>
1. A system for generating a setting for laundry appliance that treats a load of laundry items, the system comprising: a sensor group associated with the laundry appliance, the sensor group comprising one or more sensors that capture sensor data for one or more laundry items in the load, wherein the sensor group includes a tactile surface sensor that senses a surface of one or more laundry items through contact with the laundry item when the laundry item is pressed against the tactile surface sensor during loading of the laundry item into the laundry appliance, and wherein the tactile surface sensor is located on a front lip of the laundry appliance and the laundry item makes contact with and is sensed by the tactile surface sensor when moving across the front lip of the laundry appliance into a chamber of the laundry appliance; a machine learning model that receives the sensor data and determines, based on the sensor data, a treatment attribute related to the treatment of the load by the laundry appliance, wherein the sensor data includes surface characteristics of the laundry item captured by the tactile surface sensor; and a controller that generates a setting for the laundry appliance based on the treatment attribute determined by the machine learning model and controls the laundry appliance to treat the load according to the generated setting, wherein the laundry appliance is a dryer for drying laundry items, and the controller further obtains data from a washer that has previously treated the laundry items, including washing the laundry items, and the setting used by the dryer for drying the laundry items is generated further based on the data from the washer used to washing the laundry items.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model further receives personalized data for one or more individuals associated with the laundry items, and determines the treatment attribute further based on the personalized data.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model further receives history data associated with the laundry appliance and/or the laundry items, and determines the treatment attribute further based on the history data.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the sensor group includes a camera that captures images of one or more laundry items, and the machine learning model determines the treatment attribute based on the captured images.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the treatment attribute determined by the machine learning model includes one of fabric type, size of the laundry items, size of the load, and soiled level of the load.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model identifies one of the laundry items based on the sensor data, and the controller generates the setting based on the identified laundry item.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the setting for the laundry appliance is generated based in part on at least one of: treatment instructions for the identified laundry item, and prior treatments of the identified laundry item by the laundry appliance.
8. The system of claim 6, wherein the setting for the laundry appliance is generated based in part on an personalized preference for treating the identified laundry item.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model is implemented remotely from the laundry appliance.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the controller further obtains personalized data for one or more individuals associated with the laundry items, and the setting for the laundry appliance is generated further based on the individualized data.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the individual associated with the laundry items is a user of the laundry items and the personalized data includes one of: the user's sensitivities or allergies, the user's medical conditions, or the user's preferences for laundry treatments.
12. The system of claim 10, wherein the personalized data is obtained from the individual's profile accessible by the laundry appliance.
13. The system of claim 10, wherein the personalized data is obtained from a smart phone or other personal computing device operated by the individual.
14. The system of claim 10, wherein the personalized data is obtained from third party websites.
15. The system of claim 1, wherein the controller comprises a second machine learning model that generates the setting for the laundry appliance.
16. The system of claim 1, wherein the treatment attribute is personalized to an individual associated with the laundry items.
17. The system of claim 1, wherein the setting is personalized to an individual associated with the laundry items.
18. A method for generating a setting for laundry appliance that treats a load of laundry items, the method comprising: capturing sensor data for one or more laundry items in the load, wherein the sensor group includes a tactile surface sensor that senses a surface of one or more laundry items through contact with the laundry item when the laundry item is pressed against the tactile surface sensor during loading of the laundry item into the laundry appliance, and wherein the tactile surface sensor is located on a front lip of the laundry appliance and the laundry item makes contact with and is sensed by the tactile surface sensor when moving across the front lip of the laundry appliance into a chamber of the laundry appliance; applying the captured sensor data as input to a machine learning model that determines a treatment attribute related to the treatment of the load by the laundry appliance, wherein the sensor data includes surface characteristics of the laundry item captured by the tactile surface sensor; generating a setting for the laundry appliance based on the treatment attribute determined by the machine learning model; and causing the laundry appliance to treat the load according to the generated setting, wherein the laundry appliance is a dryer for drying laundry items, and the method further comprises obtaining data from a washer that has previously treated the laundry items, including washing the laundry items, and the setting used by the dryer for drying the laundry items is generated further based on the data from the washer used to washing the laundry items.
