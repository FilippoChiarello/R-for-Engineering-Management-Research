<title>
EMAIL-BASED AUTHENTICATION FOR ACCOUNT LOGIN, ACCOUNT CREATION AND SECURITY FOR PASSWORDLESS TRANSACTIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method is disclosed for providing vendors an alternative to a password-based security system. The system and method also allows vendors to manage secure transactions by leveraging various message authentication techniques while allowing the vendor full control over related processes such as payment processing and fulfillment. The system and method also monitors message requests from customers for the vendor to guarantee that the communication has not been compromised. Consolidating the authentication of users to their messaging minimizes the need for each individual vendor to maintain their own password for access to a customer account. This eliminates the requirement that customers generate a password thus increasing convenience and decreasing security risks associated with the use of passwords. This decreases risk not only for customer and vendor but also decreases the risk exposure across the internet-as the system scales.

<claims>
1. A method for improving security of a computer system utilizing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), the method comprising: receiving, by an e-commerce system, a SMTP email from a customer, wherein the SMTP email is generated by the customer selecting a mailto link; authenticating, by the e-commerce system, a sender of the SMTP email; validating, by the e-ecommerce system, the customer based on a unique identifier contained in the SMTP email; and on a condition that the sender of the SMTP email is authenticated and the unique identifier is validated: system, a vendor system to grant the customer access a secure webpage of the vendor system by transmitting the unique identifier from the vendor system.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the authenticating is performed using at least one of Domain Key Identified Mail (DKIM) authentication and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC).
3. (canceled)
4. (canceled)
5. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: verifying, by the e-commerce system, fidelity of a Domain Name System (DNS) record for the sender of the SMTP email; wherein the causing is performed on a condition that the sender of the SMTP email is authenticated, the unique identifier is validated and the fidelity of the DNS record for the Sender of the SMTP email is verified.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the verifying is performed using Sender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol.
7. (canceled)
8. The method according to claim 1, wherein the authenticating is performed by searching a blockchain ledger for the unique identifier.
9. The method according to claim 8, wherein the blockchain ledger is updated after the customer is authenticated.
10. The method according to claim 1, wherein the authenticating is performed by the e-commerce system: determining that a second authentication is required; transmitting a request for the second authentication to the customer; and receiving a response to the request for the second authentication from the customer.
11. The method according to claim 1, wherein the vendor system grants access to the secure webpage by sending a second SMTP email to the customer.
12. The method according to claim 1, wherein the vendor system allows the customer to access the secure webpage by establishing a secure channel between a device of the customer and the vendor system utilizing WebSockets.
13. A system for improving security of a computer system utilizing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), the system comprising: a communication interface that is communicatively coupled to a user device and a vendor system via a network; a memory; and a processor communicatively coupled to the communication interface and the memory; wherein the processor: receives, using the communication interface, a SMTP email from the user device, wherein the SMTP email is generated by a user selecting a mailto link, authenticates a sender of the of the SMTP email, validates the user based on a unique identifier contained in the SMTP email, and on a condition that the sender of the SMTP email is authenticated and the unique identifier is validated: causes, using the communication interface, a vendor system to grant the user access to a secure webpage of the vendor system by transmitting the unique identifier to the vendor system.
14. The system according to claim 13, wherein the processor authenticates the sender by performing at least one of Domain Key Identified Mail (DKIM) authentication and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC).
15. (canceled)
16. The system according to claim 13, wherein the processor is further configured to: verify fidelity of a Domain Name System (DNS) record for the sender of the SMTP email; and cause the vendor system to grant the user access to the secure webpage when the sender of the SMTP email is authenticated, the unique identifier is validated and the DNS record of the sender is verified.
17. The system according to claim 16, wherein the processor validates the DNS record using Sender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol.
18. (canceled)
19. The system according to claim 13, wherein the communication interface is further communicatively coupled to a blockchain ledger, and the processor authenticates, using the communication interface, the user by searching the blockchain ledger for the unique identifier.
20. The system according to claim 19, wherein the blockchain ledger is updated after the user is authenticated.
21. The system according to claim 13, wherein the processor authenticates the user by: determining that a second authentication is required; transmitting, using the communication interface, a request for the second authentication to the user device; and receiving, using the communication interface, a response to the request for the second authentication from the user device.
22. The system according to claim 13, wherein the vendor system: allows the user to access the secure webpage by establishing a secure channel between the user device and the vendor system utilizing WebSockets.
