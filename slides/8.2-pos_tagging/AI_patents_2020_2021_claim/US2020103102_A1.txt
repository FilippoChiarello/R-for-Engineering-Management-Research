<title>
Methods and Systems for an Automated Design, Fulfillment, Deployment and Operation Platform for Lighting Installations
</title>

<abstract>
A platform for design of a lighting installation generally includes an automated search engine for retrieving and storing a plurality of lighting objects in a lighting object library and a lighting design environment providing a visual representation of a lighting space containing lighting space objects and lighting objects. The visual representation is based on properties of the lighting space objects and lighting objects obtained from the lighting object library. A plurality of aesthetic filters is configured to permit a designer in a design environment to adjust parameters of the plurality of lighting objects handled in the design environment to provide a desired collective lighting effect using the plurality of lighting objects.

<claims>
1. 1-120. (canceled)
121. A near-field characterization system comprising: a light source positioning support adapted to hold a light source disposed to distribute light in a first orientation; an intermediate screen disposed to receive on a first side the distributed light, the intermediate screen constructed to transfer a portion of the received light to a second side that is substantially parallel to the first side; a two-dimensional array illumination sensor disposed to capture an image of the second side of the intermediate screen, the image including a data value representing illumination at each of a plurality of image sensing positions in the array; a processor adapted to control the illumination sensor and store the data value and the two-dimensional location of the corresponding image sensing position in the array; and a data storage facility that works with the processor to store the data value and its corresponding position for a plurality of image sensing positions in the array.
122. The system of claim 121, wherein to control the illumination sensor includes rotating the illumination sensor.
123. The system of claim 121, wherein the two-dimensional array illumination sensor includes a digital camera.
124. The system of claim 123, wherein the digital camera is a camera function of a smartphone.
125. The system of claim 121, wherein the intermediate screen is translucent.
126. The system of claim 121, further comprising a positioning system of the intermediate screen controlled by the processor to adjust a distance between the light source and the intermediate screen.
127. The system of claim 121, further comprising a positioning system of the light source controlled by the processor to adjust a distance between the light source and the intermediate screen.
128. The system of claim 121, wherein the light source positioning support facilitates rotational and translational motion of the light source.
129. The system of claim 121, wherein the processor is further adapted to control at least one of position, rotation, and translational motion of the light source.
130. The system of claim 121, further comprising a housing that mitigates the impact of ambient light on the intermediate screen and the area array illumination sensor.
131. 131-427. (canceled)
