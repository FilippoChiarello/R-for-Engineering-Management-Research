<abstract>
A method that incorporates teachings of the subject disclosure may include, for example, determining, by a system comprising a processor, more common features of a plurality of images according to similarity matrices indicating relative similarities between instances of common features occurring within multiple images of the plurality of images, defining, by the system, cluster groups associated with the more common features, where each cluster group comprises cluster images of the plurality of images, and where the more common features are present in each the cluster images, and performing, by the system, quality-based filtering on the cluster images to identify a target cluster image to represent the cluster images for each of the cluster groups. Other embodiments are disclosed.
