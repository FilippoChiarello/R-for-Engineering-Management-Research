</title>

<abstract>
Technology disclosed herein may involve a computing system that (i) based on an image of a target object of a given class of object and at least one GAN configured to generate artificial images of the given class of object, generates an artificial image of the target object that is substantially similar to real-world images of objects of the given class of objects captured by real-world scanning devices, (ii) based on an image of a receptacle, selects an insertion location within the receptacle in the image of the receptacle to insert the artificial image of the target object, (iii) generates a combined image of the receptacle and the target object, wherein generating the combined image comprises inserting the artificial image of the target object into the image of the receptacle at the insertion location, and (iv) trains one or more object detection algorithms with the combined image of the receptacle and the target object.
