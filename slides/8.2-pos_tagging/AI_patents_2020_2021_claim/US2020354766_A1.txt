</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method to identify microorganisms in a biological sample, using an infrared spectroscope with attenuated total reflectance comprising: a step of preparing a database of reference spectra associated with known samples of species, subspecies and sub-classifications of known microorganisms; one or more steps of creating pre-calculated models, starting from said database, based on identification spectral characteristics most significant for each species, subspecies or sub-classification of known microorganisms; a step of sampling an unknown sample, obtained from growth on solid or liquid media, possibly with biological fluids; one or more steps of acquiring the spectrum of the unknown sample; one or more steps of processing the spectrum of the unknown sample; one or more steps of analyzing the spectrum of the unknown sample, by comparing it with the pre-calculated models, each of which provides at least some belonging scores of the unknown sample to one or more of said species, subspecies or sub-classifications of known microorganisms and a parameter of the reliability of said belonging scores; one or more control steps in which, starting from said belonging scores and from said reliability parameter, a new acquisition step of the spectrum of the unknown sample is requested, or a final result of the method is provided, which can comprise a failed identification, or a successful identification.
2. The method as in claim 1, wherein the steps of preparing a database of reference spectrums associated with known sample species, subspecies or sub-classification of known microorganisms provides, for each known sample: a step of sampling the known sample obtained by growth on solid or liquid media in the presence or absence of biological fluids; one or more steps of acquiring the spectrum of the known sample; one or more steps of processing the spectrum of the known sample.
3. The method as in claim 1, wherein the reference spectra comprise spectra associated with samples of different species, subspecies or sub-classifications of microorganisms and/or of different strains of the same species, subspecies or sub-classifications of microorganisms and/or grown on variable culture media, with or without biological fluids.
4. The method as in claim 1, wherein the unknown sample is grown on a solid culture medium.
5. The method as in claim 1, wherein at least one of the known samples is grown on a solid culture medium.
6. The method as in claim 1, wherein the unknown sample is grown in at least one growth liquid broth, subsequently centrifuged or filtered or enriched to obtain a pellet or a concentrated sample, and in that the spectrum is acquired by removing assays from said pellet or concentrated sample.
7. The method as in claim 1, wherein at least one of the known samples is grown in at least one growth liquid broth, subsequently centrifuged or filtered or enriched to obtain a pellet or a concentrated sample, and in that the spectrum is acquired by removing assays from said pellet or concentrated sample.
8. The method as in claim 1, wherein the processing step provides to use algorithms which automatically identify the most significant identification spectral characteristics of the samples in spectral ranges defined in advance.
9. The method as in claim 1, wherein the analysis step provides to use statistical methods such as multivariate analysis.
10. The method as in claim 1, wherein the analysis step provides to use methods based on the analysis of the principal components.
11. The method as in claim 1, wherein the analysis step provides to use methods based on neural networks.
12. The method as in claim 1, wherein the analysis step provides to use methods based on the analysis of clusters of spectra.
13. The method as in claim 1, wherein said pre-calculated models comprise a list of said identification spectral characteristics for each sample, both unknown and known.
14. The method as in claim 1, wherein the acquisition steps provide spectroscopic monitoring of the drying level of the sample, so that the spectrum is acquired only when a predetermined standard level of drying is reached.
15. An apparatus to carry out the method to identify microorganisms in a biological sample as in claim 1, comprising a spectrophotometer for FTIR spectroscopy in ATR acquisition mode, coupled with a processing system and a data display system installed in a computer, a source of infrared radiation, reflecting elements, an internal reflection element, such as a crystal, and a detector, an acquisition zone being defined on the surface of said crystal on which the biological sample to be analyzed is positioned, wherein in said computer said pre-calculated models associated with known samples of species, subspecies and sub-classifications of known microorganisms are memorized.
