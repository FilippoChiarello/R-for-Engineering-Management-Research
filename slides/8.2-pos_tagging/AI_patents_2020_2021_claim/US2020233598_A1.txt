AUTOMATED STORAGE TIERING BY ACCESS PATTERN DETECTION AND TEMPORAL TREND PREDICTION
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for data storage optimization processing that may include: receiving I/O access information characterizing observed I/O operations directed to a logical address space; analyzing the I/O access information to identify a predicted I/O access distribution expected for the plurality of logical regions of the logical address space at multiple points in time; determining a placement plan specifying placement of data portions of the plurality of logical regions among a plurality of storage tiers; and performing, in accordance with the placement plan, at least one data movement that moves at least a first data portion of a first of the plurality of logical regions from a first of the plurality of storage tiers to a second of the plurality of storage tiers.
