E-CIGARETTE SYSTEM AND METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An e-cigarette system includes (a) a user-replaceable 10mL e-liquid reservoir for dispensing e-liquid and (b) a desktop e-cigarette electrical charging and liquid re-filling device (100) configured to receive the tip or mouthpiece (32) of an e-cigarette (1). The desktop charging and re-filling device includes an electrical or electronic fluid transfer system, configured to transfer e-liquid from the e-liquid reservoir. The user-replaceable 10mL e-liquid reservoir is inserted into the desktop charging and re-filling device and engages with the electrical or electronic fluid transfer system in the charging and filling device. It is not user-refillable and is therefore a closed system.

<claims>
1. An e-cigarette system including (a) a user-replaceable e-liquid reservoir (3) for dispensing e-liquid and (b) an e-cigarette electrical charging and liquid re-filling device (100) configured to receive the tip or mouthpiece (32) of an e-cigarette (1);
in which the charging and re-filling device (100) includes or encases: an electrical or electronic fluid transfer system (4), being configured to transfer e-liquid from the e-liquid reservoir (3) directly into the tip or mouthpiece (32));
and in which the user-replaceable e-liquid reservoir (3) is (i) inserted into, or otherwise attached to, the charging and re-filling device (100) and (ii) engages with the electrical or electronic fluid transfer system (4) in the charging and re-filling device (100) and (iii) is not user-refillable.
2. The e-cigarette system of Claim 1, in which the charging and re-filling device is configured to automatically transfer e-liquid from the user-replaceable reservoir to an atomizing unit in the tip or mouthpiece (32) using the fluid transfer system.
3. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which the fluid transfer system is a piston pump .
4. The e-cigarette system of preceding Claim 3 in which the fluid transfer system is a linear travel piston pump.
5. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which the reservoir includes an electronic identifier, such as a unique identification chip.
6. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which the e-cigarette includes indicators that show when e-liquid equivalent to a single cigarette is present in the e-cigarette and when that e-liquid equivalent to a single cigarette has been consumed.
7. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which the reservoir stores a record of the amount of e-liquid pumped from it.
8. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which the charging and re-filling device displays the amount of e-liquid left in the reservoir.
9. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which the system sends or transmits e-liquid consumption data, either wirelessly or with a wired connection.
10. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which the system sends or transmits consumption data, either wirelessly or with a wired connection, that shows how consumption varies according to various parameters, such as part of the day/night, daily, weekly, seasonal, weather, time, location, temperature and any other factor.
11. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which the system is configured to implement a nicotine reduction or cessation program, the system including a counter/measuring system for counting or measuring e-liquid consumption.
12. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which the device is configured to enable automated re-ordering of fresh reservoirs.
13. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which the device detects or measures or infers the amount of e-liquid in the reservoir and prompts the user for a new reservoir when the amount falls below a set threshold.
14. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which the device is configured to automatically send a signal requesting a replacement for the user-replaceable e-liquid reservoir to an e-fulfilment platform, either directly or via a connected smartphone.
15. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim and in which the reservoir stores no more than 10mL of e-liquid.
16. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which the system is lockable to prevent use by unauthorized persons, including under-age persons.
17. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which the charging and re-filling device is a desktop station.
18. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which the charging and re-filling device is a desktop station that is plugged into a power socket.
19. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which the tip or mouthpiece is oriented, during filling, with the end of the tip oriented downwards.
20. The e-cigarette system of preceding Claim 19 in which a refill nozzle in the refilling device enters the tip or mouthpiece part of the e-cigarette, opening a valve in the tip or mouthpiece, through which e-liquid can flow.
21. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which several user-replaceable e-liquid reservoirs are inserted into, or otherwise attached to, the charging and re-filling device (100) and engage with the electrical or electronic fluid transfer system.
22. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim in which several user-replaceable e-liquid reservoirs are inserted into, or otherwise attached to, the charging and re-filling device (100) and the device is operable to select a specific desired reservoir or to mix e-liquid from several cartridges.
23. The e-cigarette system of Claim 21 or 22 in which different reservoirs include e-liquid of different nicotine strength, or flavor, or include no nicotine.
24. The e-cigarette system of any preceding Claim 21 - 23 which is configured to enable a user to enter a desired mix of e-liquids from different reservoirs by interacting with an application on a smartphone or with a touch screen on the refilling device.
25. A user-replaceable e-liquid reservoir for dispensing e-liquid, when configured to be the e-liquid reservoir defined in any preceding claim.
26. A method of re-filling an e-cigarette system including (a) a non user-refillable, but user-replaceable, e-liquid reservoir (3) for dispensing e-liquid and (b) an e-cigarette electrical charging and liquid re-filling device (100) configured to receive the tip or mouthpiece (32) of an e-cigarette (1); including the steps of: (i) inserting, or otherwise attaching, the user-replaceable e-liquid reservoir (3) to the e-cigarette charging and re-filling device (100); (ii) engaging the e-liquid reservoir (3) with an electrical or electronic pump (4) fluid transfer system in the charging and re-filling device (100); (iii) transferring e-liquid under pressure from the e-liquid reservoir (3) directly into the tip or mouthpiece (32).
