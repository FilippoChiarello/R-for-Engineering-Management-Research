Golf equipment identification and fitting system
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for identifying golf equipment. The system may include one or more performance tracking devices, such as an optical sensor system or a radar sensor system for tracking at least one of a golf club swing or a golf ball flight. The system also may include at least one processor and memory storing instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the system to perform a set of operations. The operations include receiving current dynamic input for a golf shot from a golfer and current static input for the golfer. The operations also include executing a trained machine-learning model based on the received current dynamic input and current static input to generate predicted golf club properties and/or predicted golf ball properties for the golfer. The predicted golf club properties and/or predicted golf ball properties are displayed on a connected display.
