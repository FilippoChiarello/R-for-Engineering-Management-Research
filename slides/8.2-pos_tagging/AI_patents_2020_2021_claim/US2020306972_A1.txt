ROBOT CONTROL SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A robot control system includes a control device for controlling a robot and a portable operating panel connected to the control device. The portable operating panel and at least one other device include contact points connected in series. The control device includes a reception circuit that can detect the opening of at least one of the contact points. The portable operating panel includes a smart device having a sensor. The contact point included in the portable operating panel is opened and closed in conjunction with a physical movement of a switch member attached to an exterior of the smart device. The sensor can detect a physical quantity that changes in conjunction with the physical movement of the switch member. The portable operating panel transmits, to the control device, a detection signal indicating the physical quantity detected by the sensor or information about the physical quantity.

<claims>
1. A robot control system comprising: a control device for controlling a robot; and a portable operating panel connected to the control device, wherein the portable operating panel and at least one other device include respective contact points connected in series, the control device includes a reception circuit that can detect an opening of at least one of the contact points, the portable operating panel includes a smart device having a sensor, the contact point included in the portable operating panel is opened and closed in conjunction with a physical movement of a switch member attached to an exterior of the smart device, the sensor can detect a physical quantity that changes in conjunction with the physical movement of the switch member, and the portable operating panel transmits, to the control device, a detection signal indicating the physical quantity detected by the sensor or information about the physical quantity.
2. The robot control system according to claim 1, further comprising: a determination unit that can communicate with the control device, wherein the determination unit determines that the contact point included in the portable operating panel is opened on a basis of the detection signal transmitted from the portable operating panel and the opening of the at least one of the contact points detected by the reception circuit.
3. The robot control system according to claim 1, further comprising: a determination unit that can communicate with the control device, wherein the determination unit determines that the contact point included in the portable operating panel is closed on a basis of the detection signal transmitted from the portable operating panel and a contact of the contact points detected by the reception circuit.
4. The robot control system according to claim 1, wherein the physical quantity includes an acceleration of the smart device, and the sensor includes an acceleration sensor for detecting the acceleration.
5. The robot control system according to claim 1, wherein the physical quantity includes a distance between the switch member and a prescribed region of the smart device, and the sensor includes a touch panel sensor or a proximity sensor for detecting that a material is in contact with or is close to the prescribed region of the smart device.
6. The robot control system according to claim 1, wherein the physical quantity includes an amount of light radiated on a prescribed region of the smart device, and the sensor includes a light amount sensor for detecting the amount of light.
7. The robot control system according to claim 1, wherein the physical quantity includes image data that can be converted into image information, such as visible light, radiated on a prescribed region of the smart device, and the sensor includes a camera for acquiring the image data.
8. The robot control system according to claim 2, wherein the determination unit includes a machine learning unit for performing supervised learning, wherein the machine learning unit includes a state observation unit for observing a state variable including the detection signal of the sensor, a learning unit that acquires teaching data including information generated when the contact point is opened or closed due to a physical movement of the switch member and that updates, on a basis of the teaching data, a learning model for determining whether or not the contact point has been opened or closed due to the physical movement of the switch member, and a decision-making unit that acquires the detection signal of the sensor and that determines, on a basis of the current detection signal of the sensor and the learning model, whether or not the contact point has been opened or closed due to the physical movement of the switch member.
9. The robot control system according to claim 3, wherein the determination unit includes a machine learning unit for performing supervised learning, wherein the machine learning unit includes a state observation unit for observing a state variable including the detection signal of the sensor, a learning unit that acquires teaching data including information generated when the contact point is opened or closed due to a physical movement of the switch member and that updates, on a basis of the teaching data, a learning model for determining whether or not the contact point has been opened or closed due to the physical movement of the switch member, and a decision-making unit that acquires the detection signal of the sensor and that determines, on a basis of the current detection signal of the sensor and the learning model, whether or not the contact point has been opened or closed due to the physical movement of the switch member.
10. The robot control system according to claim 2, wherein the determination unit is included in a device connected to the control device via a network.
