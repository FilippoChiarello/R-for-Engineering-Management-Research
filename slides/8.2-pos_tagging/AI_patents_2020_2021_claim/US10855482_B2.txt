<title>
Automated methods and apparatus for facilitating the design and deployment of monitoring systems
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and apparatus for automating various aspects relating to the design and/or deployment of monitoring systems, e.g., systems which can monitor for fire, break-ins and/or other conditions are described. In various embodiments a customer provides location and customer premises layout information as well as an indication of what is to be monitored. A rules database is accessed and a plan that is compliant with local rules is automatically generated. A user is walked through deployment of components, e.g., on his cell phone or other handheld communications device, in an easy to follow manner with monitoring device position, wireless communications ability, and function being checked automatically as part of the process as each sensor is deployed. If wireless connectivity is a problem suggestions are presented to the user for moving a sensor, e.g., camera. At the end of the process the system is activated and monitoring of the premises initiated.
