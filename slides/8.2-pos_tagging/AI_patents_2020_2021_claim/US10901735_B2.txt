<title>
Apparatus and method to improve performance of memory accesses from plural arithmetic processors
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus includes a memory, a memory controller, arithmetic processors, and access circuits corresponding to the arithmetic processors. The memory controller controls a load instruction that reads, from the memory, data to be obtained by the arithmetic processors. The access circuit generates divided instructions by dividing a multicast load instruction, and selects, for each divided instruction, a first access circuit that issues, to the memory controller, a read request for causing the target access circuits to perform responses to the target access arithmetic processors. The first access circuit determines first identification information common to all the target access circuits, and issues, to the memory controller, a single read request to which the first identification information is added, and obtains, from the memory controller, responses to which the first identification information is added, and outputs first data based on the obtained responses to the target arithmetic processors.
