<title>
SMART ROAD SENSOR
</title>

<abstract>
A road sensor has a housing, at least one sensor inside the housing, a processor inside the housing, the processor configured to execute instructions to cause the processor to: receive data from the at least one sensor; use machine learning to recognize conditions local to the sensor from the sensor data; and provide an output signal of the conditions. A method of providing road conditions includes receiving, at a road sensor, input detectable by at least one sensor, using a processor in the road sensor to execute code that will cause the processor to: receive sensor data from the at least one sensor; apply machine learning to the sensor data to recognize at least one road condition associated with the sensor data; and transmit an output signal identifying the road conditions.

<claims>
1. A road sensor, comprising: a housing; at least one sensor inside the housing; a processor inside the housing, the processor configured to execute instructions to cause the processor to: receive data from the at least one sensor; use machine learning to recognize conditions local to the sensor from the sensor data; and provide an output signal of the conditions.
2. The road sensor as claimed in claim 1, wherein the housing further includes at least one reflector.
3. The road sensor as claimed in claim 2, wherein the at least one reflector includes at least one reflector having a window.
4. The road sensor as claimed in claim 3, wherein the road sensor includes a light emitting diode.
5. The road sensor as claimed in claim 3, wherein the road sensor includes a light pipe positioned to pass light from the light emitting diode to the window.
6. The road sensor as claimed in claim 1, wherein the road sensor includes an access port positioned to allow access to an inside of the housing when the road sensor is installed.
7. The road sensor as claimed in claim 1, wherein the road sensor includes a battery.
8. The road sensor as claimed in claim 5, wherein the road sensor includes a photovoltaic cell electrically connected to the battery to provide charge to the battery.
9. The road sensor as claimed in claim 1, wherein the at least one sensor includes at least one selected from the group consisting of: an accelerometer; a strain gauge; velocity sensor; a gyroscope; a pressure sensor; a vibration meter; an inertial measurement unit; a microphone; optical sensors; infrared sensors; charge-coupled devices (CCD); CMOS image sensors; UV sensors; distance and ranging sensors; ultrasonic sensors; light detection and ranging (LIDAR); radar; and radio frequency transceivers.
10. A method of providing road conditions, comprising: receiving, at a road sensor, input detectable by at least one sensor; using a processor in the road sensor to execute code that will cause the processor to: receive sensor data from the at least one sensor; apply machine learning to the sensor data to recognize at least one road condition associated with the sensor data; and transmit an output signal identifying the road conditions.
11. The method as claimed in claim 10, wherein the processor further executes instructions that cause the road sensor to operate locally.
12. The method as claimed in claim 10, wherein the processor further executes instructions that cause the road sensor to operate in a connected mode.
13. The method as claimed in claim 12, wherein the instructions that cause the road sensor to operate in a connected mode cause the processor to connect to a network through an access point.
14. The method as claimed in claim 13, wherein the instructions that cause the road sensor to operate in a connected mode cause the processor to connect to a network through an access point cause the processor to connect to an Internet Protocol network.
15. The method as claimed in claim 13, wherein the instructions that cause the road sensor to operate in a connected mode cause the processor to connect to a network through an access point cause the processor to connect to a cellular network.
16. The method as claimed in claim 10, further comprising providing an update to the processor by one of: replacing the processor; using a local communications link to update the processor; or using a network connection to update the processor.
17. The method as claimed in claim 10, further comprising providing an update to the network of sensor data not already classifiable by the locally processed code.
18. The method as claimed in claim 17 wherein providing an update further comprises using a local communications link to update the network.
19. The method as claimed in claim 17, wherein providing an update further comprises using a network connection to update the network.
