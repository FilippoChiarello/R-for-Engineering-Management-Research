Devices, systems, and methods for learning and using artificially intelligent interactive memories
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the disclosure generally relate to computing devices and may be generally directed to devices, systems, methods, and/or applications for learning conversations among two or more conversation participants, storing this knowledge in a knowledgebase (i.e. neural network, graph, sequences, etc.), and enabling a user to simulate a conversation with an artificially intelligent conversation participant.
