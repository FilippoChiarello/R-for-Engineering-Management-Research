<title>
Neural network computing systems for predicting vehicle requests
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments are described for minimizing a wait time for a rider after sending a ride request for a vehicle. An example computer-implemented method includes receiving a ride request, the request being for travel from a starting location to a zone in a geographic region during a specified timeslot. The method further includes predicting travel demand based on a number of ride requests in the zone during the specified timeslot. The method further includes requesting transport of one or more vehicles to the zone in response to the predicted number of ride requests when the travel demand is predicted to exceed a number of vehicles in the zone during the specified timeslot.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for processing travel requests, the method comprising: receiving a ride request, the request being for travel from a starting location to a zone in a geographic region during a specified timeslot; predicting travel demand based on a number of ride requests to the zone during the specified timeslot, wherein the travel demand is predicted based on a combination of a first prediction from a convolutional neural network (CNN) generated using a first input, and a second prediction from a recurrent neural network (RNN) generated using a second input, the combination of predictions being an average of the first prediction and the second prediction, and wherein the first input comprises travel analysis zone (TAZ) timeslot-cubes, and the second input comprises travel analysis zone (TAZ) factor-cubes; and requesting transport of one or more vehicles to the zone in response to the predicted number of ride requests when the travel demand is predicted to exceed a number of vehicles in the zone during the specified timeslot; wherein: the 3D CNN is trained using travel analysis zone (TAZ) timeslot-cubes, wherein a TAZ timeslot cube includes a plurality of matrices, each matrix associated with a predetermined factor, and wherein a first matrix associated with a first predetermined factor includes values of the first predetermined factor for each of the timeslots at each zone of the geographic region; and the recurrent neural network (RNN) is trained using travel analysis zone (TAZ) factor-cubes, wherein a TAZ factor-cube includes a plurality of matrices, and wherein a matrix includes values of a corresponding traffic parameter at each zone during a specific timeslot.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein said predicting travel demand further comprises: training the convolutional neural network and the recurrent neural network to predict travel demand in response to said receiving the request.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the convolutional neural network (CNN) is operably coupled to one or more travel analysis zone (TAZ) timeslot-cubes, wherein the training further comprises: building said one or more TAZ timeslot-cubes.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the CNN is a 2D CNN, and wherein the method further comprises, generating, by the forecasting server, the travel demand prediction by combining a third prediction by a 3D CNN, and a combined prediction by the combination of the 2D CNN and the RNN.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein transporting the one or more vehicles comprises transporting an autonomous vehicle by sending the autonomous vehicle an identifier of the zone.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein transporting the one or more vehicles comprises sending a request to a driver device to transport a vehicle to the zone by sending the driver device an identifier of the zone.
