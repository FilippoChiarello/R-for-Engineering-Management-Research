a vitrectomy probe with a first chamber and a second chamber on respective sides of a pneumatically driven diaphragm for reciprocating a probe cutter;
a pressurized gas source;
a valve coupled with the pressurized gas source, the valve having a solenoid which, when supplied with a current, moves a solenoid plunger to alternatively deliver and vent pressurized gas through a first outlet line and a second outlet line which respectively deliver and vent pressurized gas to and from the first chamber and to and from the second chamber of the vitrectomy probe;
a power supply coupled with the solenoid of the valve for supplying a voltage to drive a current in the solenoid;
a current sensor coupled to the solenoid and configured to monitor current in the solenoid and transmit a current signal;
a system controller coupled with the power supply and the current sensor, the system controller including a processor and a non-transitory computer readable medium containing instructions which, when executed by the processor, cause the system controller to:
receive the current signal from the current sensor;
identify when a plunger movement in the solenoid creates a back electromotive force (back EMF) that changes the current in the solenoid in a predetermined degree; and
cause the power supply, after detecting the back EMF, to enter a pulse width modulation (PWM) mode of operation to cause a continued movement of the solenoid plunger and/or hold an end position of the solenoid plunger until power to the solenoid is turned off at a predetermined timing.
