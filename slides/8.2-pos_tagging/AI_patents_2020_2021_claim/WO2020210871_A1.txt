CHEMICAL IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a chemical identification apparatus, comprising: an optical component having a magnification factor, for obtaining a magnified image of a sample; an image acquisition means to acquire an image data from the magnified 5 image; and an image processing module which is adapted to receive the image data, to determine whether at least one of one or more molecular level target signatures is present in the image data.

<claims>
THE CLAIMS DEFINING THE INVENTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1. A chemical identification apparatus, comprising
an optical component having a magnification factor, for obtaining a magnified image of a sample;
an image acquisition means to acquire an image data from the magnified image;
an image processing module which is adapted to receive the image data, to determine whether at least one of one or more molecular level target signatures is present in the image data.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein each target signature is a molecular signature, a morphological signature, a spectral signature, or a combination thereof.
3. The apparatus of claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising a light source which is adapted to illuminate the sample, at the time of image acquisition.
4. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the light source has a setting which is chosen to enhance said one or more target signatures.
5. The apparatus of claim 3 or claim 4, wherein the light source includes one or more lighting components.
6. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein the lighting components include components which generate lights of different wavelengths.
7. The apparatus of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the image processing module comprises an image detection module which is trained to detect the one or more target signatures.
8. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein the image processing module comprises a pre-processing module, which pre-processes the image data, and provides the pre-processed data to the image detection module.
9. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein pre-processing module includes one or more pre-processing functions chosen to enhance a possibility of detecting whether the one or more target signatures is present in the image data.
10. The apparatus of any one of the preceding claims, wherein said optical component is a microscope.
11. The apparatus of any one of the preceding claims, comprising a controller which includes said image processing module.
12. The apparatus of claim 11, wherein said controller is a processing unit of a computing device.
13. The apparatus of claim 12, wherein said computing device is a mobile device.
14. The apparatus of claim 13, wherein said optical component is retrofitted to said mobile device.
15. A method of training an image recognition system with a machine learning algorithm, including providing a plurality of training images to the image recognition system, the training images being magnified images acquired from samples containing a substance having a molecular level signature, being a molecular, morphological, or spectral signature, or a combination thereof.
16. The method of claim 15, including illuminating the samples at the time of image acquisition.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the illumination provided has a setting which is chosen to enhance the signature of the substance.
18. The method of claim 16 or claim 17, wherein at least some of the training images are acquired under an illumination setting which is different than the other ones of the training images.
19. The method of any one of claims 15 to 17, including annotating each training image to identify portion or portions therein containing the signature.
20. The method of any one of claims 15 to 19, wherein the training images include at least one set of training images, each set being taken of samples known to contain a respective sub-type of the substance, each respective sub-type having its own molecular level signature.
21. The method of any one of claims 15 to 20, further including providing negative examples to the image recognition system, the negative examples being at least one set of magnified images taken of samples known to not contain the substance.
22. The method of claim 21, wherein the negative examples include at least one set of magnified images taken of samples known to contain a material having a signature which resembles the signature of the substance.
23. The method of any one of claims 15 to 22, including pre-processing training images before inputting the training images to the image recognition system.
24. The method of claim 23, wherein a pre-processing function is chosen on the basis of the signature, to enhance the signature.
25. A method of chemical identification or detection, including acquiring an image data of a sample using an apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 14.
26. A method as claimed in claim 25, including providing the image data to an image detection system which is trained using the method of any one of claims 15 to 24.
27. An application for chemical identification or detection, including an image processing module, the image processing module including an image detection program which is trained using the method claimed in any one of claims 15 to 24.
28. The application of claim 27, including a control module for a device for controlling an image acquisition device.
29. The application of claim 27 or claim 28, including a control module for a light source.
30. The application of any one of claims 27 to 29, including a user interface module for user to input control commands.
31. The application of any one of claims 27 to 30, including an executable program which when executed is adapted to cause a display of or associated with a computing device on which the mobile application resides, to display an output.
32. The application of claim 31, the output being an image which is processed by the image processing module, further annotated to indicate location or locations of identified chemicals.
33. A computer programme, comprising instructions for controlling a computing device to implement the application as claimed in any one of claims 27 to 32.
34. A computer readable medium, providing a computer programme in accordance with claim 33.
