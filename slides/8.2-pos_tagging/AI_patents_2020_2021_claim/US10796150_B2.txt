<title>
Automated diagnosis and treatment of crop infestations
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are various embodiments for automating the diagnosis of crop infestations and estimating crop yields. In some embodiments, a field report that includes an image of a crop and a location of a corresponding field is received from a computing device. The image of the crop is processed using computer-vision techniques to identify a pathogen affecting the crop. A biocide to apply to the crop to treat the pathogen is then identified. In some embodiments, the yield of the crop can also be estimated. In such embodiments, a field report that includes images of plants in a field and an identifier of the field is received. A computer-vision technique is applied to each image to determine an individual yield of each plant in an image. An estimate of the yield of the crop is then calculated based on the individual yields of the plants and the size of the field.

<claims>
Therefore, the following is claimed:
1. A system, comprising: a first computing device comprising a processor and a memory; and machine readable instructions stored in the memory that, when executed by the processor, cause the first computing device to at least: receive a field report from a second computing device, the field report comprising a plurality of images of a corresponding plurality of plants in a crop and an identifier of a respective field; apply a first object-recognition technique to each image in the plurality of images to determine a type of the crop; select a second object-recognition technique based on the type of the crop; apply the second object-recognition technique each image in the plurality of images to determine the individual yield for each of the corresponding plants in the crop; determine a size of a corresponding field based on the identifier of the respective field; and calculate an estimated crop yield based at least in part on the individual yield for each of the corresponding plants in the crop and the size of the respective field.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the estimated crop yield is further based at least in part on planting data associated with the respective field.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the second computing device comprises a wearable computing device.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the second computing device comprises a mobile computing device.
5. A non-transitory, computer-readable medium comprising machine-readable instructions that, when executed by a processor of a first computing device, cause the first computing device to at least: receive a field report from a second computing device, the field report comprising a plurality of images of a corresponding plurality of plants in a crop and an identifier of a respective field; apply a first object-recognition technique to each image in the plurality of images to determine a type of the crop; select a second object-recognition technique based on the type of the crop; apply the second object-recognition technique each image in the plurality of images to determine the individual yield for each of the corresponding plants in the crop; determine a size of a corresponding field based on the identifier of the respective field; and calculate an estimated crop yield based at least in part on the individual yield for each of the corresponding plants in the crop and the size of the respective field.
6. The non-transitory, computer-readable medium comprising machine-readable of claim 5, wherein the estimated crop yield is further based at least in part on planting data associated with the respective field.
7. The non-transitory, computer-readable medium comprising machine-readable of claim 5, wherein the second computing device comprises a wearable computing device.
8. The non-transitory, computer-readable medium comprising machine-readable of claim 5, wherein the second computing device comprises a mobile computing device.
9. A method, comprising: receiving, with a first computing device, a field report from a second computing device, the field report comprising a plurality of images of a corresponding plurality of plants in a crop and an identifier of a respective field; applying, with the first computing device, a first object-recognition technique to each image in the plurality of images to determine a type of the crop; selecting, with the first computing device a second object-recognition technique based on the type of the crop; applying, with the first computing device, the second object-recognition technique each image in the plurality of images to determine the individual yield for each of the corresponding plants in the crop; determining, with the first computing device, a size of a corresponding field based on the identifier of the respective field; and calculating, with the first computing device, an estimated crop yield based at least in part on the individual yield for each of the corresponding plants in the crop and the size of the respective field.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the estimated crop yield is further based at least in part on planting data associated with the respective field.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the second computing device comprises a wearable computing device.
12. The method of claim 9, wherein the second computing device comprises a mobile computing device.
