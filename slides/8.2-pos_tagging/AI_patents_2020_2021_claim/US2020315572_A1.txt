<title>
IMAGE-BASED PROBE POSITIONING
</title>

<abstract>
A framework for image-based probe positioning is disclosed herein. The framework receives a current image from a probe. The current image is acquired by the probe within a structure of interest. The framework predicts a position of the probe and generates a recommendation of a next maneuver to be performed using the probe by applying the current image to a trained classifier. The framework then outputs the predicted position and the recommendation of the next maneuver.

<claims>
1. One or more non-transitory computer-readable media embodying instructions executable by machine to perform operations for intracardiac catheter positioning, comprising: (i) receiving a current intracardiac echocardiogram (ICE) image acquired by a catheter inserted into a heart; (ii) predicting a position of the catheter and generating a recommendation of a next maneuver to be performed using the catheter by applying the current ICE image to a trained classifier; and (iii) outputting the predicted position and the recommendation of the next maneuver.
2. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 1 wherein outputting the predicted position comprises displaying the catheter at the predicted position in a graphical representation of the heart.
3. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 1 wherein the operations further comprise training the classifier based on multiple ICE training images and using a mapping between the ICE training images and ICE catheter positions from which the ICE training images were acquired as ground truth.
4. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 1 wherein the next maneuver is represented by navigational instructions.
5. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 4 wherein the navigational instructions comprise machine instructions that are executable by a robotic controller to automatically steer the catheter to a desired position.
6. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable media of claim 1 wherein predicting the position of the catheter comprises further applying a time history of position predictions to the trained classifier to correct any error in the predicted position.
7. A method of probe positioning, comprising: (i) receiving a current image acquired by a probe within a structure of interest; (ii) predicting a position of the probe and generating a recommendation of a next maneuver to be performed using the probe by applying the current image to a trained classifier; and (iii) outputting the predicted position and the recommendation of the next maneuver.
8. The method of claim 7 wherein the training images and the current image comprise intracardiac echocardiogram (ICE) images.
9. The method of claim 7 further comprising training the classifier based on multiple training images and using a mapping between the training images and probe positions from which the training images were acquired as ground truth.
10. The method of claim 7 wherein the next maneuver is represented by navigational instructions.
11. The method of claim 10 wherein the navigational instructions comprise machine instructions that are executable by a robotic controller to automatically steer the probe to a desired position.
12. The method of claim 7 wherein outputting the predicted position comprises displaying the probe at the predicted position in a graphical representation of the structure of interest.
13. The method of claim 12 wherein the graphical representation of the structure of interest comprises a three-dimensional rendering of the structure of interest.
14. The method of claim 12 wherein the graphical representation of the structure of interest comprises an image-derived model of the structure of interest.
15. The method of claim 12 further comprising repeating steps (i), (ii) and (iii) to update the graphical representation in substantially real time as the probe acquires a new current image at a new position.
16. The method of claim 7 wherein predicting the position of the probe comprises further applying a time history of position predictions to the trained classifier.
17. A system for probe positioning, comprising: a non-transitory memory device for storing computer readable program code; and a processor in communication with the memory device, the processor being operative with the computer readable program code to perform steps including (i) receiving a current image acquired by a probe within a structure of interest, (ii) predicting a position of the probe and generating a recommendation of a next maneuver to be performed using the probe by applying the current image to a trained classifier, and (iii) outputting the predicted position and the recommendation of the next maneuver.
18. The system of claim 17 wherein the probe comprises an intracardiac echocardiogram (ICE) catheter.
19. The system of claim 17 wherein the processor is operative with the computer readable program code to output the predicted position by displaying the probe at the predicted position in a graphical representation of the structure of interest.
