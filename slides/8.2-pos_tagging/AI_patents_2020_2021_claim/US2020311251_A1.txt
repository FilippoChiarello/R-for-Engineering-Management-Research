PASSWORD MANAGEMENT TOOL EMPLOYING NEURAL NETWORKS
</title>

<abstract>
A password management method employs one or more items from multiple categories of available information to enable user access to a secure resource. A user-specific strong password is generated. A neural network is trained to recall the strong password from the one or more items. Examples of such items may include a combination of letters, numbers, characters, and/or symbols, or pictures, in one category; information related to hardware used to access the secure resource, in another category; and a user's biometric information, in yet another category. Items may come from other categories as well. The neural network may reside on the hardware used to access the secure resource, or may reside at the secure resource itself, or in the cloud.

<claims>
1. A password management method comprising: generating a strong password; providing a first item from one of a plurality of categories of information; providing said strong password and said first item to a neural network on a first piece of hardware; and training said neural network to recall said strong password from said first item.
2. A method according to claim 1, further comprising creating a user account with a username and password prior to generating said strong password.
3. A method according to claim 1, wherein said plurality of categories of information comprise a first category of information which comprises words, phrases, numbers, and/or pictures.
4. A method according to claim 3, wherein said plurality of categories of information further comprise a second category of information which comprises information related to said first piece of hardware.
5. A method according to claim 4, wherein said plurality of categories of information further comprise a third category of information which comprises biometric information of a user.
6. A method according to claim 2, wherein said first item is different from said username and password.
7. A method according to claim 1, further comprising: providing a second item from a different one of said plurality of categories of information; and providing said second item to said neural network on said first piece of hardware; wherein said training comprises training said neural network to recall said strong password from said first and second items.
8. A method according to claim 7, further comprising: providing a third item from a still different one of said plurality of categories of information; and providing said third item to said neural network on said first piece of hardware; wherein said training comprises training said neural network to recall said strong password from said first through third items.
9. A method according to claim 1, wherein generating said strong password comprises randomly selecting characters selected from the group consisting of numbers, symbols, upper case characters, and lower characters, and combining the randomly selected characters in a group of a predetermined length.
10. A method according to claim 1, further comprising accessing a secure resource after said neural network recalls said strong password.
11. A method according to claim 1, further comprising: providing a further item, from one of said plurality of categories of information, and said strong password to said neural network via a second, different piece of hardware; and re-training said neural network to recall said strong password from said further item.
12. A method according to claim 1, wherein said neural network is selected from the group consisting of a feed-forward neural network, a recurrent neural network, and a spiking neural network.
13. A method according to claim 1, wherein said neural network is a neural network with one or more hidden layers.
14. A method according to claim 1, wherein said neural network is located on said first piece of hardware.
15. A method according to claim 10, wherein the neural network is located at said secure resource.
16. A method according to claim 1, further comprising: providing a further item, from one of said plurality of categories of information, and said strong password to a second, different neural network via a second, different piece of hardware; and training said second neural network to recall said strong password from said further item.
17. A method according to claim 16, further comprising accessing a secure resource after said second neural network recalls said strong password.
18. A method according to claim 16, wherein said second neural network is located on said second piece of hardware.
19. A method according to claim 17, wherein said second neural network is located at said secure resource.
