<title>
Image capture for a multi-dimensional building model
</title>

<abstract>
A process for receiving, from a computing device, a series of captured building images. The process continues by processing, in real-time, each building image in the series of captured building images to determine if each building image meets a minimum criterion, wherein the minimum criteria includes applicability to be used in constructing a specific digital multi-dimensional building model. The process continues by aggregating each image meeting the minimum criteria, determining when a base set of building images has been aggregated, wherein the base set of building images includes a threshold number images to model at least a partial multi-dimensional building model representing the series of captured building images, determining one or more facades present in the partial multi-dimensional building model, determining preliminary dimensions for one or more architectural features of the one or more facades and returning, incrementally (in real-time), the preliminary dimensions to the computing device.

<claims>
1. A method of processing imagery, comprises: receiving, from a capture device, a plurality of input images comprising a partial view of a subject building; receiving a desired estimate analysis related to the subject building within the plurality of input images; determining, for each of the plurality of input images whether a minimum criterion is met, wherein the minimum criterion indicates applicability for constructing a multi-dimensional building model based on the desired estimate analysis; aggregating an image set comprising each of the plurality of input images meeting the minimum criterion; constructing a base multi-dimensional building model of the subject building from the aggregated image set; and returning a responsive estimate based on the constructed base multi-dimensional building model.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the desired estimate analysis is a requested dimension of the subject building.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the requested dimension is a square footage estimate of a surface of the subject building.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the square footage estimate of a surface of the subject building further includes a replacement materials report including replacement cost of a replacement material based on the square footage estimate.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the surface of the subject building is a roof surface.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the minimum criterion comprises detecting at least one specific feature.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the detecting the at least one specific feature comprises detecting a vertical line representing a corner of the subject building.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the base multi-dimensional model comprises a multi-dimensional building model constructed from a threshold number of images from the aggregated image set to derive the responsive estimate.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the responsive estimate is a calculated dimension from at least one measurement of the base multi-dimensional building model.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the responsive estimate is a calculated dimension from at least one measurement of the base multi-dimensional building model.
11. The method of claim 1 further comprises updating the base multi-dimensional building model with additional ones of input images exceeding a threshold number of images from the aggregated image set to derive the responsive estimate.
12. The method of claim 11 further comprises calculating a refined responsive estimate based on at least one measurement from the updated base multi-dimensional building model.
