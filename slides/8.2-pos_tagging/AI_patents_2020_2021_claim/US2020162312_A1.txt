System and method for recommending automation solutions for technology infrastructure issues
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method to intelligently formulate automation strategies for technology infrastructure operations are disclosed. The system and method include analyzing infrastructure issue data from support tickets and predicting automation solutions. A cost-benefit analysis is then performed on the automation solutions. Solutions can be ranked and recommended according to the cost-benefit analysis.
