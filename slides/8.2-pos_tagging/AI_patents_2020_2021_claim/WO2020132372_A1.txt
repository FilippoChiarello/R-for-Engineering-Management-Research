<title>
EMPTY CONTAINER DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
Devices, systems, and methods for determining whether a container is empty in the context of robotic picking solutions. The system includes a plurality of sensors configured to gather container data regarding a container at a first location, wherein the container data includes at least two of weight data related to the container, depth data related to the container, and color sensor data related to the container, and a processor configured to execute instructions stored on a memory to provide a sensor fusion module configured to process the received container data to determine whether the container is empty.
</abstract>

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method of detecting whether a container is empty, the method comprising:
receiving a container at a first location;
receiving container data from a plurality of sensors, wherein the container data includes at least two of:
weight data related to the container,
depth data related to the container, and
color sensor data related to the container;
processing, using a processor executing instructions stored on memory to provide a sensor fusion module, the received container data to determine whether the container is empty; and
autonomously removing the container from the first location upon the sensor fusion module determining the containeris empty.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
perturbing the container;
determining that the containeris not empty after perturbing the container; and removing at least one item from the container after determining that the container is not empty.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising generating a confidence score regarding a likelihood the container is empty, wherein the confidence score is based on the received container data.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising:
perturbing the container upon determining the confidence score is less than a predetermined threshold;
gathering a second set of data regarding the perturbed container; and
analyzing the second set of data to generate a second confidence score regarding a second likelihood the containeris empty.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the container is on a conveyor belt, and the method further includes moving the container with the conveyor belt from the first location to a second location upon determining the confidence score is greater than a predetermined threshold.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising detecting that the containeris present at the first location.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of sensors are used to provide at least two of the weight data, the depth data, and the color sensor data, and the plurality of sensors are collocated with a robotic picking device.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising comparing the received container data to at least one of known weight data of the container or known appearance data of the container stored on the memory to determine whether the container is empty.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising using a sensing modality to detect items at least 0.5 cm in length in all principal directions.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising grasping and shaking the container with a robotic picking device to move an item in the container.
11. A system for detecting whether a container is empty, the system comprising:
a plurality of sensors configured to gather container data regarding a container at a first location, wherein the container data includes at least two of:
weight data related to the container,
depth data related to the container, and
color sensor data related to the container; and
a processor configured to:
execute instructions stored on memory to provide a sensor fusion module configured to process the received container data to determine whether the container is empty.
12. The system of claim 11, further comprising a picking device configured to perturb the container.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the picking device is further configured to grasp the container to move an item in the container.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the memory stores at least one of known weight data and known appearance data, and the processor is configured to compare the stored data to the received container data to determine whether the container is empty.
15. The system of claim 11, wherein the container is located on a conveyor belt and the conveyor belt is configured to move the container from the first location to a second location upon the sensor fusion module determining that the container is empty.
16. The system of claim 11, wherein the processor is further configured to generate a confidence score regardinga likelihood the containeris empty.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein the processor is further configured to:
send a signal to perturb the container upon determining the confidence score is less than a predetermined threshold;
gather, with the plurality of sensors, a second set of data regarding the perturbed container;
analyze the second set of data; and
generate a second confidence score regarding a second likelihood the container is empty.
18. The system of claim 11 further comprising an interface configured to communicate with at least one picking device.
19. The system of claim 11, wherein the plurality of sensors are collocated on a picking device.
20. The system of claim 11, wherein the plurality of sensors include a plurality of interconnected sensors.
