SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING DENTAL SERVICES TO A PATIENT
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method providing a dental patient and dental provider with a selection portal for services to allow a patient to find a provider and a provider to assess the needs and interests of the patient prior to a visit, and to provide treatment facilitating/smile preview devices for use at the initial visit.
</abstract>

<claims>
I claim:
1. A method useful for providing recommended dental services to a patient, the method comprising the steps of: a. providing a user interface of a platform; b. receiving through the user interface of the platform patient information comprising at least one digital image of the patient; c. generating a digital preview of the recommended dental services based on the at least one digital image of the patient; d. providing a service provider with the patient information and the digital treatment preview and the opportunity to accept the patient's case; e. prompting the service provider and the patient to schedule a clinical appointment; f. if the service provider schedules a clinical appointment, using the at least one digital image of the patient and the digital preview to prepare a physical model demonstrating the recommended dental services prior to the patient appointment; and g. incorporating the physical model of the recommended dental services in a try-in step during the clinical appointment.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of before the generating a digital preview step, determining through artificial intelligence incorporated into the platform whether the at least one digital image of the patient complies with platform requirements.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the physical model of the recommended dental services is prepared by prototyping equipment.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising the step of transmitting the at least one digital image of the patient and the digital treatment preview to the prototyping equipment.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of receiving from a user device a list of user prioritized service provider attributes before the prompting the service provider step.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising the step of displaying at the user device a ranked list of at least a portion of the service providers according to the user prioritized service provider list before the prompting the service provider step.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the prompting the service provider step comprises prompting the ranked list of service providers until a particular service provider schedules the clinical appointment.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of receiving the at least one digital image of the patient comprises one of (a) prompting the user to capture the at least one digital image of the patient using image capturing software of a user device and (b) receiving a previously captured digital patient image from a storage of the user device.
9. An integrated system with computerized components useful for providing recommended dental services to a patient, the system comprising: a. a server comprising a plurality of data associated with a plurality of service providers; b. an Internet-accessible platform in communication with the server and accessible via a network by a computing device, wherein the platform comprises: i. a user interface configured to receive patient information from the computing device, wherein the patient information comprises at least one patient image; ii. a digital preview module configured to generate a digital preview of the recommended dental services; iii. a scheduling interface configured to (a) display a list of a number of the service providers, (b) display scheduling information associated with each of the displayed service providers, and (c) receive selective input from the patient indicating the patient's selection of at least one of the number of service providers for the recommended dental services; iv. a data transmit module configured to transmit the patient information, the digital preview, and the selective patient input to the server; v. a provider interface configured to (a) display the patient information, the digital preview, and the selective patient input at a provider computing device, (b) receive selective input from the provider scheduling a patient appointment for a selected date, and (c) provide instructions to prepare a physical sample of the recommended dental services based on the patient information and digital preview prior to the date of the patient appointment.
10. The system of claim 9, further comprising a prototyping equipment in communication with the server, the prototyping equipment configured to receive the physical sample preparation instructions from the platform and to prepare the physical sample according to the preparation instructions.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the prototyping equipment is a 3-D printer.
12. The system of claim 9, further comprising an artificial intelligence engine configured to analyze the patient image for compliance with a platform requirement.
13. The system of claim 9, wherein the platform further comprises a review module configured to receive from the user device one or more review information associated with the service provider after the date of the patient appointment.
14. The system of claim 9, wherein the platform further comprises a search module configured to display a service provider results list at the user device responsive to a search query at the user device.
15. A method of producing a denture try-in with a denture baseplate having a surface and artificial teeth, the method comprising: a. fabricating the denture baseplate; b. fabricating the artificial teeth separately from the denture baseplate, each individual tooth of the artificial teeth fabricated in situ in proper spatial orientation, whereby each individual tooth of the artificial teeth may be removed and repositioned individually or in groups; c. fabricating print support framework holding the artificial teeth in situ, the framework comprising scaffolding pillars secured to the artificial teeth and the surface of the denture baseplate, maintaining physical separation and spatial orientation of each individual tooth of the artificial teeth and the surface of the denture baseplate; and d. applying wax to the base of each individual tooth of the artificial teeth and the denture baseplate, whereby the artificial teeth are connected to the denture baseplate prior to any removal of the print support framework.
