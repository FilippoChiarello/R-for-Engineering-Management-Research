</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for in location-based mobile payments are disclosed. According to one embodiment, in an information processing apparatus comprising at least one computer processor, a method for location-based mobile payments may include: (1) receiving, from a first computer program executed by a first electronic device for a first party, a request to conduct a location-based transaction; (2) receiving, from the first computer program, a location of the first electronic device; (3) identifying a potential counterparty based on a location of a second electronic device associated with the potential counterparty; (4) communicating an image of the potential counterparty to the first computer program; (5) receiving a selection of the potential counterparty from the first computer program; and (6) conducting the location-based transaction between the party and the potential counterparty.

<claims>
1. A method for registering for location-based payments, comprising: in an information processing apparatus comprising at least one computer processor: receiving, from a computer program executed by an electronic device, a registration request to register an individual or a merchant for location-based mobile payments; receiving, from the computer program, an image of the individual or a logo for the merchant; capturing identifying information for the electronic device; receiving, from the computer program, an identification of an account associated with the individual or merchant for sending or receiving money; and storing an association of the image or logo, the identifying information for the electronic device, and the identification of the account.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the electronic device comprises a mobile electronic device.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving location information for the merchant; and associating the location information with the image or logo, the identifying information for the electronic device, and the identification of the account
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the electronic device comprises a point of sale device.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein a first account is identified for sending money, and a second account is identified for receiving money.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the identification information comprises at least one of a MAC address, a serial number, an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), an Extended Unique Identifier (EUI), an Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI), an International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI), and a Mobile Station ISDN (MSISDN).
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving, from the individual or the merchant, an identification of at least one condition under which additional authentication is required.
8. A method for location-based mobile payments, comprising: in an information processing apparatus comprising at least one computer processor: receiving, from a first computer program executed by a first electronic device for a first party, a request to conduct a location-based transaction; receiving, from the first computer program, a location of the first electronic device; identifying a potential counterparty based on a location of a second electronic device associated with the potential counterparty; communicating an image of the potential counterparty to the first computer program; receiving a selection of the potential counterparty from the first computer program; and conducting the location-based transaction between the party and the potential counterparty.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the first electronic device comprises a mobile electronic device.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the second electronic device comprises a point of sale device.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein the potential counterparty is a merchant, and the image comprises a logo associated with the merchant.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the party is a merchant, and the counterparty is a customer.
13. The method of claim 8, wherein the location of the second electronic device is within a predetermined distance of the first electronic device.
14. The method of claim 8, wherein conducting the location-based transaction between the party and the potential counterparty comprises: retrieving identified accounts for the transaction for the party and the potential counterparty from a database.
15. The method of claim 8, further comprising: receiving an identification of accounts for the transaction from at least one of the party and the potential counterparty.
16. The method of claim 8, further comprising: communicating an image of the party to a second computer program executed by the second electronic device; and receiving a confirmation for the transaction from the second computer program.
17. The method of claim 8, wherein a plurality of potential counterparties are identified.
18. The method of claim 17, further comprising: ranking the plurality of potential counterparties; and communicating the ranking of the potential counterparties to the first computer program.
19. The method of claim 17, wherein the plurality of potential counterparties are ranked based a proximity to the first electronic device.
20. The method of claim 17, wherein the plurality of potential counterparties are ranked based on at least one prior transaction conducted by at least one of the potential counterparties.
