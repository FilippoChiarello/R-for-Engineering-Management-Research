<title>
METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR DATA TRAFFIC BASED ADAPTIVE SECURITY
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to traffic monitoring through one or more access control servers configured configured for (i) routing server resource request messages to resource server(s), (ii) extracting information identifying a target server resource from data packets corresponding to one or more received server resource request messages, and (iii) selectively transmitting the received server resource request message to a resource server. The security server(s) is configured to receive a server resource request message data extracted from a server resource request message and initiate a first security response, wherein the initiated first security response is dependent on analysis of the server resource request message data. Responsive to identifying an indicator of compromise or that an originating terminal corresponding to the server resource request is identified within a blacklist, the first security response comprises non-transmission of at least one server resource request message by the access control server to a resource server.
