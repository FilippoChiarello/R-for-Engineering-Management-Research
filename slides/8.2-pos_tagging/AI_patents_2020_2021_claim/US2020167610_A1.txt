METHOD OF PREDICTING DEMAND OF VIRTUAL NETWORK FUNCTION RESOURCES TO WHICH MACHINE LEARNING IS APPLIED
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a technique in which demand prediction of resources of virtual network functions (VNFs) that provide a core technology in a network virtualization environment is performed using machine learning technology. In the present invention, in order to predict VNF resource information, not only are the resources of the VNFs as data but also information of surrounding VNFs that are directly or indirectly related are used, and prediction is possible even in a dynamically changed network environment. In addition, service function chain (SFC) data among various pieces of network information is used to reduce a time required for machine learning according to a size of an entire network.

<claims>
1. A method of predicting demand of resources of virtual network functions (VNFs) to which machine learning is applied, the method comprising: (a) a step of classifying and defining feature data representing features of data to be used for machine learning and applying a long short term memory (LSTM) as a model of the machine learning; (b) a step of learning by assigning attention parameters to important feature data while learning an entire feature data set using a target dependent LSTM model in which different types of data are input into the LSTM according to a target; (c) a step of learning which VNF is closely related to a target VNF using aspect embedding during attention learning; (d) a step of additionally using auxiliary data in addition to main data when resource information of the target VNF is predicted based on resource information of the VNFs in a service function chain (SFC); and (e) a step of generating a final result value by combining a result value obtained by attention with a result value obtained from a last LSTM cell, among result values of the resource prediction obtained using a series of learning processes.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the feature data in step (a) is classified into target data, VNF data, and content data.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein, in step (a), labeling data is further used as a classification criterion for the feature data.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein data to be used for the machine learning in step (a) includes one or more of entire VNF resource information of the SFC to which the target VNF belongs, content data to be used as additional information, a unique number of the target VNF, and a labeling value.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the LSTM in step (a) has a form in which a cell state is added to a hidden state.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model in step (a) uses the resource data of individual VNFs and the SFC as input data.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the LSTM model in step (b) is the target dependent LSTM model using attention, aspect, and content embedding technology.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein, in order to define the target dependent LSTM model, step (b) includes: dividing the input data into two pieces of data based on the target VNF; learning the divided input data in each LSTM; and combining the learned data in the LSTM with each other.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the auxiliary data in step (d) includes any one or more of a type of the entire SFC, an SFC chain length, and time series data.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the result value in step (e) is obtained by an operation of machine learning by combining the result value obtained by the attention and the result value obtained from a last LSTM cell.
