<title>
SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PREDICTIVE CURATION, PRODUCTION INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PERSONAL CONTENT ASSISTANT
</title>

<abstract>
Data points, calendar entries, trends, and behavioral patterns may be used to predict and pre-emptively build digital and printable products with selected collections of images without the user's active participation. The collections are selected from files on the user's device, cloud-based photo library, or other libraries shared among other individuals and grouped into thematic products. Based on analysis of the user's collections and on-line behaviors, the system may estimate types and volumes of potential media-centric products, and the resources needed for producing and distributing such media-centric products for a projected period of time. A user interface may take the form of a "virtual curator", which is a graphical or animated persona for augmenting and managing interactions between the user and the system managing the user's stored media assets. The virtual curator can assume one of many personas with each user and can interact with the user via text/audio messaging.

<claims>
1. (canceled)
2. A computer-implemented method configured to be performed on a networked computational device comprising a processor, the method comprising: using the processor to verify an identity of a user account; using the processor to identify a workflow trigger, wherein the workflow trigger comprises receiving multimedia assets at the networked computational device or a remote database; using the processor to extract metadata associated with the multimedia assets; using the processor to assign semantic tags to each multimedia asset based on the extracted metadata; using the processor to sort the multimedia assets into groups, wherein each group corresponds to a semantic event and each semantic event is derived from the semantic tags; using the processor to sort the multimedia assets in each group into thematic subgroups; using the processor to assign group tags and thematic tags to the multimedia assets, wherein the group tags and thematic tags correspond to the groups and the thematic subgroups into which the multimedia assets are sorted; weighing the semantic tags, the group tags, and the thematic tags based on a frequency of occurrence of each tag in association with the multimedia assets; ranking the multimedia assets based on a weight of the semantic tags, the group tags, and the thematic tags associated with each multimedia asset; identifying an important image, wherein the important image is the highest ranked multimedia asset; and preparing a virtual version of a customized media-centric product to be offered to the user, wherein the customized media-centric product incorporates the important image.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: extracting user-preferred thematic tags from the user account, wherein weighing the semantic tags, the group tags, and the thematic tags comprises weighing the user-preferred thematic tags most heavily.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: using the processor to assess accuracy of the semantic tags, the group tags, and the thematic tags by comparing the semantic tags, the group tags, and the thematic tags to ground truth data.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising: using the processor to run a deep learning model, wherein the deep learning model uses the assessment of accuracy of the semantic tags, the group tags, and the thematic tags to improve tagging models for assigning the semantic tags, the group tags, and the thematic tags.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: using the processor to analyze the semantic tags, the group tags, and the thematic tags to determine event boundaries within the multimedia assets.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein using the processor to sort the multimedia assets into groups comprises forming groups based on location metadata in combination with ontological reasoning.
8. A computer-implemented method configured to be performed on a networked computational device comprising a processor, the method comprising: the processor verifying an identity of a user account; the processor uploading multimedia assets associated with the user account; the processor extracting metadata from the multimedia assets and storing the extracted metadata in a triplestore database; the processor using frequent item set mining on the extracted metadata to identify a plurality of themes in the multimedia assets; the processor organizing the multimedia assets into a plurality of groups, each group corresponding to one of the plurality of themes in the multimedia assets; selecting a preferred group of multimedia assets from the plurality of groups, wherein the selection comprises matching a thematic interest associated with the user account with the theme corresponding to the preferred group of multimedia assets; generating a virtual version of a candidate media-centric product, wherein the candidate media-centric product incorporates at least one multimedia asset from the preferred group of multimedia assets; and presenting the virtual version of the candidate media-centric product to a user.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 8, wherein the extracted metadata comprises semantic tags and wherein the semantic tags are used to identify the plurality of themes in the multimedia assets.
10. The computer-implemented method of claim 9, wherein the semantic tags have an ontological structure.
11. The computer-implemented method of claim 10, wherein the extracted metadata further comprises location information.
12. The computer-implemented method of claim 8, wherein the user account is associated with a social media account and wherein selecting a preferred group of multimedia assets from the plurality of groups comprises selecting the group containing multimedia assets having accumulated the most "likes" on the social media network.
13. The computer-implemented method of claim 8, wherein each of the plurality of themes corresponds to a unique activity.
14. The computer-implemented method of claim 8, wherein the user account is associated with a social media account, and wherein the extracted metadata comprises social media usage activity, wherein the social media usage activity comprises commenting on the social media account on a multimedia asset.
