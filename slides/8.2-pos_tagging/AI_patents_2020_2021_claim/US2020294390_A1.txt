SECURITY SYSTEMS INTEGRATION
</title>

<abstract>
A security system having a seamless integration wearable, portable, personal or body cameras for observant personnel, a locator sensor associated with each camera, a graphical user interface (GUI) module having a display, and a processor connected to the cameras and the locator sensor associated with each camera, and connected to the GUI module. Video from the cameras may be fed to the GUI. The video may be annotated by the processor with locations from locator sensors associated with the cameras. The display may provide a visualization of the location of each camera. The processor may incorporate an artificial intelligence module to process the video and locations, and based on results of processing the video and locations, can detect and model threats from the video and locations. An assessment of the threats, based on models of the threats, may result in alerts.

<claims>
1. A facility access security system comprising: an access control system having an access control mechanism configured to receive a user's credentials at one or more points of entry to the premises, facilities and spaces within the premises and facilities, respectfully; an indoor positioning system configured to a locate one or more users within the premises and facilities; and an analytics module connected to a first output of the access control system and a second output of the indoor positioning system.
2. The facility access security system of claim 1, wherein the analytics module receives access control information from the first output of the access control system and location information from the second output of the indoor positioning system, and generates a threat model relative to access to the premises.
3. The facility access security system of claim 2, wherein indoor positioning system is configured to provide a location of one or more users to an emergency responder.
4. The facility access security system of claim 2, wherein the analytics module is configured to provide an alert when a visitor to the premises is unescorted.
5. The facility access security system of claim 2, wherein: the analytics module is configured to generate an alert when lone workers are within the premises; or the analytics module is configured to generate an alert when a user accesses a non-typical location at a non-typical time.
6. The facility access security system of claim 2, wherein the analytics module is configured to fuse the access control information and the location information and analyzed to determine a security of the premises.
7. A facility access security system comprising: an access control system having an access control mechanism configured to receive a user's credentials at one or more points of entry to the premises, facilities and spaces within the premises and facilities, respectfully; a data security analytics module; and an alerting system connected to a first output of the access control system and a second output of the data security analytics module; and wherein the alerting system receives access control information from the first output of the access control system and a threat profile of a data user from the second output of data security analytics module and generates an alert.
8. The facility access security system of claim 7, wherein the alert is rule based.
9. The facility access security system of claim 7, wherein the alerting system is configured to alert when a data user who is categorized as a high is present in the premises, an enhanced video surveillance is initiated through a video management systems
10. The facility access security system of claim 7, wherein the alerting system is configured to detect suspicious behaviors of an individual.
11. An asset management system comprising: one or more assets each including a real time location service (RTLS) tag; a RTLS server in communication with the one or more RTLS tags; one or more video cameras configured to provide an output to an asset recognition module; and a data analytics module connected to a first output of the RTLS server and a second output of the asset recognition module; and wherein the data analytics module receives asset location information from the first output of the RTLS server and metadata from the asset recognition module and generates a report.
12. The asset management system of claim 11, wherein the report includes a location of the one or more assets, a date, and video indexing.
13. The asset management system of claim 11, wherein the data analytics module is configured to render real time location information of the one or more assets on a facility map.
14. The asset management system of claim 11, wherein the data analytics module is configured to issue an alert when one of the one or more assets is misplaced.
15. The asset management system of claim 11, wherein the asset recognition module is configured to recognize at least one asset of the one or more assets from a video feed of the one or more video cameras.
16. The asset management system of claim 11, wherein the data analytics module is configured to recognize a human face captured in proximity to at least one asset of the one or more assets.
17. The asset management system of claim 11, wherein the data analytics module is configured to receive a query.
18. The asset management system of claim 17, wherein the query includes tracing a misplaced asset.
19. The asset management system of claim 17, wherein the query requests a last known location of the misplaced asset.
20. The asset management system of claim 17, wherein the query requests an identity of a person who last interacted with misplaced asset.
