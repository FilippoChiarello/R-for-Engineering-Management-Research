DISPLAY APPARATUS AND CONTROL METHOD THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
A display apparatus is provided. The display apparatus may include a display; a communicator including circuitry configured to communicate with a server; a user input unit including circuitry configured to receive a user input; a processor configured to: based on a first user input, control the display to display a menu providing at least one image quality of a preview content that is selectable, receive a second user input of selecting the at least one image quality of the preview content, control the communicator to transmit a request for the preview content at the selected image quality to the server, and control the display to display an image based on the preview content received from the server.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A display apparatus comprising: a display; a communicator comprising circuitry configured to communicate with a server; a user input unit comprising circuitry configured to receive a user input; a processor configured to: based on a first user input, control the display to display a menu providing at least one image quality of a preview content that is selectable, receive a second user input of selecting the at least one image quality of the preview content, control the communicator to transmit a request for the preview content at the selected image quality to the server, and control the display to display an image based on the preview content received from the server.
2. The display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to control the display to display the image based on the preview content having the selected image quality to be displayed on a full screen.
3. The display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the second user input selects two or more image qualities of the preview content, and the processor is further configured to control the display to display images based on preview contents of the two or more selected image qualities received from the server.
4. The display apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the processor is further configured to: divide a screen of the display into a plurality of areas corresponding to a number of the selected image qualities, assign the preview contents having the selected image qualities to the plurality of areas, and control a part of the image based on the assigned preview content to be displayed on each of the plurality of areas.
5. The display apparatus according to claim 3, further comprising a hardware decoder configured to decode a first preview content, wherein the processor is further configured to drive a software decoder and control the software decoder to decode a second preview content.
6. The display apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the processor is configured to control the hardware decoder to process the first preview content having a relatively higher image quality among a plurality of preview contents.
7. The display apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the processor is further configured to process the preview contents to be alternately decoded.
8. The display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to output a sound corresponding to the preview content, and display the preview content with an interface for indicating whether the sound is output.
9. The display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to display the menu with guide information about selectable image qualities.
10. The display apparatus according to claim 9, wherein the guide information is generated based on a performance of the display apparatus or a network state between the display apparatus and the server.
11. A method of controlling a display apparatus, comprising: based on a first user input, displaying a menu providing at least one image quality of a preview content that is selectable, receiving a second user input of selecting the at least one image quality of the preview content, transmitting a request for the preview content at the selected image quality, to a server, and displaying an image based on the preview content received from the server.
12. The method according to claim 11, wherein the displaying of the image based on the preview content comprises using a full screen to display the image based on the preview content having the selected image quality.
13. The method according to claim 11, wherein the second user input selects two or more among the image qualities, and the displaying of the image based on the preview content further comprises displaying images based on preview contents of two or more selected image qualities.
14. The method according to claim 13, wherein the displaying of the images based on the preview contents comprises: dividing a screen of the display into a plurality of areas corresponding to a number of the selected image qualities, assigning the preview contents having the selected image qualities to the plurality of areas, and controlling a part of the image based on the assigned preview content to be displayed on each of the plurality of areas.
15. The method according to claim 13, wherein the display apparatus further comprises a hardware decoder configured to decode a first preview content, and wherein the displaying of the images based on the preview contents further comprises driving a software decoder to decode a second preview content.
16. The method according to claim 15, further comprising controlling the hardware decoder to process the first preview content having a relatively higher image quality among a plurality of preview contents.
17. The method according to claim 13, further comprising processing the preview contents to be alternately decoded.
18. The method according to claim 11, further comprising: outputting a sound corresponding to the preview content, and displaying the preview content with an interface for indicating whether the sound is output.
19. The method according to claim 11, further comprising displaying the menu with guide information about selectable image qualities.
20. The method according to claim 19, wherein the guide information is generated based on performance of the display apparatus or a network state between the display apparatus and the server.
