<title>
Method of performing feedforward and recurrent operations in an artificial neural network using nonvolatile memory cells
</title>

<abstract>
A method for achieving a feedforward operation and/or a recurrent operation in an artificial neural network having a self-training learning function. The forgoing artificial neural network (ANN) comprises M×N numbers nonvolatile memory cells that are arranged to form a memory array, and the nonvolatile memory cell can be a non-overlapped implementation (NOI) MOSFET, a RRAM element, a PCM element, a MRAM element, or a SONOS element. By applying this novel method to the ANN, it is able to perform the feedforward and recurrent operations in the M×N numbers of nonvolatile memory cells storing with different bit weights that are formed by injected electrons through the self-training learning function of the ANN.
