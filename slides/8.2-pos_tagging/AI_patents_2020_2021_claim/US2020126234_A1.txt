METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PREDICTING CELL REPROGRAMMING
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein are methods for predicting the reprogramming process of cells from a microscopic image of one or more cells. According to some embodiments, the method includes capturing an image of region of interest (ROI) of every pixel of the microscopic image, followed by processing the ROI image with a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model and a trained long short-term memory (LSTM) network so as to obtain predicted probability maps. Also disclosed herein are a storage medium and a system for executing the present methods.
