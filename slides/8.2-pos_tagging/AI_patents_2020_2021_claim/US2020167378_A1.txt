<title>
SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR THOUGHT OBJECT SELECTION
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for processing qualitative responses from a plurality of user devices whereby a selection of a next thought object, to deliver to a first user device, may be based on a plurality of qualitative responses received from a plurality of user devices. In a preferred embodiment, a thought object selection computer may compute the selection by determining a filtered set of thought objects by custom selection. In some embodiments, if the quantity of the filtered set of thought objects is greater than a pre-configured amount the selection may be computed by randomly selecting a subset of the filtered set of thought objects. Further filtering the filtered set of thought objects by determining one or more least seen thought objects, and selecting a most diverse thought object, updating the filtered set of thought objects and sending the filtered set of thought objects to the first user device.

5. The system of claim 4, wherein to make the text suitable for topic modeling comprises a further plurality of programming instructions, the further plurality of programming instructions when executed by the processor cause the processor to: convert thought object text to lower case; split the text into tokens; remove tokens that exist in a pre-configured referenced list of stop words; and, stem the remaining tokens.
6.
