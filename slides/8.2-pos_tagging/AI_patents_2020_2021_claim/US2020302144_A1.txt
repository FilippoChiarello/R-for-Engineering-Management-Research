<title>
ADAPTIVE SENSING BASED ON DEPTH
</title>

<abstract>
A microscope for adaptive sensing may comprise an illumination assembly, an image capture device configured to collect light from a sample illuminated by the assembly, and a processor. The processor may be configured to execute instructions which cause the microscope to capture, using the image capture device, an initial image set of the sample, identify, in response to the initial image set, an attribute of the sample, determine, in response to identifying the attribute, a three-dimensional (3D) process for sensing the sample, and generate, using the determined 3D process, an output image set comprising more than one focal plane. Various other methods, systems, and computer-readable media are also disclosed.
