<title>
NETWORK ANALYZER AND NETWORK ANALYZING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A network analyzer includes a storage and a processor to provide an answer to inquiry including an inquiry statement and device log. The storage stores first information indicating relation between a previously received inquiry statement and an answer for the inquiry statement and second information indicating relation between previously received device log and an answer for the device log. The processor selects a first answer candidate for a new inquiry statement and calculates a first degree of certainty of the first answer candidate based on the first information. The processor selects a second answer candidate for new device log corresponding to the new inquiry statement and calculates a second degree of certainty of the second answer candidate based on the second information. The processor determines an answer based on the first answer candidate, the first degree of certainty, the second answer candidate, and the second degree of certainty.

<claims>
1. A network analyzer that provides an answer to an inquiry including an inquiry statement about a network failure and a device log corresponding to the inquiry statement, the network analyzer comprising: a storage configured to store first information that indicates a relation between a previously received inquiry statement and an answer that has been provided in response to an inquiry including the inquiry statement and second information that indicates a relation between a previously received device log and an answer that has been provided in response to an inquiry including the device log; and a processor configured to select a first answer candidate from a plurality of answer patterns in response to a new inquiry statement and calculate a first degree of certainty that indicates a certainty of the first answer candidate based on the first information, select a second answer candidate from the plurality of answer patterns in response to a new device log corresponding to the new inquiry statement and calculate a second degree of certainty that indicates a certainty of the second answer candidate based on the second information, and determine an answer to the new inquiry statement based on the first answer candidate, the first degree of certainty, the second answer candidate, and the second degree of certainty.
2. The network analyzer according to claim 1, wherein the processor extracts, from the new device log, log information within a time range that corresponds to information related to a point in time written in the new inquiry statement, and based on the second information, the processor selects the second answer candidate from the plurality of answer patterns for the extracted log information and calculates the second degree of certainty that indicates a certainty of the second answer candidate.
3. The network analyzer according to claim 1, wherein the processor determines the answer to the new inquiry statement based on an average value of the first degree of certainty and the second degree of certainty.
4. The network analyzer according to claim 1, wherein the processor determines a contribution ratio of the first degree of certainty and a contribution ratio of the second degree of certainty based on a correlation value that indicates a correlation between the first answer candidate and the second answer candidate and determines the answer to the new inquiry statement based on a weighted average of the first degree of certainty and the second degree of certainty according to the contribution ratios.
5. The network analyzer according to claim 4, wherein as the correlation value becomes smaller, the contribution ratio of the second degree of certainty becomes higher compared with the contribution ratio of the first degree of certainty.
6. The network analyzer according to claim 1, wherein when a correlation value that indicates a correlation between the first answer candidate and the second answer candidate is larger than a specified threshold, a relation between the new inquiry and an answer determined by the processor is added to the first information.
7. The network analyzer according to claim 1, wherein the processor extracts an interface number of a network device in a process of extracting one word or a plurality of words from the new device log and determines the second answer candidate based on the second information and the word or the words extracted from the new device log.
8. A network analyzing method that provides an answer to an inquiry including an inquiry statement about a network failure and a device log corresponding to the inquiry statement, the method comprising: selecting a first answer candidate from a plurality of answer patterns in response to a new inquiry statement and calculating a first degree of certainty that indicates a certainty of the first answer candidate based on first information that indicates a relation between a previously received inquiry statement and an answer that has been provided in response to an inquiry including the inquiry statement, selecting a second answer candidate from the plurality of answer patterns in response to a new device log corresponding to the new inquiry statement and calculating a second degree of certainty that indicates a certainty of the second answer candidate based on second information that indicates a relation between a previously received device log and an answer that has been provided in response to an inquiry including the device log, and determining an answer to the new inquiry statement based on the first answer candidate, the first degree of certainty, the second answer candidate, and the second degree of certainty.
9. A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium having stored therein a network analyzing program that causes a processor to execute a process, the process comprising: selecting a first answer candidate from a plurality of answer patterns in response to a new inquiry statement and calculating a first degree of certainty that indicates a certainty of the first answer candidate based on first information that indicates a relation between a previously received inquiry statement about a network failure and an answer that has been provided in response to an inquiry including the inquiry statement, selecting a second answer candidate from the plurality of answer patterns in response to a new device log corresponding to the new inquiry statement and calculating a second degree of certainty that indicates a certainty of the second answer candidate based on second information that indicates a relation between a previously received device log and an answer that has been provided in response to an inquiry including the device log, and determining an answer to the new inquiry statement based on the first answer candidate, the first degree of certainty, the second answer candidate, and the second degree of certainty.
