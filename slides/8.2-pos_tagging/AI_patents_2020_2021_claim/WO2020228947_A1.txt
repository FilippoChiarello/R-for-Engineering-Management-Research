ELECTRONIC DEVICE, SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PREDICTING THE PERFORMANCE OF AN INDIVIDUAL HUMAN DURING A VISUAL PERCEPTION TASK
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to an electronic device (1) for predicting the visual perceptual task performance of an individual human. The electronic device is configured to: • receive an output of a first sensor device configured to measure the working memory load at the frontal cortex of the human, and • predict the visual perceptual task performance as a function of said sensor output. The invention further relates to a system and a method.

<claims>
1. An electronic device (1) predicting the visual perceptual task performance of an individual human, configured to:
receive an output of a first sensor device configured to measure the working memory load at the frontal cortex of the human,
predict the visual perceptual task performance as a function of said sensor output.
2. The electronic device (1) according to claim 1, wherein
the first sensor device comprises at least one functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) sensor configured to be placeabie in the human's head, specifically on the frontal part of the cortex.
3. The electronic device (1) according to claim 1 or 2, wherein measuring the working memory load comprises measuring a change of concentration levels of oxygenated (Hb02) and/or deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb)) elicited by neuronal activation in the underlying brain tissue at the frontal cortex of the human.
4. The electronic device (1) according to any one of the preceding claims, configured to predict a decrease of the visual perceptual task performance, in case the measured working memory load increases.
5. The electronic device (1) according to any one of the preceding claims, configured to
receive data records representing a perceptual load of a visual and dynamic scene perceivable by the human, and
predict the visual perceptual task performance additionally as a function of said data records.
6. The electronic device (1) according to the preceding claim, configured to predict a decrease of the visual perceptual task performance, in case the measured working memory load increases and at the same time the perceptual load does not increase. 7. A system (10, 30) for predicting the visual perceptual task performance of an individual human, comprising:
a sensor system (3, 5) configured to produce data records of working memory load of at the frontal cortex of the human and/or of perceptual load values of a visual and dynamic scene perceivable by the human, and
an electronic device (1) according to the preceding claims.
8. The system according to the preceding claim, wherein
the sensor system comprises:
a first sensor device (5) configured to measure the working memory load at the frontal cortex of the human, and/or
a second sensor device (3) configured to sense the perceptual load of a visual and dynamic scene perceivable by the human.
9. The system according to any one of the preceding claims 10 and 11, wherein
the second sensor device comprises a scene sensor (3) sensing the visual scene and is configured to:
extract a set of scene features (102) from the sensor output (101), the set of scene features (102) representing static and/or dynamic information of the visual scene, and
determine the perceptual load (104) of the set of extracted scene features (102) based on a predetermined load model (103), wherein
the load model (103) is predetermined based on reference video scenes each being labelled with a load value.
10. The system according to any one of the preceding claims 10 to 12, wherein
the load model (103) comprises a mapping function between sets of scene features extracted from the reference video scenes and the load values, and/or the load model (103) is configured to map a set of scene features to a perceptual load value.
11. The system according to any one of the preceding claims 10 to 13, wherein
the load model (103) is a regression model and/or a classification model between the sets of scene features extracted from the reference video scenes and the load values.
12. A vehicle (10) comprising:
an electronic device (1) according to any one of the preceding claims 1-6, or a system according to any one of the preceding claims 7-11.
13. A method of predicting the visual perceptual task performance of an individual human, comprising the steps of:
receiving an output of a first sensor device configured to measure the working memory load at the frontal cortex of the human, and
predicting the visual perceptual task performance as a function of said sensor output.
