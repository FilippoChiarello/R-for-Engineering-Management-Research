SYSTEM TO CONVERT CELLULOSIC MATERIALS INTO SUGAR AND METHOD OF USING THE SAME
</title>

<abstract>
A system configured to convert cellulosic materials to sugar is provided. The system has a housing a plurality of sensors coupled to the housing configured to receive input from an internal section of the housing, and convert the input to data during operation, and a control system comprising a processor, the control system configured to configured to adjust a parameter of the housing based on the received data, wherein the received data comprises an amount of oxygen within the housing, and if the oxygen in the housing is outside a predetermined range, the control system outputs a signal to an outlet to release a predetermined amount of oxygen.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A device configured to convert cellulosic materials to sugar, the device comprising: a housing having at least a flight disposed therein, the housing having a steam inlet and a vacuum inlet; a plurality of sensors coupled to the housing configured to receive input from an internal section of the housing, and convert the input to data during operation; and a control system comprising a processor, the control system configured to configured to adjust a parameter of the housing based on the received data; wherein the received data comprises an amount of oxygen within the housing, and if the oxygen in the housing is outside a predetermined range, the control system outputs a signal to an outlet to release a predetermined amount of oxygen.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of sensors comprises at least one pressure sensor.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of sensors comprises at least one temperature sensor, wherein the at least one temperature sensor is a thermocouple and is further configured to output a signal to the control system if the pH is outside of a predetermined range.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of sensors comprises a pH meter configured to calculate the hydrogen-ion activity of the products in the housing, and further configured to output a signal to the control system if the temperature is outside of a predetermined range.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of sensors comprises an oxygen sensor configured to calculate the oxygen content in the housing, and further configured to output a signal to the control system if the oxygen is outside of a predetermined range.
6. The system of claim 5, further comprising a carbon dioxide inlet coupled to the housing and a carboned dioxide source, the carbon dioxide being added to create carbonic acid and in turn, enhances a conversion of cellulose to sugar.
7. The system of claim 5, wherein if the if the oxygen sensor detects oxygen in the housing and communicates to the outlet to release the same via the control system, the control system is configured to, via CO2 inlet, automatically add protective inert CO2 gas to the housing.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of sensors comprises a moisture sensor configured to calculate the moisture of the products in the housing, and further configured to output a signal to the control system if the moisture is outside of a predetermined range.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein as moisture is consumed to produce the sugar, the moisture sensor and control system are configured to ensure that the moisture level remain at a predetermined optimal level for sugar output using a steam inlet to disperse steam into the housing.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of sensors comprises an infrared detector configured to monitor a content of a material within the housing.
11. The system of claim 1, further comprising: a feedstock inlet disposed on the housing; and a feedstock outlet disposed on the housing; wherein each of the inlet and outlet are configured to draw cellulosic material into the housing and to evacuate a sugar out of the housing, respectively using a vacuum system that creates positive and negative pressure in the housing.
12. The system of claim 1, further comprising a heating element, cooling element, or both, positioned proximate the housing.
13. The system of claim 1, further comprising a gear and a motor coupled to the housing and configured to provide a motive force to rotate the housing.
14. The system of claim 1, further comprising a bearing coupled to a shaft, the shaft being attached to the housing.
15. A method for to optimizing conversion of a cellulosic material to sugar in a mill, the mill comprising housing and plurality of sensors, the method comprising: providing a flight within the flight, the flight configured to agitate a plurality of bearings in the housing; sensing an amount of oxygen within the housing, and if the oxygen in the housing is outside a predetermined range, outputting a signal to an outlet to release a predetermined amount of oxygen; adding a predetermined amount of CO2 to optimize the reaction if the amount of oxygen is under a predetermined threshold to optimize the conversion
