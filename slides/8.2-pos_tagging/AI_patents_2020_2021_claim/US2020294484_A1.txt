VOICE SYNTHESIS METHOD, VOICE SYNTHESIS APPARATUS, AND RECORDING MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
Voice synthesis method and apparatus generate second control data using an intermediate trained model with first input data including first control data designating phonetic identifiers, change the second control data in accordance with a first user instruction provided by a user, generate synthesis data representing frequency characteristics of a voice to be synthesized using a final trained model with final input data including the first control data and the changed second control data, and generate a voice signal based on the generated synthesis data.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented voice synthesis method comprising: generating second control data using an intermediate trained model with first input data including first control data designating phonetic identifiers; changing the second control data in accordance with a first user instruction provided by a user; generating synthesis data representing frequency characteristics of a voice to be synthesized using a final trained model with final input data including the first control data and the changed second control data; and generating a voice signal based on the generated synthesis data.
2. The voice synthesis method according to claim 1, wherein: the intermediate trained model is a first trained model configured to generate the second control data according to the first input data, and the second control data represents phonemes of the voice to be synthesized.
3. The voice synthesis method according to claim 2, further comprising: generating third control data representing expressions of the voice to be synthesized using a second trained model with second input data including the first control data and the changed second control data; and changing the third control data in accordance with a second user instruction provided by the user, wherein the final input data further includes the changed third control data.
4. The voice synthesis method according to claim 1, wherein the second control data represents phonemes and expressions of the voice to be synthesized.
5. The voice synthesis method according to claim 1, further comprising: changing the synthesis data in accordance with a third user instruction provided by the user, wherein the generating of the voice signal includes generating the voice signal according to the changed synthesis data.
6. A voice synthesis apparatus comprising: a memory storing machine instructions; at least one processor that implements the machine instructions to execute a plurality of tasks, including: a first generating task that generates second control data using an intermediate trained model with first input data including first control data designating phonetic identifiers; a first changing task that changes the second control data in accordance with a first user instruction provided by a user; a second generating task that generates synthesis data representing frequency characteristics of a voice to be synthesized using a final trained model with final input data including the first control data and the changed second control data; and a third generating task that generates a voice signal based on the generated synthesis data.
7. A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium storing a program executable by a computer to perform a voice synthesis method comprising: generating second control data using an intermediate trained model with first input data including first control data designating phonetic identifiers; changing the second control data in accordance with a first user instruction provided by a user; generating synthesis data representing frequency characteristics of a voice to be synthesized using a final trained model with final input data including the first control data and the changed second control data; and generating a voice signal based on the generated synthesis data.
