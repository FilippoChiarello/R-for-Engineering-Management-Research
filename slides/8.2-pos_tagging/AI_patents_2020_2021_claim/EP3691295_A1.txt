ON-SITE, CUSTOM FITTED HEARING EQUALIZER
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a modular audio processing apparatus comprising: a shaped ear module (12A, D) comprising a receiver module (12C); an electronics module (12B) coupled to the receiver module (12C) and comprising digital signal processing circuits (12b); and a microphone module (14A) carried on the apparatus for receiving environmental sounds, wherein the digital signal processing circuits (12b) execute a hearing loss test protocol to carry out a hearing assessment on a user; wherein during the hearing assessment, a level of the environmental sounds received by the microphone module (14A) is monitored for determination as to whether an environment is suitable for assessment of the user's hearing limitations; wherein equalization and amplification levels of the audio processing apparatus are set for use in a normal mode of operation as an assistive listening device based on the hearing assessment.

<claims>
1. A modular audio processing apparatus comprising: a shaped ear module (12A, D) comprising a receiver module (12C); an electronics module (12B) coupled to the receiver module (12C) and comprising digital signal processing circuits (12b); and a microphone module (14A) carried on the apparatus for receiving environmental sounds, wherein the digital signal processing circuits (12b) execute a hearing loss test protocol to carry out a hearing assessment on a user; wherein during the hearing assessment, a level of the environmental sounds received by the microphone module (14A) is monitored for determination as to whether an environment is suitable for assessment of the user's hearing limitations; wherein equalization and amplification levels of the audio processing apparatus are set for use in a normal mode of operation as an assistive listening device based on the hearing assessment.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 further comprises a short-range wireless transceiver (12a) coupled to the electronics module (12B) and coupled to the digital signal processing circuits (12b), the short-range wireless transceiver (12a) providing for wireless communication with a wireless transceiver of a control unit (30);
wherein the control unit (30) comprises a hearing loss testing expert system.
3. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the hearing assessment is accomplished through generating sounds via an algorithm that determines hearing level of the user.
4. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the hearing assessment is accomplished by user indication that the generated sounds are heard by the user.
5. The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising a pass-through mode of operation that provides amplification of sound from the microphone module (14A);
wherein the digital signal processing circuits (12b) compensate for attenuation of incoming audio caused by insertion of the ear module (12A) in the user's ear canal.
6. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the electronics module (12B) is configured for placement behind the user's ear; and further wherein electronics module (12B) is coupled to the receiver module (12C) via a tube (15).
7. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the tube (15) is adjustable in length and lockable, the tube providing an adjustable length interconnection between the electronics module (12B) and the receiver module (12C).
8. An audio processing system comprising: A control unit (30); A modular audio processing apparatus, including: a shaped ear module (12A, D); a microphone module (14A) to receive environmental sounds; and an electronics module (12B) including digital signal processing circuits (12b) operable to process the environmental sounds received from the microphone module (14A) and transmit the environmental sounds to the control unit (30), wherein the control unit (30) includes a hearing-loss testing expert system for performing a hearing assessment of a user, and in response to the control unit (30) receiving the environmental sounds from the electronics module (12B), the hearing-loss testing expert system is configured to compensate the hearing assessment of the user according to the environmental sounds.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the hearing assessment is accomplished through generating sounds via an algorithm that determines hearing level of the user.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the hearing assessment is accomplished by user indication that the generated sounds are heard by the user.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the control unit (30) is at least one of a personal digital assistant (PDA), a cell phone, and a computer.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the control unit (30) is remote from the modular audio processing apparatus.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the modular audio processing apparatus further comprises a short-range wireless transceiver (12a) coupled the electronics module (12B); and further wherein the modular audio processing apparatus transmits the environmental sounds to the control unit (30) via the short-range wireless transceiver (12a).
14. A method for audio processing comprising: receiving, by a microphone module (14A) of a modular audio processing apparatus, environmental sounds; monitoring a level of the environmental sounds; determining whether an environment is suitable for assessment of a user's hearing limitations based upon the monitored level of the environmental sounds; executing a hearing loss test protocol to carry out a hearing assessment of the user; setting equalization and amplification levels of the audio processing apparatus for use in a normal mode of operation as an assistive listening device based upon the hearing assessment.
15. The method of claim 14 further comprising: providing a short-range wireless transceiver (12a) on the modular audio processing apparatus, and providing wireless communication between the modular audio processing apparatus and a wireless transceiver of a control unit (30) for controlling the hearing assessment through the modular audio processing apparatus by execution of a hearing loss testing expert system.
