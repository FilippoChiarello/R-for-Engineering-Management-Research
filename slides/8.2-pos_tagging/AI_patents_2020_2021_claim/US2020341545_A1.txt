<title>
Compensating for High Head Movement in Head-Mounted Displays
</title>

<abstract>
When the speed of head movement exceeds the processing capability of the system, a reduced depiction is displayed. As one example, the resolution may be reduced using coarse pixel shading in order to create a new depiction at the speed of head movement. In accordance with another embodiment, only the region the user is looking at is processed in full resolution and the remainder of the depiction is processed at lower resolution. In still another embodiment, the background depictions may be blurred or grayed out to reduce processing time.

<claims>
1. A smart phone comprising: a system on chip (SoC) comprising: an integrated circuit die having: a central processing unit (CPU) comprising a first plurality of cores including a first core and a second core; a graphics processing unit (GPU) coupled to the CPU, the GPU comprising a second plurality of cores; and a shared cache memory; a non-transitory storage medium coupled to the SoC, the non-transitory storage medium comprising instructions that when executed: cause the CPU to identify a first portion of a frame and a second portion of the frame, based at least in part on information from an application programming interface (API); and cause the GPU to: render the first portion of the frame at a first resolution, including to apply a first shading rate within the first portion of the frame; and render the second portion of the frame at a second resolution lower than the first resolution, including to apply a second shading rate within at least the second portion of the frame, wherein the first shading rate is twice the second shading rate; one or more cameras coupled to the SoC; at least one wireless interface; and a display comprising a touchscreen.
2. The smart phone of claim 1, further comprising at least one accelerometer.
3. The smart phone of claim 1, wherein the SoC comprises at least one accelerator.
4. The smart phone of claim 1, wherein the at least one wireless interface comprises a Wi-Fi interface and a Bluetooth interface.
5. The smart phone of claim 1, wherein the SoC is to execute a neural engine.
6. The smart phone of claim 1, wherein the at least one of the second plurality of cores is to render the first portion of the frame at the first resolution, the first resolution comprising a full resolution.
7. The smart phone of claim 1, wherein the at least one of the second plurality of cores is to render the first portion of the frame and render the second portion of the frame, the first portion of the frame comprising a foreground region, and the second portion of the frame comprising a background region.
8. The smart phone of claim 1, further comprising an interface to communicate with a headset.
9. The smart phone of claim 8, wherein the interface is to receive motion tracking information from the headset.
10. A tablet comprising: a processor comprising: a central processing unit (CPU) comprising a first plurality of cores including a first core and a second core; a graphics processing unit (GPU) coupled to the CPU, the GPU comprising a second plurality of cores; and a shared cache memory; a non-transitory storage medium coupled to the processor, the non-transitory storage medium comprising instructions that when executed: cause the CPU to identify a first portion of a frame and a second portion of the frame, based at least in part on information from an application programming interface (API); and cause the GPU to: render the first portion of the frame at a first resolution, including to apply a first shading rate within the first portion of the frame; and render the second portion of the frame at a second resolution lower than the first resolution, including to apply a second shading rate within at least the second portion of the frame, wherein the first shading rate is twice the second shading rate; at least one wireless interface; and a display comprising a touchscreen.
11. The tablet of claim 10, further comprising at least one accelerometer.
12. The tablet of claim 10, wherein the processor comprises at least one accelerator.
13. The tablet of claim 10, wherein the at least one wireless interface comprises a Wi-Fi interface and a Bluetooth interface.
14. The tablet of claim 10, wherein the at least one of the second plurality of cores is to render the first portion of the frame at the first resolution, the first resolution comprising a full resolution.
15. The tablet of claim 10, wherein the at least one of the second plurality of cores is to render the first portion of the frame and render the second portion of the frame, the first portion of the frame comprising a foreground region, and the second portion of the frame comprising a background region.
16. A non-transitory storage medium comprising instructions that when executed by a machine cause the machine to: identify a first portion of a frame and a second portion of the frame, based at least in part on information from an application programming interface (API); render the first portion of the frame at a first resolution, including to apply a first shading rate within the first portion of the frame; and render the second portion of the frame at a second resolution lower than the first resolution, including to apply a second shading rate within at least the second portion of the frame, wherein the first shading rate is at least twice the second shading rate.
17. The non-transitory storage medium of claim 16, further comprising instructions that when executed cause the machine to render the first portion of the frame at the first resolution, the first resolution comprising a full resolution.
18. The non-transitory storage medium of claim 16, further comprising instructions that when executed cause the machine to render the first portion of the frame and render the second portion of the frame, the first portion of the frame comprising a foreground region, and the second portion of the frame comprising a background region.
