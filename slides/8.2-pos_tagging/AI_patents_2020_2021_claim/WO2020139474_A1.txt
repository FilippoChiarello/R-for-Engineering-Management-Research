REAL-TIME MESSAGING IN A SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCING NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for transmitting real-time messages within a supply chain financing (SCF) network using a using a customized and improved messaging protocol is provided. A computing device receives a SCF request message having an SCF messaging protocol including a plurality of data fields including SCF request data related to a request for supply chain financing including an early payment identifier, parses the SCF request message based upon the SCF messaging protocol, selects a financing entity for receiving the request, stores within the memory device the SCF request data, transmits an early payment message having the same messaging protocol to the selected financing entity, receives a confirmation message having the same SCF messaging protocol from the financing entity including a plurality of data fields including SCF confirmation data, and stores within the memory device the SCF confirmation data with the SCF request data.
