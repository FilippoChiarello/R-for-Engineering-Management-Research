Method and apparatus for detecting lane line, and medium
</title>

<abstract>
According to the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, a method and apparatus for detecting a lane line, and a medium are provided. A method for generating a lane line detection model includes: detecting a lane line in an original image to generate a first image associated with the detected lane line; acquiring a second image generated based on the original image and associated with a marked lane line; generating at least one tag indicating whether the detected lane line is accurate, based on the first image and the second image; and training a classifier model for automatically identifying the lane line, based on the first image and the at least one tag. In such case, the lane line detection may be achieved in a simple and effective way.
