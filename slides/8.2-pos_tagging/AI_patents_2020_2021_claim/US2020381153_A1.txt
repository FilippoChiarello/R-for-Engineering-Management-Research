<title>
Truncated Flat Wire Coil
</title>

<abstract>
A flat wire coil lacking electrically insulating material on its upper and/or lower surfaces. The lack of insulating material aids in maintaining the coil temperature as well as providing other benefits.

<claims>
1. 1-16. (canceled)
17. A device comprising: a conductor having substantially rectangular cross section with a first pair of sides oriented substantially perpendicular to a plane of a coil and a second pair of sides oriented substantially parallel to a plane of the coil; and an electrically insulating material on at least one of the sides of the first pair of sides, at least one of the sides of the second pair of sides lacking any electrically insulating material.
18. The device of claim 17, wherein the coil is substantially circular.
19. The device of claim 17, wherein the coil has a racetrack shape.
20. The device of claim 17, wherein there is an electrically insulating material on both sides of the first pair of sides.
21. The device of claim 17, wherein there is no electrically insulating material on both sides of the second pair of sides.
22. An actuator comprising: a permanent magnet; and a device of flat wire, the flat wire including a conductor having substantially rectangular cross section with a first pair of sides oriented substantially perpendicular to a plane of the coil and a second pair of sides oriented substantially parallel to a plane of the coil and an electrically insulating material on at least one of the sides of the first pair of sides, at least one of the sides of the second pair of sides lacking any electrically insulating material, wherein the permanent magnet and the coil are arranged such that a force is developed between them in response to a current of sufficient magnitude passing through the coil.
23. A stage comprising: a table; and an actuator mechanically coupled to the table, the actuator including a permanent magnet and a device of flat wire, wherein the flat wire comprises: a conductor having substantially rectangular cross section with a first pair of sides oriented substantially perpendicular to a plane of a coil and a second pair of sides oriented substantially parallel to a plane of the coil, and an electrically insulating material on at least one of the sides of the first pair of sides, at least one of the sides of the second pair of sides lacking any electrically insulating material, wherein the permanent magnet and the coil are arranged such that a force is developed between them in response to a current of sufficient magnitude passing through the coil.
24. A method of making a coil comprising: providing a length of flat wire, the flat wire comprising a conductor having substantially rectangular cross section covered with an electrically insulating material; winding the length of flat wire into a device having a first substantially planar surface and a second substantially planar surface; and removing the electrically insulating material from at least a portion of the first substantially planar surface.
25. The method of claim 24, wherein the removing is carried out at least in part by machining.
26. The method of claim 24, wherein the removing is carried out at least in part by single point fly cutting.
27. The method of claim 24, wherein the removing is carried out at least in part by milling.
28. The method of claim 24, further comprising removing some of the conductor to regulate an electrical property of the coil after the removing of the electrically insulating material.
29. The method of claim 28, wherein the electrical property is resistance.
30. The method of claim 24, comprising measuring an electrical resistance of the coil after the removing of the electrically insulating material.
31. The method of claim 24, comprising measuring a Q factor of the coil after the removing of the electrically insulating material.
32. A method of making a coil comprising: providing a sheet of conductive material; covering at least one side of the sheet with a layer of an electrically insulating material; rolling the sheet and layer to form a roll; and cutting the roll transverse to a length of the roll to form a coil.
