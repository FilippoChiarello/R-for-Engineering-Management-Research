DATA CENTER USING A MEMORY POOL BETWEEN SELECTED MEMORY RESOURCES
</title>

<abstract>
Apparatuses, systems, and methods related to a data center using a memory pool between selected memory resources are described. A data center using a memory pool between selected memory resources may enable performance of functions, including automated functions critical for prevention of damage to product, personal safety, and/or reliable operation, based on increased access to data that may improve performance of a mission profile. For instance, a method described herein includes transmitting, from a processor at a first vehicle that comprises the processor and memory, a request to access a pool of memory resources configured from a plurality of vehicles each having a local processor and memory, receiving, from a second vehicle of the plurality of vehicles, an indication to access the pool of memory resources, and reading data from or writing data to the memory at the second vehicle using the processor at the first vehicle based at least in part on receiving the indication to access the pool of memory resources.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: requesting, from a first device that comprises a processor and memory, access to a pool of memory resources, wherein the pool of memory resources are located on a plurality of devices each having a local processor and memory; and accessing the memory at the second device using the processor at the first device based at least in part on receiving an indication from a second device to access the pool of memory resources.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: accessing the memory at a third device of the plurality of devices based at least in part on receiving the indication to access the pool of memory resources.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising relinquishing access to the pool of memory resources after reading data from or writing data to the memory at the second device.
4. The method of claim 1, further includes relinquishing access to the pool of memory resources in response to receiving an indication to access another pool of memory resources with a different plurality of resources.
5. The method of claim 1, further includes verifying the pool of memory resources is a trusted pool of memory resources, wherein trusted includes being secure and free of malware.
6. An apparatus, comprising: a first device, including a processor and memory resource, configured to: transmit a request to access a pool of memory resources configured from a plurality of devices each having a local processor and memory; receive, from a second device of the plurality of devices, an indication to access the pool of memory resources; and access the memory at the second device based at least in part on receiving the indication to access the pool of memory resources.
7. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the first device is located on an autonomous vehicle.
8. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the pool of memory resources is accessed wirelessly by the first device.
9. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the first device includes a transceiver to transmit and receive.
10. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the second device includes a transceiver to transmit the indication to access the pool of memory resources to the first device.
11. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the request to access the pool of memory resources is received by a transceiver of the second device.
12. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the request includes an address of the first device.
13. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the first device transmits a request to access the pool of memory resources in response to needing additional memory to perform an operation.
14. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the first device is further configured to read data from or write data to the memory at a third device.
15. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the pool of memory resources is further configured from a plurality of base stations each having a local processor and memory.
16. A system, comprising: a first pool of memory resources, wherein the first pool of memory resources are configured from a plurality of devices each having a local processor and memory; and a first device, comprising: a first processor configured to: request access to a particular amount of memory from the first pool of memory resources; and access the memory at the second device based at least in part on receiving an indication to access the first pool of memory resources in response to the first pool of memory resources having the particular amount of memory available.
17. The system of claim 16, further comprising a second pool of memory resources.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the first processor requests access to the first pool of memory resources in response to the first pool of memory resources being in closer proximity to the first device than the second pool of memory resources.
19. The system of claim 17, wherein the first processor requests access to the first pool of memory resources in response to the first pool of memory resources having more available memory than the second pool of memory resources.
20. The system of claim 17, wherein the first processor is further configured to receive access to the second pool of memory resources in response to the first pool of memory resources revoking access.
