<title>
Systems and methods to detect rare mutations and copy number variation
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides a system and method for the detection of rare mutations and copy number variations in cell free polynucleotides. Generally, the systems and methods comprise sample preparation, or the extraction and isolation of cell free polynucleotide sequences from a bodily fluid; subsequent sequencing of cell free polynucleotides by techniques known in the art; and application of bioinformatics tools to detect rare mutations and copy number variations as compared to a reference. The systems and methods also may contain a database or collection of different rare mutations or copy number variation profiles of different diseases, to be used as additional references in aiding detection of rare mutations, copy number variation profiling or general genetic profiling of a disease.

<claims>
1. A method for detecting a presence or absence of cancer, comprising: (a) tagging at least a portion of polynucleotides from a first sample from a subject with molecular barcodes to generate a first population of tagged parent polynucleotides; (b) amplifying at least a portion of the first population of tagged parent polynucleotides to generate a first population of amplified polynucleotides; (c) sequencing at least a portion of the first population of amplified polynucleotides, thereby providing sequence data; (d) repeating steps (a)-(c) with a second sample from the subject obtained at another time than the first sample; and (e) using the sequence data to assess whether the subject has cancer, wherein the polynucleotides from at least one of the first or second samples comprises cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) molecules.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein (e) comprises detecting a presence or absence of an abnormal change in an epigenetic pattern.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the first and second samples comprise cfDNA.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein one of the first or second samples is a tissue sample or tumor biopsy.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein at least one of the first or second samples is a blood sample.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the first and second samples are blood samples.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject has undergone a treatment for cancer between when the first and second samples were obtained from the subject.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the treatment for cancer is chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination therapy.
9. The method of claim 7, further comprising identifying, based on the sequence data from the first and second samples, a different cancer treatment for the subject than the treatment for cancer that was previously given to the subject between when the first and second samples were obtained from the subject.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the tagging is performed using blunt-end or sticky-end ligation.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the molecular barcodes are from a set of molecular barcodes comprising from 2 to 10,000 different molecular barcode sequences.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least a portion of polynucleotides from the first and second samples are non-uniquely tagged with molecular barcodes.
13. The method of claim 1, further comprising enriching the first population of amplified polynucleotides and the second population of amplified polynucleotides for target genomic regions of interest prior to sequencing.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the sequence data comprises sequencing reads of the first and second populations of amplified polynucleotides.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein (e) comprises mapping a plurality of the sequencing reads to a reference sequence.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein (e) further comprises identifying unique polynucleotides of the first sample or second sample from among a plurality of the sequencing reads using at least sequence data from the molecular barcodes.
17. The method of claim 16, further comprising detecting a presence or absence of a somatic genetic variant from among the sequence data of the unique polynucleotides.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the somatic genetic variant comprises a single nucleotide variation (SNV), an insertion or deletion (indel), a copy number variation (CNV), or a gene fusion.
19. The method of claim 17, further comprising determining that the subject has cancer based on one or more somatic genetic variants detected as present.
20. The method of claim 2, further comprising detecting a presence or absence of a somatic genetic variant.
