<title>
METHOD TO PREVENT ROOT LEVEL ACCESS ATTACK AND MEASURABLE SLA SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE PLATFORM
</title>

<abstract>
A compliance monitor measures metrics regarding one or more managed devices in a network. The compliance monitor generates a log based on the information detected by the measurement trackers and to transmit a report based on the generated log to a recipient. The compliance monitor also initiates one or more security actions based on the one or more measurement trackers indicating that a measured metric exceeds an associated threshold measurement value.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: one or more measurement trackers, the measurement trackers to measure metrics regarding one or more managed devices in a network; a logger to generate a log based on the information detected by the measurement trackers and to transmit a report based on the generated log to a recipient; and a non-compliance enforcer to initiate one or more security actions based on the one or more measurement trackers indicating that a measured metric exceeds an associated threshold measurement value.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more measurement trackers includes a mean time to detection tracker that tracks a mean time to a detection of a change at each of the one or more managed devices.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more measurement trackers includes a mean time to isolation tracker that tracks a mean time to an isolation of each managed device of the one or more managed devices when a change is detected at the managed device.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more measurement trackers includes a hacker investigation time tracker that tracks a time spent by a malicious attacker at a managed device of the one or more managed devices.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the managed device is a honeypot designed to provide dummy resources for a malicious attacker to access, the dummy resources being attractive to the malicious attacker.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more measurement trackers includes a mean time to repair tracker that tracks a mean time to repair a managed device of the one or more managed devices after a change is detected at the managed device.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more measurement trackers includes a mean time to service tracker that tracks a mean time to restore a service provided by the one or more managed devices in the network after a disruption of the service caused by a change detected at a managed device of the one or more managed devices.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more measurement trackers includes a time to compliance tracker that tracks a time for the measured metrics of the one or more managed devices to return to values that are within the threshold measurement values after one or more of the measured metrics exceeds their respective threshold measurement values.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the associated threshold measurement values are specified in a service level agreement for the system.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more security actions includes rolling back a state of a managed device to an earlier known good state when a measured metric for that managed device exceeds the associated threshold measurement value.
11. A method comprising: measuring metrics regarding one or more managed devices in a network using one or more measurement trackers; generating a log based on the information detected by the measurement trackers; transmitting a report based on the generated log to a recipient; and initiating one or more security actions based on the one or more measurement trackers indicating that a measured metric exceeds an associated threshold measurement value.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the one or more measurement trackers includes a mean time to detection tracker that tracks a mean time to a detection of change at each of the one or more managed devices.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the one or more measurement trackers includes a mean time to isolation tracker that tracks a mean time to an isolation of each managed device of the one or more managed devices when a change is detected at the managed device.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein the one or more measurement trackers includes a hacker investigation time tracker that tracks a time spent by a malicious attacker at a managed device of the one or more managed devices.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the managed device is a honeypot designed to provide dummy resources for a malicious attacker to access, the dummy resources being attractive to the malicious attacker.
16. The method of claim 11, wherein the one or more measurement trackers includes a mean time to repair tracker that tracks a mean time to repair a managed device of the one or more managed devices after a change is detected at the managed device.
17. The method of claim 11, wherein the one or more measurement trackers includes a mean time to service tracker that tracks a mean time to restore a service provided by the one or more managed devices in the network after a disruption of the service caused by a change detected at a managed device of the one or more managed devices.
18. The method of claim 11, wherein the one or more measurement trackers includes a time to compliance tracker that tracks a time for the measured metrics of the one or more managed devices to return to values that are within the threshold measurement values after one or more of the measured metrics exceeds their respective threshold measurement values.
19. The method of claim 11, wherein the associated threshold measurement values are specified in a service level agreement for the system.
20. The method of claim 11, wherein the one or more security actions includes rolling back a state of a managed device to an earlier known good state when a measured metric for that managed device exceeds the associated threshold measurement value.
