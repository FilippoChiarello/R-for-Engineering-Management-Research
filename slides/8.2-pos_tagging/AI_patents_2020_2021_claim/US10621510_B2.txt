<title>
Hybrid blockchain data architecture for use within a cognitive environment
</title>

<abstract>
A data architecture for use within a cognitive information processing system environment comprising: a plurality of data sources, the plurality of data sources comprising a public data source and a private data source, the public source comprising a public blockchain data source, the private data source comprising a private blockchain data source; a cognitive data management module, the cognitive data management module accessing information from the plurality of data sources, the information comprising public blockchain information and private blockchain information; and, providing the information to a cognitive inference and learning system.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A cognitive information processing system environment comprising: a plurality of data sources, the plurality of data sources comprising a public data source and a private data source, the public data source comprising publicly available information, at least some of the publicly available information being maintained within a public blockchain knowledge repository, the private data source comprising privately managed, company specific information at least some of the privately managed, company specific information being maintained within a private blockchain knowledge repository; a first cognitive inference and learning system, the cognitive inference and learning system providing a cognitive computing function, the first cognitive inference and learning system comprising a hosted cognitive platform executing on a first information processing system, the hosted cognitive platform and the information processing system performing a first cognitive computing function, the hosted cognitive platform comprising a hosted cognitive engine, the hosted cognitive engine comprising a hosted dataset engine, a hosted graph query engine and a hosted insight engine, the hosted dataset engine being implemented to establish and maintain a dynamic data ingestion and enrichment pipeline, the hosted graph query engine being implemented to receive and process queries such that the queries are bridged into a hosted cognitive graph, the hosted insight engine being implemented to generate a hosted cognitive insight from the cognitive graph, the hosted dataset engine, the hosted graph query engine and the hosted insight engine operating collaboratively to generate the hosted cognitive insight; and, a hosted cognitive repository, the hosted cognitive repository storing the publicly available information, the hosted cognitive repository comprising the hosted cognitive graph; a second cognitive inference and learning system, the second cognitive inference and learning system providing a cognitive computing function, the second cognitive inference and learning system comprising a private cognitive platform executing on a private information processing system, the private cognitive platform and the private information processing system performing a second cognitive computing function, the private cognitive platform comprising a private cognitive engine, the private cognitive engine comprising a private dataset engine, a private graph query engine and a private insight engine, the private dataset engine being implemented to establish and maintain a dynamic data ingestion and enrichment pipeline, the private graph query engine being implemented to receive and process queries such that the queries are bridged into a private cognitive graph, the private insight engine being implemented to generate a private cognitive insight from the private cognitive graph, the private dataset engine, the private graph query engine and the private insight engine operating collaboratively to generate the private cognitive insight; and, a private network repository, the private network repository storing the privately managed company specific information, the private network repository comprising the private cognitive graph; and, a cognitive cloud management module, the cognitive cloud management module accessing information from the plurality of data sources and providing the information to the first cognitive inference and learning system and the second cognitive inference and learning system, the information comprising public blockchain information from the public blockchain knowledge repository and private blockchain information from the private blockchain knowledge repository, the hosted cognitive platform processing data from the public data source, the private cognitive platform processing data from the private data source, the private cognitive platform interacting with the hosted cognitive platform to provide private cognitive insights.
2. The data architecture of claim 1, wherein: the private data source comprises information accessible via a private network of a company.
3. The data architecture of claim 2, wherein: the private network of the company comprises the private cognitive platform, the private cognitive platform being an on-site cognitive platform, the private cognitive platform being located within and executing on the private network of the company.
4. The data architecture of claim 3, wherein: the private network comprises a private application, the private application providing information to and receiving information from the on-site cognitive platform, the private application comprising an industry specific application.
