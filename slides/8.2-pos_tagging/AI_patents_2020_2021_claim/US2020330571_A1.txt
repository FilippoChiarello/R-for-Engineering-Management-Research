<claims>
1. An aqueous pharmaceutical composition comprising: (a) an aqueous component, comprising: (i) water; (ii) a pH modifier, wherein the pH modifier is a base; (iii) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier comprises dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), wherein the DMSO is present at a concentration of 1-4%; and (iv) a tonicity adjusting agent; and (b) at least one peptide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein each of the peptides or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof is (i) soluble in the aqueous component; (ii) present in the pharmaceutical composition at an amount of from 50 μg to 1.5 mg; and (iii) has a length of from 8 to 50 naturally occurring amino acids.
2. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the at least one peptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof comprises at least two peptides or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
3. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the at least one peptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof have a hydrophobic fraction of less than 0.45, wherein the hydrophobic fraction is the total number of hydrophobic amino acids in a peptide divided by the total number of amino acids in the peptide, wherein the hydrophobic amino acids are alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, phenylalanine and tryptophan.
4. (canceled)
5. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the at least one peptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof are stable for 24 weeks at −20° C.
6. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein one or more of the at least one peptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof has a length of from 15 to 35 amino acids in length.
7. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the pH modifier is a dicarboxylate salt or a tricarboxylate salt.
8. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the pH modifier is succinic acid or a succinate salt.
9. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the pH modifier is citric acid or a citrate salt.
10. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 8, wherein the pH modifier is sodium succinate.
11. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 8, wherein the succinic acid or succinate salt is present in the pharmaceutical composition at a concentration from 1 mM to 10 mM.
12. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 8, wherein the succinic acid or succinate salt is present in the pharmaceutical composition at a concentration of 2 mM to 5 mM.
13. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier comprises water.
14. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the tonicity adjusting agent comprises dextrose.
15. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the tonicity adjusting agent comprises trehalose.
16. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the tonicity adjusting agent comprises sucrose.
17. (canceled)
18. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the pharmaceutical composition is lyophilizable.
19. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the pharmaceutical composition further comprises an immunomodulator or an adjuvant.
