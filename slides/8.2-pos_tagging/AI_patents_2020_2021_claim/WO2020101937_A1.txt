<title>
DYNAMIC SOUND EMISSION FOR VEHICLES
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle computing system may implement techniques to dynamically adjust a volume and/or frequency of a sound emitted from a vehicle to warn an object ( e.g., dynamic object) of a potential conflict with the vehicle. The techniques may include determining a baseline noise level and/or frequencies proximate to the object. The baseline noise level and/or frequencies may be determined based on an identification of one or more noise generating objects in the environment. The vehicle computing system may determine the volume and/or a frequency of the sound based in part on the baseline noise level and/or frequencies, an urgency of the warning, a probability of conflict between the vehicle and the object, a speed of the object, etc.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A system comprising:
a sensor coupled to a vehicle;
a speaker coupled to the vehicle;
one or more processors; and
one or more computer-readable media storing instructions that, when executed, configure the system to:
identify, based on sensor data from the sensor, an object in an environment associated with the vehicle;
determine a noise level proximate to the object, wherein the noise level is based at least in part on noise events generated by one or more other objects located within a threshold distance of the object; determine, based at least in part on the noise level, at least one of a volume or a frequency of a sound to emit; and
emit, via the speaker, the sound at the at least one of the volume or the frequency.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the instructions further cause the system to:
determine a first range of frequencies corresponding to the noise events generated by the other objects, wherein the frequency is based at least in part on the first range of frequencies.
3. The system of either claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the at least one of the volume or the frequency are determined based at least in part on at least one of:
a first perceived noise level by the object of a first noise emitted by a first noise generating object; or a second perceived noise level by the object of a second noise emitted by a second noise generating object,
wherein the first perceived noise level and the second perceived noise level are determined based at least in part on at least one of:
accessing machine learned outputs of noises emitted by identified objects proximate to the object; or
accessing a database of noises emitted from noise generating objects.
4. The system of any one of claims 1-3, wherein the sound is emitted in a beam formed audio signal directed toward the object.
5. The system of any one of claims 1-4, wherein the instructions further cause the system to:
determine, based on the sensor data, a first trajectory associated with the vehicle;
determine, based on the sensor data, a second trajectory associated with the object;
determine a potential conflict between the vehicle and the object based on the first trajectory and the second trajectory;
determine an action to take to avoid the potential conflict; and
cause the vehicle to take the action.
6. A computer-implemented method comprising:
identifying, based on sensor data from a sensor associated with a vehicle, an object in an environment associated with the vehicle;
determining a noise level proximate to the object;
determining, based at least in part on the noise level proximate to the object, at least one of a volume or a frequency of a sound to emit; and
causing the sound to be emitted via a speaker at the at least one of the volume or the frequency.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 6, wherein the noise level is based on noise events generated within a threshold distance of the object, the computer-implemented method further comprising: determining a first range of frequencies corresponding to the noise level proximate to the object, wherein the frequency is based at least in part on the first range of frequencies.
8. The computer-implemented method of either claim 6 or claim 7, wherein the object is a first object, the computer-implemented method further comprising:
identifying a second object,
wherein determining the volume of the sound to emit is based at least in part on the second object.
9. The computer-implemented method of any one of claims 6-8, further comprising:
determining a speed of the vehicle traveling through the environment,
wherein determining the at least one of the volume or the frequency is based at least in part on the speed of the vehicle.
10. The computer-implemented method of any one of claims 6-9, further comprising:
determining a trajectory associated with the object; and
determining, based at least in part on the trajectory, a probability that the object will be within a threshold distance of the vehicle at a future time,
wherein determining the at least one of the volume or the frequency of the sound to emit is based at least in part on the probability.
11. The computer-implemented method of claim 10, further comprising:
determining a change in the trajectory associated with the object;
determining, based at least in part on the change in the trajectory, to stop emitting the sound via the speaker.
12. The computer-implemented method of any one of claims 6-11, wherein determining the at least one of the volume or the frequency is based in part on at least one of:
an occupancy of the vehicle;
a road condition;
a location of the vehicle in the environment;
a speed of the vehicle in the environment;
a time of day in which the vehicle is operating;
a day in a week in which the vehicle is operating; or
a weather condition in the environment.
13. The computer-implemented method of any one of claims 6-12, further comprising:
determining a first trajectory associated with the object at a first time, wherein the first trajectory corresponds to a potential conflict between the vehicle and the object;
determining a second trajectory associated with the object at a second time;
determining that a difference between the first trajectory and the second trajectory is less than a threshold value;
determining at least one of a second volume or a second frequency of a second sound to emit based at least in part on the difference between the first trajectory and the second trajectory being less than the threshold value; and
causing the second sound to be emitted via the speaker at the at least one of the second volume or the second frequency.
14. The computer-implemented method of any one of claims 6-13, further comprising:
identify a classification associated with the object,
wherein determining the at least one of the volume or the frequency of the sound to emit is based at least in part on the classification associated with the object.
15. A vehicle comprising :
a sensor;
a speaker;
one or more processors; and
one or more computer-readable media storing instructions that, when executed, configure the vehicle to perform a computer-implemented method of any one of claims 6-14.
