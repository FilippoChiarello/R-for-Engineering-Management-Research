BREACH RESPONSE DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for security incident response management are disclosed. A method includes receiving a cyber event; identifying a playbook of tasks, where the playbook constitutes a response to the cyber event, and where a task of the tasks is assignable to a user group; receiving, from a user of the user group, a completion of the task; receiving a proof of completion of the task; and generating an compliance report including the task and the proof of completion.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for responding to cyber events, comprising:
receiving a cyber event;
identifying a playbook of tasks,
wherein the playbook constitutes a response to the cyber event, and wherein a task of the tasks is assignable to a user group;
receiving, from a user of the user group, a completion of the task;
receiving a proof of completion of the task; and
generating a compliance report including the task and the proof of completion.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the user is an automated agent.
3. The method of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein receiving the cyber event comprises:
receiving, from a configuration management system, asset information for an asset; identifying, using at least one of the asset information or the asset, a violated policy; and
identifying the cyber event in response to identifying the violated policy.
4. The method of claim 1 or claim 2 , wherein receiving the cyber event comprises:
receiving an intelligence feed;
identifying an asset in a configuration management database based on the intelligence feed; and
identifying the cyber event based on the asset.
5. The method of any of claims 1 to 4, further comprising:
receiving an intelligence feed; and
associating an intelligence report, from the intelligence feed, with the playbook.
6. The method of any of claims 1 to 5, further comprising:
receiving a first document constituting an authority;
creating one or more playbooks of tasks based on the first document; receiving a second document constituting a revision of the authority; identifying differences between the first document and the second document; and based on the differences, updating at least one of the one or more playbooks of tasks.
7. The method of any of the preceding claims, where the cyber event is received from at least one of a configuration management system, a change management system, a records management system, or a security information and event management system.
8. A method for responding to cyber events, comprising:
receiving, from a user, an incident of a cyber event;
identifying, based on the incident, tasks, wherein a task of the tasks is assignable to a user group;
receiving, from a user of the user group, a completion of the task; and
receiving a proof of completion of the task.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the proof of completion of the task is received from the user.
10. The method of claim 8 or claim 9, further comprising:
generating a compliance report including the task and the proof of completion.
11. The method of any of claims 8 to 10, wherein identifying, based on the incident, the tasks comprising:
determining a violated authority based on the incident; and
identifying the tasks based on the violated authority.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the violated authority is one of a regulation, a policy, an IT control, or a contractual obligation.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the violated authority is a contractual obligation, and the method further comprising:
receiving a contract document from a procurement system; and
associating a playbook with the contractual obligation in response to an analysis of the contract document.
14. The method of any of claims 8 to 13, comprising:
receiving a first document constituting an authority;
creating one or more playbooks of tasks based on the first document;
receiving a second document constituting a revision of the authority;
identifying differences between the first document and the second document; and based on the differences, updating at least one of the one or more playbooks of tasks.
15. A system for responding to cyber events, comprising:
a memory; and
a processor, the processor configured to execute instructions stored in the memory to: receive a cyber event;
identify a playbook of tasks,
wherein the playbook constitutes a response to the cyber event, and wherein a task of the tasks is assignable to a user;
receive, from the user, a completion of the task;
receive a proof of completion of the task; and
generate an compliance report including the task and the proof of completion.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the user is an automated agent.
17. The system of any of claim 15 or claim 16, wherein to receive the cyber event comprises to:
receive, from a configuration management system, asset information for an asset; identify, using at least one of the asset information or the asset, a violated policy; and identify the cyber event in response to identifying the violated policy.
18. The system of any of claims 15 to 17, wherein to receive the cyber event comprises to:
receive an intelligence feed;
identify an asset in a configuration management database based on the intelligence feed; and
identify the cyber event based on the asset.
19. The system of any of claims 15 to claim 18, wherein the instructions further comprise instructions to:
receive an intelligence feed; and
associate an intelligence report, from the intelligence feed, with the playbook.
20. The system of any of claims 15 to 19, where the cyber event is received from at least one of a configuration management system, a change management system, a records management system, or a security information and event management system.
21. A method for responding to cyber events, comprising:
receiving a first document constituting an authority;
creating one or more playbooks of tasks based on the first document, wherein a playbook of the one or more playbooks comprises tasks, and wherein at least some of the tasks are to be completed in response to a cyber event;
receiving a second document constituting a revision of the authority;
identifying differences between the first document and the second document; and based on the differences, updating at least one of the one or more playbooks of tasks.
