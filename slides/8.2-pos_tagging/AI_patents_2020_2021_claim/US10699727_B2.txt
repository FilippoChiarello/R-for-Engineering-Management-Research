<title>
Signal adaptive noise filter
</title>

<abstract>
Noise filtering for an incoming signal is provided. The noise filtering method includes executing a transformation operation on the incoming signal by distributing energy corresponding to each of a plurality of components of the incoming signal into a two-dimensional representation. The noise filtering method also includes executing a filtering operation on the plurality of components to determine real objects and remove noise within the incoming signal. The filtering operation utilizing at least one of a plurality of noise detection matrixes based on time, frequency, or direction.
