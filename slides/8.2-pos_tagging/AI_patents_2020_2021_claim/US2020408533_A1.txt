DEEP LEARNING-BASED DETECTION OF GROUND FEATURES USING A HIGH DEFINITION MAP
</title>

<abstract>
According to an aspect of an embodiment, operations may comprise accessing a map of a region. The map may comprise a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud comprising points of the region. Each of the points may comprise a pixel that comprises a red channel, a green channel, a blue channel, and intensity channel, and a height channel. The operations may also comprise identifying a set of points on the ground in the 3D point cloud. The operations may also comprise providing the set of points as input to a deep learning model. The operations may also comprise determining, using the deep learning model, whether each of the set of points is within a ground feature. The operations may also comprise storing, in the map, information regarding the ground feature in the map of the region.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method, comprising: accessing a map of a region, the map comprising a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud comprising points of the region, each of the points comprising a pixel that comprises a red channel, a green channel, a blue channel, and intensity channel, and a height channel; identifying a set of points on the ground in the 3D point cloud; providing the set of points as input to a deep learning model; determining, using the deep learning model, whether each of the set of points is within a ground feature; and storing, in the map, information regarding the ground feature in the map of the region.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the deep learning model is able to determine whether each of the set of points is within the ground feature more accurately with each pixel comprising the red channel, the green channel, the blue channel, the intensity channel, and the height channel than where each pixel only comprises the red channel, the green channel, and the blue channel.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the ground feature comprises a lane line.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the ground feature comprises a navigable boundary.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the ground feature comprises a crosswalk.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the ground feature comprises a sidewalk.
7. One or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media storing instructions that in response to being executed by one or more processors, cause a computer system to perform operations, the operations comprising: accessing a map of a region, the map comprising a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud comprising points of the region, each of the points comprising a pixel that comprises a red channel, a green channel, a blue channel, and intensity channel, and a height channel; identifying a set of points on the ground in the 3D point cloud; providing the set of points as input to a deep learning model; determining, using the deep learning model, whether each of the set of points is within a ground feature; and storing, in the map, information regarding the ground feature in the map of the region.
8. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media of claim 7, wherein the deep learning model is able to determine whether each of the set of points is within the ground feature more accurately with each pixel comprising the red channel, the green channel, the blue channel, the intensity channel, and the height channel than where each pixel only comprises the red channel, the green channel, and the blue channel.
9. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media of claim 7, wherein the ground feature comprises a lane line.
10. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media of claim 7, wherein the ground feature comprises a navigable boundary.
11. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media of claim 7, wherein the ground feature comprises a crosswalk.
12. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media of claim 7, wherein the ground feature comprises a sidewalk.
13. A computer system comprising: one or more processors; and one or more non-transitory computer readable media storing instructions that in response to being executed by the one or more processors, cause the computer system to perform operations, the operations comprising: accessing a map of a region, the map comprising a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud comprising points of the region, each of the points comprising a pixel that comprises a red channel, a green channel, a blue channel, and intensity channel, and a height channel; identifying a set of points on the ground in the 3D point cloud; providing the set of points as input to a deep learning model; determining, using the deep learning model, whether each of the set of points is within a ground feature; and storing, in the map, information regarding the ground feature in the map of the region.
14. The computer system of claim 13, wherein the deep learning model is able to determine whether each of the set of points is within the ground feature more accurately with each pixel comprising the red channel, the green channel, the blue channel, the intensity channel, and the height channel than where each pixel only comprises the red channel, the green channel, and the blue channel.
15. The computer system of claim 13, wherein the ground feature comprises a lane line.
16. The computer system of claim 13, wherein the ground feature comprises a navigable boundary.
17. The computer system of claim 13, wherein the ground feature comprises a crosswalk.
18. The computer system of claim 13, wherein the ground feature comprises a sidewalk.
