<title>
Natural Language Query Procedure Where Query is Ingested into a Cognitive Graph
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implementable method for managing a cognitive graph comprising: receiving data a data source, the data comprising a query and information relating to an answer to the query; processing the query, the processing the query identifying a plurality of query related knowledge elements; processing the information relating to the answer to the query, the processing the information relating to the answer to the query identifying a plurality of answer related knowledge elements; and, storing the plurality of query related knowledge elements and the plurality of answer related knowledge elements within the cognitive graph as a collection of knowledge elements.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. 1-6. (canceled)
7. A computer-implementable method for managing a cognitive graph of a universal knowledge repository comprising: receiving, by an information processing system, data from a data source, the data comprising of a query and information relating to an answer to the query; processing, by the information processing system, via a cognitive inference and learning system, the query, the processing of the query including identifying a plurality of query related knowledge elements and determining whether the query includes an ambiguity, the cognitive inference and learning system comprising a cognitive platform, the cognitive platform comprising a cognitive graph, the cognitive graph including integrated machine learning functionality having cognitive functionality, the cognitive functionality using extracted features of newly-observed data from user feedback received via an Application Program Interface during a learn phase to improve accuracy of knowledge stored within the cognitive graph, the learn phase including feedback on observations generated during a relate phase; performing, by the information processing system, parsing operations, the parsing operations generating a set of parse trees using a parse rule set, the mapping operations comprising mapping structural elements to resolve ambiguity, the mapping operations comprising mapping structural elements of the query around a verb of the query, the mapping of the structural elements transforming the structural elements into words higher up an inheritance chain within the cognitive graph, the parse tress being ranked by a conceptualization ranking rule set, the parse trees representing ambiguous portions of the text of the query; performing, by the information processing system, conceptualization operations, the conceptualization operations identifying relationships of concepts identified from ranking the set of parse trees using the conceptualization ranking rule set, the conceptualization operations generating a set of conceptualization ambiguity options, the set of conceptualization ambiguity options being ranked using the conceptualization ranking rule set, top-ranked conceptualization options being stored in the cognitive graph; processing, by the information processing system, the information relating to the answer to the query, the processing of the information relating to the answer to the query identifying a plurality of answers related the knowledge elements, the answers corresponding to top-ranked parse options of the ranked parse trees; storing, by the information processing system using a consistent, non-arbitrary, universally recognizable schema, the plurality of query related knowledge elements and the answers related knowledge elements within the cognitive graph as a collection of knowledge elements in a configuration representing relationship of concepts; submitting, by the information processing system, an insight agent query from an insight agent to the universal knowledge repository; and responsive to the submitted insight agent query, providing, by the information processing system based on a matching rule set and the answers related knowledge elements in the universal knowledge repository, matching results to the insight agent; and wherein any ambiguity identified when processing the query is stored within the cognitive graph as a query related knowledge element.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising: analyzing the query to determine whether the query contains text; and performing a natural language processing operation on the text.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein: the query related knowledge elements are stored within the cognitive graph as nodes; and subsets of nodes are related via edges.
