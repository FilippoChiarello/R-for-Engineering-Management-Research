</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods of dynamic searching, price comparison, and optimization utilizing novel search engines are provided. A search engine enables searching across multiple virtual private servers in a tailored group of geographical locations. Back-end architecture including one or more databases and tracking tools compares prices of a product or service in the tailored group of geographical locations. The system provides the lowest price for the product or service in the tailored group of geographical locations to a user in any geographical location. The search engine may be provided via a front-end mobile application. A user can drag a sticker icon over any search result to request price information for the product or service shown in the search result and be directed to a pop-up showing the price information for the product or service and/or a website providing the lowest price for the product or service. Disclosed systems and methods are particularly useful for people shopping for flights and other travel services.
