TRANSPOSITION OF NUCLEIC ACIDS INTO EUKARYOTIC GENOMES WITH A TRANSPOSASE FROM HELIOTHIS
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention provides polynucleotide vectors for high expression of heterologous genes. Some vectors further comprise novel transposons and transposases that further improve expression. Further disclosed are vectors that can be used in a gene transfer system for stably introducing nucleic acids into the DNA of a cell. The gene transfer systems can be used in methods, for example, gene expression, bioprocessing, gene therapy, insertional mutagenesis, or gene discovery.
