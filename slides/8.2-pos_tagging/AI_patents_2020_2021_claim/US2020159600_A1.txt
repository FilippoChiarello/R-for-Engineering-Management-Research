<title>
PRIORITIZATION OF DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS FOR INCIDENT DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
A method, computer program product, and computer system for prioritization of data collection and analysis for incident detection. Data points within a plurality of monitor data corresponding to effects of incidents may be identified by a computing device. The plurality of monitor data may be converted to a set of time series extracted from the plurality of monitor data. The set of time series may be aligned and summarized. A causal relationship graph may be constructed between the set of time series extracted from the plurality of monitor data. Features may be prioritized by likelihood of importance in incident analysis based upon, at least in part, the causal relationship graph.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: identifying, by a computing device, data points within a plurality of monitor data corresponding to effects of incidents; converting the plurality of monitor data to a set of time series extracted from the plurality of monitor data; aligning and summarizing the set of time series; constructing a causal relationship graph between the set of time series extracted from the plurality of monitor data; and prioritizing features by likelihood of importance in incident analysis based upon, at least in part, the causal relationship graph.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 further comprising windowing the set of time series to examine only the monitor data within a time range with causal analysis.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 further comprising reducing a number of features to be analyzed by causal analysis.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 wherein prioritizing features includes generating a prioritization score.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1 wherein constructing the causal relationship graph includes pruning the causal relationship graph to remove one or more edges.
