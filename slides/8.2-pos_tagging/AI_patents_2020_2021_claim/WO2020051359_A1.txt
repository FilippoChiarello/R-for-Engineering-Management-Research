SHOPPING BASKET MONITORING USING COMPUTER VISION AND MACHINE LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
A system for monitoring shopping baskets (e.g., baskets on human-propelled carts, motorized carts, or hand-carried baskets) can include a computer vision unit that can image a surveillance region (e.g., an exit to a store), determine whether a basket is empty or loaded with merchandise, and assess a potential for theft of the merchandise. The computer vision unit can include a camera and an image processor programmed to execute a computer vision algorithm to identify shopping baskets and determine a load status of the basket. The computer vision algorithm can comprise a neural network. The system can identify an at least partially loaded shopping basket that is exiting the store, without indicia of having paid for the merchandise, and execute an anti-theft action, e.g., actuating an alarm, notifying store personnel, activating a store surveillance system, activating an anti-theft device associated with the basket (e.g., a locking shopping cart wheel), etc.

<claims>
1. An anti-theft system comprising:
a computer vision unit (CVU) configured to image a region of a facility, the CVU comprising:
a camera;
a radio frequency (RF) communication node; and an image processor; and
a human-propelled, wheeled cart comprising:
a basket configured to hold merchandise;
a wheel comprising a brake configured to inhibit movement of the cart when the brake is actuated; and
an RF cart transceiver configured to communicate with the RF communication node of the CVU and the brake,
wherein the image processor is programmed to analyze images of the region of the facility obtained by the camera to:
determine that the basket of the cart is at least partially loaded with merchandise; and
determine that the cart is attempting to exit the region of the facility, wherein the RF communication node is configured to:
communicate a command to the RF cart transceiver to actuate the brake of the wheel.
2. The anti-theft system of claim 1, wherein the CVU is further configured to:
communicate with a payment point of the facility;
receive an indication from the payment point that a payment has not been made for the merchandise in the basket of the cart,
wherein the indication is received prior to communication of the command to the RF cart transceiver to actuate the brake of the wheel.
3. The anti-theft system of claim 1, wherein the image processor is programmed to apply a neural network to the images obtained by the camera.
4. The anti-theft system of claim 1, wherein the image processor is further programmed to determine a path of the cart in the region of the facility.
5. The anti-theft system of claim 1, wherein the CVU is further programmed to store the images of the region in a remote, non-transitory computer storage medium.
6. The anti-theft system of claim 1, wherein the camera, the RF communication node, and the image processor are disposed in a housing configured to be mounted to a structure in the facility.
7. The anti-theft system of claim 1, wherein the camera and the RF communication node are disposed in a housing configured to be mounted to a structure in the facility and the image processor is disposed remotely from the housing.
8. The anti-theft system of claim 1, wherein the facility comprises a retail store and the human-propelled cart comprises a shopping cart.
9. The anti-theft system of claim 8, wherein the region comprises a store entrance, a store exit, a checkout lane, a payment point, or a region where high-value merchandise is stored.
10. A method of reducing theft of merchandise from a retail store, the method comprising:
under control of an anti-theft system comprising computer hardware:
obtaining images of a region of the retail store;
identifying, from the images, presence of a shopping basket in the region; determining, from the images, a load status indicative of whether the shopping basket is at least partially loaded with merchandise;
receiving payment information indicative of whether the merchandise in the shopping basket has been paid for; and
communicating, based at least partly on the load status and the payment information, an anti-theft command.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the identifying or the determining are performed using a neural network.
12. The method of claim 10, further comprising determining, from the images, a path of the shopping basket in the region.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein receiving payment information comprises: obtaining second images of a payment point; determining, from the second images, whether the shopping basket passed the payment point, spent more than a threshold time near the payment point, interacted with a store attendant, or accessed a payment system at the payment point.
14. The method of claim 10, further comprising determining a unicast address associated with a radio frequency (RF) receiver associated with the shopping basket.
15. The method of claim 10, wherein communicating the anti-theft command comprises communicating to a transceiver associated with the shopping basket, to a checkout barrier, to a brake associated with a wheel associated with the shopping basket, or to a video surveillance system of the retail store.
16. The method of claim 10, wherein the anti-theft command comprises a command to lock or brake a wheel associated with the shopping basket, a command to actuate an alarm or a warning, or a command to store personnel that a theft situation is occurring.
17. The method of claim 10, wherein the shopping basket is associated with a wheeled, human-propelled shopping cart.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the shopping cart comprises a wheel having a brake, and the anti-theft command comprises a command to actuate the brake.
19. The method of claim 10, wherein the shopping basket is associated with a handheld shopping basket.
20. The method of claim 10, further comprising:
classifying the images of the region of the retail store to annotate shopping baskets or the load status of the shopping baskets so as to provide a set of training images; and
training a machine learning algorithm using the set of training images.
