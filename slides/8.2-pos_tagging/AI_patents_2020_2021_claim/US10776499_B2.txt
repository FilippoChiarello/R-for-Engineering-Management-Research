<title>
Remotely controlling access to online content
</title>

<abstract>
Various embodiments provide an approach to controlled access to online content. Such control may be based on a multitude of factors including but not limited to website content, profile for the person consuming the data. In operation, machine-learning techniques are used to classify the websites based on community and social media inputs, crowd-sourced data, as well as access rules implemented by parents or system administrators. Feedback from users/admins of the system, including the instances of allowed or denied access to websites, in conjunction with other relevant parameters, is used for iterative machine-learning techniques. Embodiments may also allow for real, or near real-time, approval or denial of access to websites by registered admins.

<claims>
1. A method for remotely controlling access to a website, comprising the steps of: registering an admin device with a server connected to a router; receiving a request to access a website from a client browser connected to the router; retrieving, to the router, a client profile stored on one of the router and the server; accessing, in the router, a crowd sourced safety rank stored on one of the router and the server; analyzing, in the router, the crowd sourced safety rank for the website and the client profile to determine that access to the website is not permitted; receiving, in the router, an authorization request from the client browser; forwarding the authorization request from the router to the admin device; receiving, in the router, a response from the admin device; determining, in the router, one of allowing and denying said authorization request responsive to the receipt of the response; returning, from the router responsive to said determining, one of the website and an access denied message to the client browser.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of receiving a response comprises receiving the response from an application running on the admin device.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of receiving a response comprises receiving the response from the admin device via the server.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of forwarding the authorization request is performed via an internet connection.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of forwarding the authorization request is performed via simple message service.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the response comprises configuration data.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of routing the response to the router through the server.
8. A method for remotely controlling access to a website, comprising the steps of: registering an admin device with a server connected to a router; sending to the router a crowd sourced safety rank for a web site responsive to a query from a browser; receiving, from the router, a determination that access to the website is not permitted; receiving a request from the router to access a web interface page; serving the web interface page to the router; receiving an authorization request via the web interface page from the router; sending the authorization request to the admin device; receiving a response from the admin device at the server; transmitting the response to the router; receiving from the router one of an instruction allowing and an instruction denying said request; serving to the router one of the web site and an access denied message for the client browser responsive to the instruction from the router.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the step of receiving a response comprises receiving the response from an application running on the admin device.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the step of receiving a response comprises receiving the response from the admin device via the router.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein the step of sending the authorization request is performed via an internet connection.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the step of sending the authorization request is performed via simple message service.
13. The method of claim 8, wherein the response comprises configuration data.
