Filling device
</title>

<abstract>
A method for preventing a malfunction of a filling device when a container is filled by a user with a beverage. The method includes providing a filling device comprising a control unit which controls the filling device, a camera which takes an image of a container currently being used with the filling device and which outputs the image to a classifier which then uses a trained learning algorithm to analyze the output of the image of the container provided by the camera. The trained learning algorithm of the classifier analyzes which container is currently being used based on characteristics of the container so as to classify the container into a predefined class. The predefined class is then employed by the control unit to prevent the malfunction of the filling device.

<claims>
1. A method for preventing a malfunction of a filling device when a container is filled by a user with a beverage, the method comprising: providing a filling device comprising, a control unit which is configured to control the filling device by at least one of limiting a selection of the beverage, preventing an incorrect selection of the beverage, stopping a dispensing of the beverage, and providing a warning to the user, a camera which is configured to take an image of a container which is currently being used with the filling device and to output the image thereof to a classifier, the classifier which uses a trained learning algorithm which is trained to analyze the output of the image provided by the camera of the container currently being used with the filling device; taking, via the camera, the image of the container which is currently being used with the filling device; outputting, from the camera, the image of the container which is currently being used with the filling device to the classifier; analyzing, via the trained learning algorithm of the classifier, which container is currently being used with the filling device based on characteristics of the container currently being used with the filling device so as to classify the container into a predefined class; and employing the predefined class by the control unit to prevent the malfunction of the filling device.
2. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the malfunction is a filling of the container with an improper content of the beverage or an improper quantity of the beverage.
3. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the trained learning algorithm of the classifier further classifies the container into a type of the container currently being used with the filling device.
4. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the trained learning algorithm of the classifier is further trained to provide a probability vector whose individual values represent a probability that the container currently being used with the filling device is assignable to a previously defined category.
5. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the trained learning algorithm of the classifier is a regression algorithm which provides an estimation of a maximum possible filling volume of the container currently being used with the filling device.
6. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the trained learning algorithm of the classifier is an artificial neural network trained by a backpropagation method.
7. The method as recited in claim 6, wherein the artificial neural network is a pre-trained convolutional neural network.
8. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the trained learning algorithm of the classifier is further trained to detect an overflow of the container, and if the overflow is detected, the method further comprises: transmitting a signal to the control unit so that the control unit can control the filling device by at least one stopping the dispensing of the beverage and providing the warning to the user.
9. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the trained learning algorithm of the classifier is further trained to recognize and categorize predefined human hand gestures, and the method further comprises: transmitting the predefined human hand gestures recognized and categorized by the trained learning algorithm to the control unit so that the control unit can influence a mode of operation of the filling device based thereon.
10. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein, the filling device is a coffee machine, and the container to be filled includes a glass, a cup, a coffee cup, a cappuccino cup, a latte macchiato glass, and a jug.
11. A filling device for filling a container as recited in claim 1.
12. A method for preventing a malfunction of a filling device when a container is filled by a user with a beverage, the method comprising: providing a filling device comprising, a control unit which is configured to control the filling device by at least one of limiting a selection of the beverage, preventing an incorrect selection of the beverage, stopping a dispensing of the beverage, and providing a warning to the user, a camera which is configured to take an image of a container which is currently being used with the filling device and to output the image thereof to a classifier, and the classifier which uses a trained learning algorithm which is trained to analyze the output of the image provided by the camera of the container currently being used with the filling device; taking, via the camera, the image of the container which is currently being used with the filling device; outputting, from the camera, the image of the container which is currently being used with the filling device to the classifier; analyzing, via the trained learning algorithm of the classifier, which container is currently being used with the filling device based on characteristics of the container currently being used with the filling device so as to classify the container into a predefined class; and employing the predefined class by the control unit to prevent the malfunction of the filling device, wherein, the malfunction is a filling of the container with an improper content of the beverage or an improper quantity of the beverage.
