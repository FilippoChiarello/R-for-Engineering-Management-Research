<abstract>
One variation of a method for characterizing inputs includes: scanning an array of sense electrodes at a first resolution to generate a first force image; detecting a first force input in the first force image; in response to a first geometry dimension of the first force input exceeding a first threshold, characterizing the first force input as a non-stylus input type; in response to the first geometry dimension of the first force input remaining below the first threshold: scanning the array of sense electrodes at a second resolution; detecting a second force input in a second force image; and, in response to a ratio of a force magnitude of the second force input to a geometry dimension of the second force input exceeding a second threshold, characterizing the first force input as a stylus input type; and outputting a location and a type of the first force input.
