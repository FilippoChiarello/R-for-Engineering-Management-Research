NETWORK SECURITY PROTECTION METHOD AND DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A network security protection method and apparatus are provided. The method is executed by a network security protection device, and includes: obtaining at least one of network environment data or threat detection data of a host that is in a protected network and that is connected to the network security protection device, where the network environment data includes at least one of the following: an identifier of an operating system, a parameter of the operating system, an identifier of software with a network port access function, or a parameter of the software; and the threat detection data includes at least one of the following: a threat type or a threat identifier, where the threat type includes at least one of a vulnerability or a malicious program; searching, according to the obtained at least one of network environment data or threat detection data, for corresponding information used to eliminate a security threat in the host; and sending the information used to eliminate the security threat in the host to the host. In this way, a problem of poor efficiency of an existing network security protection technology is resolved.

<claims>
1. A network security protection method, executed by a network security protection device, comprising: obtaining (310) network environment data or threat detection data of a host that is in a protected network and that is connected to the network security protection device, wherein the network environment data comprises at least one of the following: an identifier of an operating system, a parameter of the operating system, an identifier of software with a network port access function, or a parameter of the software; and the threat detection data comprises at least one of the following: a threat type or a threat identifier, wherein the threat type comprises a vulnerability; searching (320), according to the obtained network environment data or threat detection data, for corresponding information used to eliminate a security threat in the host, wherein the information used to eliminate the security threat in the host comprises:
a file operation instruction, wherein the file operation instruction comprises a file identifier, a file storage location, and an operator, and the file operation instruction is used to instruct the host to perform an operation represented by the operator on a file that is in the host and that is determined according to the file identifier and the file storage location; and sending (330) the information used to eliminate the security threat in the host to the host.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the operator is Del, and the file operation instruction is used to instruct the host to delete a file that is in the host and that is determined according to the file identifier and the file storage location.
3. A network security protection apparatus, comprising: a receiving unit (801), configured to obtain network environment data or threat detection data of a host that is in a protected network and that is connected to the network security protection apparatus, wherein the network environment data comprises at least one of the following: an identifier of an operating system, a parameter of the operating system, an identifier of software with a network port access function, or a parameter of the software; and the threat detection data comprises at least one of the following: a threat type or a threat identifier, wherein the threat type comprises a vulnerability; a processing unit (802), configured to search, according to the network environment data or threat detection data obtained by the receiving unit (801), for corresponding information used to eliminate a security threat in the host, wherein the information used to eliminate the security threat in the host comprises:
a file operation instruction, wherein the file operation instruction comprises a file identifier, a file storage location, and an operator, and the file operation instruction is used to instruct the host to perform an operation represented by the operator on a file that is in the host and that is determined according to the file identifier and the file storage location; and a sending unit (803), configured to provide the host with the information that is used to eliminate the security threat in the host and that is found by the processing unit (802).
4. The apparatus according to claim 3, wherein operator is Del, and the file operation instruction is used to instruct the host to delete a file that is in the host and that is determined according to the file identifier and the file storage location.
5. A network security protection device, comprising: a processor (202), a memory (201), and a network interface (203), wherein the processor (202), the memory (201), and the network interface (203) communicate with each other by using a bus (204); the memory (201) is configured to store program code and data; the network interface (203) is configured to obtain network environment data or threat detection data of a host that is in a protected network and that is connected to the network security protection device, wherein the network environment data comprises at least one of the following: an identifier of an operating system, a parameter of the operating system, an identifier of software with a network port access function, or a parameter of the software; and the threat detection data comprises at least one of the following: a threat type or a threat identifier, wherein the threat type comprises a vulnerability; the processor (202) is configured to read the program code and the data that are stored in the memory (201), to perform the following operations: searching, according to network environment data or threat detection data obtained by using the network interface, for corresponding information used to eliminate a security threat in the host, wherein the information used to eliminate the security threat in the host comprises:
a file operation instruction, wherein the file operation instruction comprises a file identifier, a file storage location, and an operator, and the file operation instruction is used to instruct the host to perform an operation represented by the operator on a file that is in the host and that is determined according to the file identifier and the file storage location; and providing, by using the network interface (203), the host with the information used to eliminate the security threat in the host.
6. The device according to claim 5, wherein the operator is Del, and the file operation instruction is used to instruct the host to delete a file that is in the host and that is determined according to the file identifier and the file storage location.
