<title>
Systems and methods to de-duplicate features for machine learning model
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods, and non-transitory computer readable media are configured to determine a feature set for a model to be trained by machine learning. A subset of features from the feature set can be associated with entities having relationship types and corresponding to pages on a social networking system. The feature set can be reduced based on at least one rule applied to the relationship types.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: determining, by a computing system, a feature set for a model to be trained by machine learning, wherein the model is trained to identify users suitable for employment with an organization and features from the feature set include entities represented as pages on a social networking system, the entities having relationship types including a relationship involving a first entity and a second entity; determining, by the computing system, counts of interactions by a plurality of users of the social networking system with the pages; and reducing, by the computing system, a number of the entities represented as pages on the social networking system in the feature set for the model trained to identify users suitable for employment based on at least one rule relating to counts of interactions with a page of the social networking system associated with the first entity and counts of interactions with a page of the social networking system associated with the second entity, wherein the first entity and the second entity are related as child entity and parent entity.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the at least one rule provides that the child entity is selected as a feature for the child entity when the condition is satisfied and wherein the condition requires that the selected child entity have a count of interactions that is a predetermined factor higher than a count of interactions of the parent entity.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the relationship types include a relationship involving a child entity having a set of parent entities.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 3, wherein the at least one rule provides that a parent entity from the set of parent entities is selected as a feature for the child entity when the condition is satisfied and wherein the condition requires that the selected parent entity have a highest count of page interactions among all parent entities in the set of parent entities.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the relationship types include a relationship involving a set of entities in a cyclic relationship.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 5, wherein the at least one rule provides that an entity from the set of entities is selected as a feature for all of the entities in the set of entities when the condition is satisfied and wherein the condition requires that the selected entity have a highest count of page interactions among all entities in the set of entities.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the relationship types are initially determined by at least one of automated analysis or manual curation of information sources.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein during an evaluation stage users and their associated features are provided to the model to generate a respective score for each user associated with a probability that the user is qualified for a job with an organization.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein a score of a current or previous employee of the organization is reduced in value.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein scores for the users are ordered and reflected in a laser table.
11. A system comprising: at least one processor; and a memory storing instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the system to perform: determining a feature set for a model to be trained by machine learning, wherein the model is trained to identify users suitable for employment with an organization and features from the feature set include entities represented as pages on a social networking system, the entities having relationship types including a relationship involving a first entity and a second entity; determining counts of interactions by a plurality of users of the social networking system with the pages; and reducing a number of the entities represented as pages on the social networking system in the feature set for the model trained to identify users suitable for employment based on at least one rule relating to on counts of interactions with a page of the social networking system associated with the first entity and counts of interactions with a page of the social networking system associated with the second entity, wherein the first entity and the second entity are related as child entity and parent entity.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the at least one rule provides that the child entity is selected as a feature for the child entity when the condition is satisfied and wherein the condition requires that the selected child entity have a count of interactions that is a predetermined factor higher than a count of interactions of the parent entity.
13. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium including instructions that, when executed by at least one processor of a computing system, cause the computing system to perform a method comprising: determining a feature set for a model to be trained by machine learning, wherein the model is trained to identify users suitable for employment with an organization and features from the feature set with entities having relationship types including a relationship involving a first entity and a second entity; determining counts of interactions by a plurality of users of the social networking system with the pages; and reducing a number of the entities represented as pages on the social networking system in the feature set for the model trained to identify users suitable for employment based on at least one rule relating to counts of interactions with a page of the social networking system associated with the first entity and counts of interactions with a page of the social networking system associated with the second entity, wherein the first entity and the second entity are related as child entity and parent entity.
14. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 13, wherein the at least one rule provides that the child entity is selected as a feature for the child entity when the condition is satisfied and wherein the condition requires that the selected child entity have a count of interactions that is a predetermined factor higher than a count of interactions of the parent entity.
