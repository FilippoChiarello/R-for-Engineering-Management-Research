LAMINATED CORE, ROTARY ELECTRIC MACHINE, AND METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING LAMINATED CORE
</title>

<abstract>
A laminated core has a plurality of steel plates that are laminated in a thickness direction. The laminated core has a line shaped welding mark connecting a plurality of steel plates. The welding mark extends over the plurality of steel plates at the end face where the plurality of steel plates are exposed. The welding mark has a welding depth which fluctuates with a wavelength that is longer than the thickness of the steel sheet. The welding mark has a continuous portion in which the welding depth extends over a plurality of steel plates without fluctuation. Furthermore, the welding mark has a fluctuation portion in which the welding depth periodically fluctuates over a plurality of steel plates. The depth in the continuous portion is substantially equal to the depth in the fluctuation portion.

<claims>
1. A laminated core comprising: a plurality of steel plates laminated in a thickness direction; and a line shaped welding mark connecting a plurality of the steel plates, extending over the plurality of the steel plates at an end surface where the plurality of the steel plates are exposed, and having a welding depth which fluctuates at a wavelength longer than the thickness of the steel plates.
2. The laminated core claimed in claim 1, wherein the welding mark has a fluctuating width at the end face, and the fluctuating width has a one-sided fluctuation width smaller than the thickness of the steel plate.
3. The laminated core claimed in claim 1, wherein the welding mark extends inclined with respect to the thickness direction.
4. The laminated core claimed in claim 1, wherein the welding mark is one of a plurality of welding marks.
5. The laminated core claimed in claim 4, wherein the plurality of welding marks are arranged at equal intervals.
6. The laminated core claimed in claim 1, wherein the laminated core is one of a plurality of laminated arranged in a laminated manner.
7. The laminated core claimed in claim 1, wherein the welding mark has a width larger than a thickness of the steel plate at the end surface, and wherein the welding mark has a continuous portion extending without fluctuation over the plurality of steel plates, and a fluctuating portion fluctuating periodically over the plurality of the steel plates, with respect to the depth direction, and wherein a depth in the continuous portion and a depth in the fluctuating portion are substantially equal.
8. A rotary electric machine comprising: a rotor core or a stator core, which is the laminated core claimed in claim 1, wherein the welding depth of the welding mark fluctuates along the axial direction of the rotor core or the stator core.
9. A method for manufacturing a laminated core, the method comprising: a laminating step of laminating a plurality of steel plates in a thickness direction; a pulse generating step of generating a plurality of pulses of welding energy by a welding device; a welding step in which the welding energy is applied to a welding position of an end surface where the plurality of steel plates are exposed, and thereby forming a welding mark having a welding depth according to the welding energy; and a moving step of moving the welding position across the plurality of steel plates on the end surface, wherein the welding step and the moving step form a line shaped welding mark having the welding depth fluctuating at a wavelength longer than the thickness of the steel plate by a plurality of the pulses on the end surface.
10. The method for manufacturing a laminated core claimed in claim 9, wherein the welding step and the moving step forms: a continuous portion extending without fluctuation of the welding depth over the plurality of steel plates with respect to the depth direction by a plurality of the pulses; and a fluctuating portion, in which the welding depth fluctuates periodically over the plurality of the steel plates, having a depth substantially equal to a depth in the continuous portion.
