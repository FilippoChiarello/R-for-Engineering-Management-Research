<title>
Data processing method and data processing system
</title>

<abstract>
In a data processing method executed by a computer: inputting, in a third trained model, first output data corresponding to first input data for a first trained model to obtain second output data, the third trained model being acquired through training in which (i) output data of the first trained model is used as training data, and (ii) output data of a second trained model acquired by converting the first trained model is used as label data; obtaining first label data of the first input data; and retraining the first trained model using first differential data corresponding to differences between the second output data and the first label data.
