<title>
System for managing services in software defined infrastructures
</title>

<abstract>
A system includes a provider module to serve a Software Defined Infrastructure (SDI) service request in a first language. The system includes an NSP translation module to translate the SDI requests from the first language into a service chain including a set of Network and Service Primitives (NSP), and a service space module to map each NSP onto a multidimensional vector space using a matrix. The matrix provides positions within the multidimensional vector space of vectors corresponding to any possible NSP. The service space module queries the matrix with a sequence of vectors to retrieve a further sequence of vectors by geometric operations to find a level of similarity between the vectors and the vectors of the service space, in order to predict a new NSP according to the further sequence starting from neighbor NSPs, and predict the neighbors NSPs composing the further sequence.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: a provider module configured to serve a Software Defined Infrastructure (SDI) service request generated by a consumer, such SDI service request being formulated in a first language; an NSP translation module configured to translate such SDI requests from said first language into a corresponding service chain comprising a set of Network and Service Primitives (NSP) comprising at least one NSP; a service space module configured to map each NSP of a service chain onto a multidimensional vector space by exploiting a space matrix, said space matrix being a data structure providing the positions within the multidimensional vector space of vectors NSP(i) corresponding to any possible NSP; and wherein said service space module is also configured to query said space matrix with a sequence SNSP of vectors NSP(i) so as to retrieve a further sequence SNSP′ of vectors NSP′(i) by carrying out on the vectors NSP(i) of the sequence SNSP geometric operations in order to find a level of similarity between such vectors and the vectors of the V-dimensional service space SS so as to carry out at least one among: predict a new NSP in the composition of the further sequence SNSP′ starting from a set of neighbors NSPs composing the sequence SNSP; and predict a set of neighbors NSPs composing the further sequence SNSP′, starting from a NSP of the sequence SNSP.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the NSPs of the set of NSP corresponding to a generic SDI request are selected from a vocabulary set of NSPs comprising a first number of NSPs.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein each vector corresponding to a NSP is a vector having a number of elements equal to said first number, each element of the vector corresponding to a NSP of the vocabulary set of NSPs.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein each vector corresponding to a specific NSP has the element corresponding to said specific NSP sets to a first value, while the other elements of said vector are set to values different from the first value.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein each element of said other elements of said vector is set to a value indicative of a correlation degree between the specific NSP corresponding to said vector and the NSP of the vocabulary set of NSPs corresponding to such element.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein said geometric operations comprise at least one among: sum, and difference among said vectors.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein said first language is an intent based language.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the service space module is configured to carry out and update said mapping of each NSP of the service chain onto the multidimensional vector space by means of artificial intelligence learning methods exploiting recurrent neutral networks.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the SDI provider module comprises a control module and a physical SDI infrastructure module, said control module being configured to manage real and virtual resources and functions of the physical SDI infrastructure module so as to accomplish the SDI service request SR according to the further sequences SNSP′ generated by the service space module.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein said physical SDI infrastructure module comprises at least one among: networks, network nodes, IT systems, data centers, and processing and storage units.
