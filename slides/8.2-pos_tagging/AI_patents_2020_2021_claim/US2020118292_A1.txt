<title>
Broad area geospatial object detection using autogenerated deep learning models
</title>

<abstract>
A system for automated geospatial image analysis comprising a deep learning model that receives orthorectified geospatial images, pre-labeled to demarcate objects of interest. The module presents marked geospatial images and a second set of unmarked, optimized, training geospatial images to a convolutional neural network. This process may be repeated so that an image analysis software module can detect multiple object types or categories. The image analysis software module receives orthorectified geospatial images from one or more geospatial image caches. Using a multi-scale sliding window submodule, image analysis software scans geospatial images, detects objects present and geospatially locates them.

<claims>
1. A system for broad area geospatial object detection using auto-generated deep learning models, comprising: a deep learning model training software module stored in a memory of and operating on a processor of a computing device; and an image analysis software module stored in the memory of and operating on the processor of the computing device; wherein the deep learning model training software module: receives training data comprising a plurality of orthorectified geospatial images with a plurality of labeled objects present therein; classifies the training data into a plurality of categories; applies one or more image modification steps to the training data; and generates an object classification model from the training data using a deep learning method comprising processing of the training data through a convolutional neural network system; and wherein the image analysis software module: receives orthorectified geospatial imagery; applies a plurality of image modifications to the orthorectified geospatial imagery; discards images unsuitable for analysis; uses the object classification model to automatically identify and label all objects of interest in the received orthorectified geospatial imagery; and outputs the geospatial locations of the identified objects of interest.
2. A method for conducting automated identification of feature items from orthorectified geospatial imagery data comprising the following steps: receiving, at a deep learning model training software module stored in a memory of and operating on a processor of a computing device, training data comprising a plurality of orthorectified geospatial images with a plurality of labeled objects present therein; classifying the training data into a plurality of categories using the deep learning model training software module; applying one or more image modification steps to the training data using the deep learning model training software module; generating an object classification model from the training data using a deep learning method comprising processing of the training data through a convolutional neural network system operating as part of the deep learning model training software module; receiving orthorectified geospatial imagery at an image analysis software module stored in the memory of and operating on the processor of the computing device; applying a plurality of image modifications to the orthorectified geospatial imagery using the image analysis software module; discarding images unsuitable for analysis using the image analysis software module; using the object classification model to automatically identify and label all objects of interest in the received orthorectified geospatial imagery using the image analysis software module; and outputting the geospatial locations of the identified objects of interest using the image analysis software module.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of categories are pre-defined.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of image modification steps are drawn from a set comprising artifact removal, color standardization, and resolution data determination.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the objects of interest are automatically identified and labeled regardless of the orientation of that feature item within the section.
6. The system of claim 5, further wherein the objects of interest are automatically identified and labeled accounting for differences in item scale by using a multi-scale sliding window algorithm.
7. The method of claim 2, wherein the plurality of categories are pre-defined.
8. The method of claim 2, wherein the plurality of image modification steps are drawn from a set comprising artifact removal, color standardization, and resolution data determination.
9. The method of claim 2, wherein the feature items of interest are identified regardless of the orientation of that feature item within the section.
10. The method of claim 9, further wherein the feature items of interest are identified accounting for differences in item scale by using a multi-scale sliding window algorithm.
