METHOD AND APPARATUS WITH BLUR ESTIMATION
</title>

<abstract>
A processor-implemented method with blur estimation includes: acquiring size information of an input image; resizing the input image to generate a target image of a preset size; estimating a blur of the target image; and estimating a blur of the input image based on the size information of the input image.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A processor-implemented method with blur estimation, comprising: acquiring size information of an input image; resizing the input image to generate a target image of a preset size; estimating a blur of the target image; and estimating a blur of the input image based on the size information of the input image.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the acquiring of the size information of the input image comprises acquiring size information of a region of interest (ROI) in the input image.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the estimating of the blur of the input image comprises correcting the blur of the input image based on a ratio between the size information of the input image and size information of the target image.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein each of the size information of the input image and the size information of the target image comprises an area, a height, and a width.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: performing a liveness test on the input image based on a result of a comparison between the estimated blur of the input image and a threshold.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the threshold adaptively varies based on the size information of the input image.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein the liveness test fails in receiving a verification, in response to the estimated blur of the input image being greater than or equal to the threshold, or wherein the liveness test succeeds in receiving the verification, in response to the estimated blur of the input image being less than the threshold.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the estimating of the blur of the input image comprises correcting the blur of the input image by combining the size information of the input image and the estimated blur of the target image.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the estimating of the blur of the input image comprises estimating the blur of the input image using a blur estimation model based on a neural network.
10. A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform the method of claim 1.
11. An apparatus with blur estimation, comprising: a memory storing computer-readable instructions; and one or more processors, wherein, in response to the instructions being executed by the one or more processors, the one or more processors are configured to: acquire size information of an input image; resize the input image to generate a target image of a preset size; estimate a blur of the target image; and estimate a blur of the input image based on the size information of the input image.
12. The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to acquire the size information of the input image by acquiring size information of a region of interest (ROI) in the input image.
13. The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the processor is further configured to estimate the blur of the input image by correcting the blur of the input image based on a ratio between the size information of the input image and size information of the target image.
14. The apparatus of claim 13, wherein each of the size information of the input image and the size information of the target image comprises an area, a height, and a width.
15. The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to perform a liveness test on the input image based on a result of a comparison between the estimated blur of the input image and a threshold.
16. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the threshold adaptively varies based on the size information of the input image.
17. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the liveness test fails in receiving a verification, in response to the estimated blur of the input image being greater than or equal to the threshold, or wherein the liveness test succeeds in receiving the verification, in response to the estimated blur of the input image being less than the threshold.
18. The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to correct the blur of the input image by combining the size information of the input image and the estimated blur of the target image.
19. The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to estimate the blur of the input image using a blur estimation model based on a neural network.
20. An apparatus with user verification, comprising: a camera configured to capture an input image; and one or more processors configured to: resize the input image to generate a target image of a preset size different from a size of the input image; estimate a blur of the target image; estimate a blur of the input image based on the size of the input image, the preset size, and the estimated blur of the target image; perform a liveness test on the input image based on the estimated blur of the input image; and perform the user verification based on a result of the liveness test.
21. The apparatus of claim 20, wherein the preset size is smaller than the size of the input image, and each of the preset size and the size of the input image is a resolution.
22. The apparatus of claim 20, wherein the estimating of the blur of the input image based on the size of the input image, the preset size, and the estimated blur of the target image comprises: estimating the blur of the input image by determining a ratio between the size of the input image and the size of the target image; and applying the determined ratio to the estimated blur of the target image.
23. The apparatus of claim 20, wherein the performing of the liveness test on the input image based on the estimated blur of the input image comprises comparing the estimated blur of the input image to a threshold.
24. The apparatus of claim 23, wherein the performing of the user verification based on the result of the liveness test comprises: failing to verify a user inputting the input image, in response to the estimated blur of the input image being greater than or equal to the threshold; or verifying the user inputting the input image, in response to the estimated blur of the input image being less than the threshold.
