<title>
Automated communication design construction system
</title>

<abstract>
A method for automatically analyzing and constructing communications to a plurality of recipients includes automatically separating communication content files into page groups in a system comprising one or more intelligent communication design servers, wherein each of the page groups is associated a recipient of the communications, inputting the communication content files into an intra-page machine prediction model to produce intra-page parameters, inputting the communication content files and the intra-page parameters into an intra-page machine prediction model to produce intra-group parameters and inter-group parameters, automatically constructing standard communication design files by an intelligent communication content learning and constructing engine based on the communication content files and the intra-page parameters, intra-group parameters, and inter-group parameters, and printing and finishing physical mailing pieces to be mailed to the recipients based on the standard communication design files.

<claims>
1. A system for automatically analyzing and constructing communications to a plurality of recipients, comprising: one or more servers configured to automatically separate communication content files into page groups, wherein each of the page groups is associated a recipient of the communications, wherein the one or more servers are configured to input the communication content files into an intra-page machine prediction model to produce intra-page parameters, wherein the one or more servers are configured to input the communication content files, which are categorized into page groups based on recipients of the communications, and the intra-page parameters into an inter-page machine prediction model to produce intra-group parameters and inter-group parameters, wherein each of intra-group parameters is associated with an individual recipient and the inter-group parameters are associated with different recipients, wherein the one or more servers are configured to automatically construct standard communication design files based on the communication content files and the intra-page parameters, intra-group parameters, and inter-group parameters; and one or more product fulfillment centers configured to print and finish physical mailing pieces to be mailed to the recipients based on the standard communication design files.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more servers are configured to automatically convert communication content files in different formats to normalized intermediate format files before the communication content files are separated into page groups, wherein the communication content files define content of communications to the plurality of recipients.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the standard communication design files are sent from the one or more servers to one or more product fulfillment centers.
4. The system of claim 2, wherein the intra-page parameters, the intra-group parameters, and inter-group parameters are stored in a unified file structure for the normalized intermediate format files.
5. The system of claim 2, wherein a common wireframe in the normalized intermediate format files is automatically identified between different recipients based on locations of the zones and content in the zones.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the intra-page parameters include zones, image objects, text objects, and paragraphs within individual pages.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the intra-group parameters include static global objects that are invariant between recipients.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the static global objects include text, logos, and images that are common to different recipients.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein the static global objects include wireframes, page behaviors, and layout formatting that are common to different recipients.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the inter-group parameters include variable global objects.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the variable global objects include text, logos, and images that vary between recipients.
12. The system of claim 10, wherein the variable global objects include wireframes, page behaviors, and paragraph styles that vary between recipients.
13. The system of claim 1, wherein the inter-group parameters include data variables that vary between recipients.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the data variables include a recipient's personally identifiable information comprising unique ID, name, address, or dates.
15. The system of claim 1, wherein the intra-page machine prediction model is trained using historic communication files and associated intra-page parameters.
16. The system of claim 1, wherein the inter-page machine prediction model is trained using historic communication files and associated intra-group parameters and inter-group parameters.
17. The system of claim 1, wherein the different formats of the communication content files include fixed length, delimited, XML, Microsoft Excel, INDD, PDF, WORD, FONT, or JPEG.
18. The system of claim 1, wherein the standard communication design files are automatically classified based on communication channel types, wherein the communication channel types include physical prints, e-mails, or web form.
