<title>
Method and device for modifying imaging properties of an optical system for microlithography
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosure provides a method and an apparatus for modifying imaging properties of a microlithographic optical system. In a method according to the disclosure, the imaging properties are modified by way of control signals coupled into the optical system by way of at least one interface. The values of the control signals that are in each case coupled in during the controlling for a desired modification of the imaging properties are ascertained on the basis of a model. The model is created by virtue of performing, in a learning phase in which the modification of the imaging properties that is in each case attained for different values of the control signals is ascertained, a successive individual adaptation of the model to the optical system. The learning phase is performed without prior specification of explicit information relating to internal mechanisms of action within the optical system.
