VIDEO PROCESSING
</title>

<abstract>
A video processing method comprises detecting, as a reference pose, a pose of an individual at a reference time point in an input video sequence; at a second, different, time point in the input video sequence, detecting a second pose of the individual; generating from one or more source images of the individual, a transitional video sequence representing a transition of the individual from the second pose to the reference pose; and associating the transitional video sequence with the input video sequence to generate an output video sequence including at least the transitional video sequence to implement a non-linear replay branch from the second time point to the reference time point.

<claims>
1. A video processing method comprising: detecting, as a reference pose, a pose of an individual at a reference time point in an input video sequence; at a second, different, time point in the input video sequence, detecting a second pose of the individual; generating from one or more source images of the individual, a transitional video sequence representing a transition of the individual from the second pose to the reference pose; and associating the transitional video sequence with the input video sequence to generate an output video sequence including at least the transitional video sequence to implement a non-linear replay branch from the second time point to the reference time point.
2. A method according to claim 1, in which: the step of detecting the reference pose comprises detecting a reference skeletal pose of the individual at the reference time point; and the step of detecting the second pose comprises detecting a second skeletal pose of the individual at the second time point.
3. A method according to claim 2, in which the generating step comprises: generating a sequence of skeletal representations which transition from the reference skeletal pose to the second skeletal pose; and generating respective video images of the individual for each of the sequence of skeletal representations in dependence upon the one or more source images.
4. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, in which the second time point is later in time, with respect to the input video signal, than the reference time point.
5. A method according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the associating step comprises associating the transitional video sequence with the second time point.
6. A method according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the associating step comprises associating the transitional video sequence with the reference time point.
7. A method according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the step of generating the transitional video sequence comprises selecting a number of frames for the transitional video sequence in response the magnitude of difference between the second pose and the reference pose so as to provide sufficient intermediate poses that each limb or segment of the individual does not exceed a threshold maximum pose change between successive frames.
8. A method of generating a video programme product, the method comprising: generating one or more output video sequences according to any one of the preceding claims; generating control signals defining transitions between the output video sequences in dependence upon user interactions during reproduction of the video programme product.
9. A method according to claim 8, in which the video programme product is a computer game product, and the user interactions are video game interactions.
10. A method according to claim 8 or claim 9, in which the video programme product is a stereoscopic video programme product.
11. Computer software comprising program instructions which, when executed by a computer, cause the computer to perform the method of any one of the preceding claims.
12. A non-transitory machine-readable storage medium which stores computer software according to claim 11.
13. Video processing apparatus comprising: a detector configured to detect, as a reference pose, a pose of an individual at a reference time point in an input video sequence and to detect, at a second, different, time point in the input video sequence, a second pose of the individual; a generator configured to generate from one or more source images of the individual, a transitional video sequence representing a transition of the individual from the second pose to the reference pose; and a processor to associate the transitional video sequence with the input video sequence to generate an output video sequence including at least the transitional video sequence to implement a non-linear replay branch from the second time point to the reference time point.
