</title>

<abstract>
A positioning controller (50) including a forward predictive model (60) and/or inverse control predictive model (70) for positioning control of an interventional device (30) including a portion (40) of an interventional device. In operation, the controller (50) may apply the forward predictive model (60) to a commanded positioning motion of the interventional device (30) to render a predicted navigated pose of the end-effector (40), and generate positioning data informative of a positioning by the interventional device (30) of said portion of interventional device (40) to a target pose based on the predicted navigated pose of said portion (40). Alternatively, antecedently or subsequently, the controller (50) may apply the control predictive model (70) to the target pose of the portion of interventional device (40) to render a predicted positioning motion of the interventional device (30), and generate positioning commands controlling a positioning by the interventional device (30) of said device portion (40) to the target pose based on the predicted positioning motion of the interventional device (30).
