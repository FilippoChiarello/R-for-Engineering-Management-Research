Apparatus and method for data acquisition
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the disclosure may reduce motion noise by mounting vector component sensors on a bottom-weighted instrument platform that is supported with a spherical bearing. An apparatus for data acquisition is provided. The apparatus includes a base assembly, a spherical bearing mounted to the base assembly, and an instrument platform having at least one vector component sensor fixed thereto. The instrument platform is mounted on and supported by the spherical bearing. The spherical bearing couples the instrument platform to the base assembly and allows free angular rotation of the instrument platform, within a tilt angle range. The instrument platform is bottom weighted in that it has a center of mass disposed below its center of rotation. The apparatus may include a controller that receives and/or stores data from the at least one sensor.

<claims>
1. An apparatus for vector component data acquisition comprising: a base assembly; a spherical bearing mounted to the base assembly; and an instrument platform having at least one vector component sensor fixed thereto, the instrument platform being mounted on and supported by the spherical bearing, the spherical bearing thereby coupling the instrument platform to the base assembly and allowing free angular rotation of the instrument platform, within a tilt angle range, about the spherical bearing such that the instrument platform has a center of rotation; wherein the instrument platform has a center of mass disposed below the center of rotation.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the instrument platform is configured to pendulate about the center of rotation such that motion noise within an acquisition band of the at least one vector component sensor is suppressed.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the instrument platform has a natural pendular frequency that is lower than a lowest frequency of an acquisition band of the at least one vector component sensor.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the instrument platform is rigid.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a carrier, the base assembly being coupled to the carrier.
6. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein the carrier comprises a tow frame and a linkage coupling the base assembly to the tow frame.
7. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein the carrier is an airborne carrier configured to be towed by an airborne vehicle.
8. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the spherical bearing is an air bearing.
9. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the spherical bearing comprises the sole mechanical coupling between the base assembly and the instrument platform.
10. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the at least one vector component sensor comprises three independently oriented vector component sensors.
11. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a controller, the controller comprising a processor and memory, wherein the controller receives data from said at least one sensor.
12. The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the controller stores the received data.
13. The apparatus of claim 11, further comprising wireless communication means, wherein the controller causes the wireless communication means to transmit the received data for storage in a database.
14. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the base assembly comprises a pedestal, the spherical bearing being mounted to the pedestal.
15. The apparatus of claim 14, wherein the pedestal comprises a post disposed upwardly from the base assembly.
16. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the at least one vector component sensor comprises at least one of: at least one electromagnetic sensor; at least one gravity sensor.
17. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the at least one vector component sensor comprises at least one gradiometer sensor.
18. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the instrument platform comprises a downward facing skirt, the downward facing skirt providing clearance about the spherical bearing and base assembly to allow the instrument platform a range of tilt rotation within the tilt angle range.
19. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising: a righting system; and an angular motion measurement system, wherein the righting system applies, as a function of angular motion measured by the angular motion measurement system, righting torques to the instrument platform to cause it to rotate about the spherical bearing.
