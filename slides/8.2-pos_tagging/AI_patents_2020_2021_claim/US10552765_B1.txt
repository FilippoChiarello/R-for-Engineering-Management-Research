<title>
Predictive terminal management
</title>

<abstract>
A 3-axis recording movements/acceleration and/or temperature/humidity is integrated into a motherboard of a terminal. Movements and acceleration and/or temperature/humidity experienced by the terminal are captured and logged and reported from the terminal to a predictive management service. The predictive management service correlates the movements and acceleration and/or temperature/humidity with service records to identify patterns. During operation of the terminal, the predictive management service provides predicted service actions needed by the terminal in advance of a problem being experienced by the terminal based on the patterns, and the predictive management service notifies a service management system for performing the service actions.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: obtaining sensor event data comprising movement data or acceleration data from a sensor integrated into a motherboard of a transaction terminal; correlating the sensor event data with transaction data being processed on the terminal and correlating the sensor event data with service data associated with the transaction terminal as sensor-transaction data; providing the sensor-transaction data to a predictive management service to proactively predict a service action on the transaction terminal in advance of a terminal problem being experienced by the transaction terminal; and notifying a service management system that the transaction terminal requires the service action based on identification of the terminal problem by the predictive management service.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein obtaining further includes obtaining the sensor event data as the movement data and the acceleration data detected by the sensor for the transaction terminal during operation of the transaction terminal.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein obtaining further includes acquiring the sensor event data from a 3-axis sensor embedded in the motherboard of the transaction terminal as the sensor, and wherein the sensor includes a temperature/humidity sensor.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein correlating further includes associating the sensor event data with the transaction data based on time stamps associated with the sensor event data and the transaction data.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein correlating further includes including within the sensor-transaction data identifiers for the transaction terminal, a site associated with the transaction terminal, and an operator that is operating the transaction terminal.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein providing further includes providing the sensor-transaction data based on a preconfigured amount of sensor-transaction data being detected.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein providing further includes providing the sensor-transaction data based on a threshold measurement when compared to the sensor event data.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein providing further includes providing the sensor-transaction data based a preconfigured amount of elapsed time since previous sensor-transaction data was sent to the predictive management service.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein providing further includes providing the sensor-transaction data based on a dynamic request made by the predictive management service for the sensor-transaction data.
10. The method of claim 1 further comprising, receiving a warning message with respect to an impending terminal problem identified by the predictive management service and displaying the warning message on a display of the transaction terminal to an operator.
11. The method of claim 1 further comprising, proactively disabling a component of the transaction terminal based on an instruction received from the predictive management service.
12. A method, comprising: receiving sensor-transaction data that includes movement data or acceleration data of a transaction terminal that was captured by a sensor embedded in a motherboard of the transaction terminal and a transaction manager that executes on the transaction terminal; correlating the sensor-transaction data with service data associated with service records for the transaction terminal; identifying by a predictive management service an impending problem for a component of the transaction terminal based on the correlating; and notifying a service management system that the transaction terminal requires a service action based on the impending problem, the component, and the service records.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein receiving further includes obtaining the sensor-transaction data from the transaction terminal based on issuing a pull request for the sensor-transaction data to the transaction terminal.
14. The method of claim 12, wherein receiving further includes obtaining the sensor-transaction data from the transaction terminal at predefined intervals of time.
15. The method of claim 12, wherein correlating further includes providing the service-transaction data as input to a trained machine-learning algorithm, wherein the predictive management service comprises the trained machine-learning algorithm.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein identifying further includes receiving notification of the impending problem as output from the machine learning algorithm.
17. The method of claim 12, wherein identifying further includes matching a pattern in the service-transaction data with a known pattern associated with the impending problem.
18. The method of claim 12 further comprising, sending a warning message for the impending problem to the transaction terminal to display to an operator of the transaction terminal.
19. A transaction terminal, comprising: a motherboard having a processor, memory and a sensor; a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having executable instructions; the processor configured to load the executable instructions from the non-transitory computer-readable storage medium into the memory and execute the executable instructions, which cause the processor to: capture sensor event data provided by the sensor when movement or acceleration of the transaction terminal is detected; correlate the sensor event data with transaction data associated with a transaction being processed on the transaction terminal; provide the correlated sensor-event data to a predictive management system that proactively predicts a problem that is expected to occur on the transaction terminal but has not yet occurred; and notify a service management system that the transaction terminal requires a service action based on the problem.
20. The transaction terminal of claim 19, the transaction terminal is one of: a Point-Of-Sale (POS) terminal, a Self-Service Terminal (SST), an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), a kiosk, a tablet computer, or a laptop computer, and wherein the sensor is a 3-axis sensor.
