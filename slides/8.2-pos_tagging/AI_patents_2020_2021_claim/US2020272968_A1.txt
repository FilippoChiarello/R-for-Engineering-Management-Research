Systems, Methods, and Media for Harmonizing Procurement Across Distribution Networks With Heterogeneous Product Availability
</title>

<abstract>
In accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter, mechanisms (which can, for example, include systems, methods, and media) for harmonizing procurement across distribution networks with heterogeneous product availability are provided. In some embodiments, a method for automatically generating an order guide for a facility associated with an organization is provided, the method comprising: presenting items available in first, second portions of a distribution network; presenting items available via the network; creating a general order guide, and adding a first item thereto; determining that the first item is unavailable and a second item is available in the first portion; identifying substitutes, including the second item, for the first item; generate a facility order guide with items in the first portion based on the general order guide; automatically selecting the second item for the facility order guide; and associating the facility order guide and facility.
