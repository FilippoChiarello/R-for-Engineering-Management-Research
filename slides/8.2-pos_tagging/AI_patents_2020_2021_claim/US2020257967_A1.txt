SELECTING A DISCONNECT FROM DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHANNEL DISCONNECTS BY TRAINING A MACHINE LEARNING MODULE
</title>

<abstract>
Provided are techniques for selecting a disconnect by training a machine learning module. A machine learning module is provided that receives inputs and produces an output. The output produced from the machine learning module based on the inputs for the first I/O operation and an estimated amount of time to acquire resources for a first I/O operation is determined. An actual amount of time to acquire resources for the first I/O operation is determined. The machine learning module is retrained based on the inputs, the output, and the actual amount of time it took to acquire resources for the first I/O operation versus an estimated amount of time to acquire the resources for the first I/O operation. The retrained machine learning module is used to select one of disconnect from a channel, the logical disconnect from the channel, or the physical disconnect from the channel for a second I/O operation.
