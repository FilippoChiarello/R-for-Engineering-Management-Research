<title>
ADAPTING A LIGHTING CONTROL INTERFACE BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF CONVERSATIONAL INPUT
</title>

<abstract>
A system (1) for adapting a lighting control interface is configured to receive a signal indicative of conversational input from a user, analyze the conversational input, determine an activity and a location (14) based on the analysis, select a stored activity matching the activity from a plurality of activities stored in a memory, each of the plurality of activities being associated with a light setting in the memory, obtain a light setting associated with the selected activity from the memory, identify a light device (24) at the location based on the determined location, and adapt a lighting control interface (27) to allow the light device at the location to be controlled according to the determined light setting in response to receiving an input via the lighting control interface.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system (1,41) for adapting a lighting control interface, said system (1,41) comprising:
- at least one input interface (3,43);
- at least one output interface (4,9,44); and
- at least one processor (5,45) configured to use said at least one input interface (3,43) to receive a signal indicative of conversational input from a user, analyze said conversational input, determine an activity and a location based on said analysis, select a stored activity matching said activity from a plurality of activities stored in a memory (7,47), each of said plurality of activities being associated with a light setting in said memory (7,47), obtain a light setting associated with said selected activity from said memory (7,47), identify a light device (21-25) at said determined location, and use said at least one output interface (4,9,44) to adapt said lighting control interface (27-29,31,71) able to control said light device (21-25), to allow said light device (21-25) at said location to be controlled according to said determined light setting in response to receiving an input via said lighting control interface (27-29,31,71).
2. A system (1,41) as claimed in claim 1, wherein said determined location is different than a location of said user when said signal indicative of said conversational input is received.
3. A system (1,41) as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said at least one processor (5,45) is configured to determine said location from said activity.
4. A system (1,41) as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said at least one processor (5,45) is configured to allow said light setting to be controlled according to said determined light setting upon receiving input indicative of expiry of a timer.
5. A system (1,41) as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said lighting control interface comprises a light switch.
6. A system (1,41) as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said at least one processor (5,45) is configured to adapt said lighting control interface (71) upon determining that said user is present at said location.
7. A system (1) as claimed in claim 6, wherein said system comprises a mobile device, said at least one output interface comprises a display (9) of said mobile device and said lighting control interface comprises a user interface (71) displayed on said display (9) of said mobile device.
8. A system (1,41) as claimed in any one of claims 1-6, wherein said at least one output interface comprises a transmitter (4,44) for transmitting a request to adapt said lighting control interface to a device (27-29) comprising said lighting control interface.
9. A system (1,41) as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said at least one processor (5,45) is configured to adapt said lighting control interface (29,31) to allow said light device (21-25) to be controlled according to said determined light setting upon receiving input from a presence sensor (29) indicating that said presence sensor (29) has detected presence in said location.
10. A system (1,41) as claimed in claim 9, wherein said at least one processor (5,45) is configured to identify said user while receiving said signal indicative of said conversational input and adapt said lighting control interface (29,31) to allow said light device (21-25) to be controlled according to said determined light setting in response to said presence sensor (29) detecting presence of said user in said location.
11. A system (1,41) as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said at least one processor (5,45) is configured to determine a plurality of candidate locations based on said signal indicative of said conversational input and select said location from said plurality of candidate locations based on an identity of said user, a location of said user when said signal indicative of conversational input was received and/or a history of light setting activations stored in a memory (7,47).
12. A system (1,41) as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said at least one processor (5,45) is configured to determine a plurality of candidate activities and associated probabilities based on said signal indicative of said conversational input and select said activity from said plurality of candidate activities based on said associated probabilities.
13. A system (1,41) as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said signal indicative of said conversational input comprises an audio signal or text.
14. A method of adapting a lighting control interface, said method comprising:
- receiving (101) a signal indicative of conversational input from a user;
- analyzing (103) said conversational input;
- determining (105) an activity and a location based on said analysis;
- selecting (107) a stored activity matching said activity from a plurality of activities stored in a memory, each of said plurality of activities being associated with a light setting;
- obtaining (109) a light setting associated with said selected activity;
- identifying (111) a light device at said determined location; and
- adapting (113) said lighting control interface able to control said light device, to allow said light device at said location to be controlled according to said determined light setting in response to receiving an input via said lighting control interface.
15. A computer program or suite of computer programs comprising at least one software code portion or a computer program product storing at least one software code portion, the software code portion, when run on a computer system, being configured for enabling the method of claim 14 to be performed.
