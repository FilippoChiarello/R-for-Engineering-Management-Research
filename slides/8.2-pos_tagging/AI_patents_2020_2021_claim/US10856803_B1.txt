Method and apparatus for closed-loop brain stimulation
</title>

<abstract>
A closed loop brain stimulation system includes a means for reading electrophysiological signals from the brain; means for reading other biometric signals; means for stimulating the brain; and a control algorithm that dynamically adjusts the parameters of stimulation to minimize a reference utility function that computes the difference between the current and desired brain states, and current and desired biometric states.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A closed loop brain stimulation system, comprising: means for reading electrophysiological signals from the brain; means for reading other biometric signals; means for stimulating the brain; means for mixing a feed-forward signal and a feedback signal for generating a signal for transmission to the means for stimulating the brain; an inverse model module configured to receive desired features and compute the feed-forward signal; and a control algorithm that dynamically adjusts a mixing process affecting brain stimulation to minimize a reference utility function, including a cumulative measure of the difference between the current and desired brain states, and current and desired biometric states.
2. The system according to claim 1, wherein the algorithm is adapted to assess, via internal model, the effect of perturbing the multiple stimulation parameters, singly, or in groups, and adjust the parameters to maximally influence a given biomarker in a desired direction.
3. The system according to claim 1, wherein, when the brain is stimulated by the means for stimulating the brain at an individual's dominant frequency in the 8-12 Hz band, the control algorithm assesses that dominant frequency, and then transmits a signal to the means for stimulating the brain at that same frequency.
4. The system according to claim 3, wherein the control algorithm adjusts the frequency.
5. The system according to claim 1, wherein the algorithm is adapted to examine data from the signals, determines brain state, and adjusts parameters for a subsequent round of stimulation in order to modulate the brain from the determined state to the desired state.
6. The system according to claim 1, wherein the system accounts for individual differences in neuroanatomy and neurophysiology.
7. The system according to claim 1, wherein the system dynamically adjusts over time within an individual profile.
8. The system according to claim 1, wherein the system reads from multiple sources of inputs, including multiple brain-based biomarkers and multiple biometric signals.
9. The system according to claim 1, wherein the system optimizes with respect to multiple stimulation parameters and complex montages of stimulation.
10. The system according to claim 1, wherein the system is adapted to treat major depressive disorder with TES and EEG as the respective stimulation and reading methods, and with the incorporation of other biometric signals indicative of the depressed state.
11. The system according to claim 1, wherein the system is adapted to treat ADHD with TES and EEG as the respective stimulation and reading methods, and with the incorporation of other biometric signals indicative of the hyperactive state.
12. The system according to claim 1, wherein the system is adapted to enhance cognitive and/or perceptual skills, by first identifying the activated areas of the cortex during these processes, in an individualized fashion, and then stimulating them in order to accelerate associative learning within the task.
13. The system according to claim 1, wherein the system is adapted to enhance the suppression of the left hemisphere and/or the enhancement of the right hemisphere by various monitored means in order enhance creativity in open ended task such as drawing and more closed tasks such as difficult problem solving.
14. The system according to claim 1, wherein the system is adapted to enhance motor skills by first constructing an individualized biomarker model distinguishing between brain states that lead to successful motor events and those that don't, and then applying the closed loop system to achieve these successful states.
15. The system according to claim 1, wherein the system is portable.
16. The system according to claim 1, wherein the system adjusts stimulation frequency to effect a minimization or maximization of mean frequency response, or to enhance the relative power of a particular band of frequencies.
17. A closed loop brain stimulation system, comprising: means for reading electrophysiological signal from the brain; means for reading other biometric signals; means for stimulating the brain; and a control algorithm that dynamically adjusts a mixing process affecting brain stimulation to minimize a reference utility function, including a cumulative measure of the difference between the current and desired brain states, and current and desired biometric states, wherein the algorithm effects a continuous adjustment between alternating current and direct current via adjustment of a duty cycle parameter.
18. A closed loop brain stimulation system, comprising: means for reading electrophysiological signals from the brain; means for reading other biometric signals; means for stimulating the brain; and a control algorithm that dynamically adjusts a mixing process affecting brain stimulation to minimize a reference utility function, including a cumulative measure of the difference between the current and desired brain states, and current and desired biometric states.
