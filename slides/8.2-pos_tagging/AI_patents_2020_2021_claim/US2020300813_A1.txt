CONTACT ELEMENTS FOR ACOUSTIC EXCITATION ATTACHED VIA A COMPLIANT MATERIAL
</title>

<abstract>
A system includes: an acoustic exciter; a compliant material applied to the acoustic exciter to configure the acoustic exciter for triggering acoustic excitation of at least part of a substrate; a sensor configured to receive an acoustic response of the acoustic excitation; and circuitry configured to determine at least one characteristic of the substrate using the acoustic response.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: an acoustic exciter; a compliant material applied to the acoustic exciter to configure the acoustic exciter for triggering acoustic excitation of at least part of a substrate; a sensor configured to receive an acoustic response of the acoustic excitation; and circuitry configured to determine at least one characteristic of the substrate using the acoustic response.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the acoustic exciter includes a contact element configured for triggering the acoustic excitation.
3. The system of claim 2, including multiple contact elements, the contact elements individually movable relative to the compliant material.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein at least some of the contact elements are chain links.
5. The system of claim 2, wherein the contact element is spherical.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the compliant material includes a spring in contact with the contact element.
7. The system of claim 5, wherein the compliant material includes an adhesive material in contact with the contact element.
8. The system of claim 5, further comprising a mesh that constrains the contact element against the compliant material.
9. The system of claim 1, further comprising a wheel that includes at least part of the compliant material, the acoustic exciter positioned on a perimeter of the wheel.
10. The system of claim 9, including multiple acoustic exciters, wherein the acoustic exciters form a circumferential band on the perimeter of the wheel.
11. The system of claim 10, further comprising cross ties to which the circumferential band is coupled.
12. The system of claim 9, further comprising an active source configured to drive the wheel.
13. The system of claim 9, further comprising a movable subsystem that includes at least the acoustic exciter and the compliant material, the movable subsystem configured to facilitate placement of the acoustic exciter in and out of contact with the substrate.
14. The system of claim 1, including multiple acoustic exciters and multiple sensors, wherein the circuitry is configured for multi-channel registration of respective acoustic responses received by the multiple sensors.
15. The system of claim 1, further comprising a location detector, wherein the circuitry is further configured to identify the substrate using input from the location detector.
16. The system of claim 1, wherein the sensor includes a microphone.
17. An apparatus comprising: a wheel including a compliant material; and one or more circumferential bands of acoustic exciters positioned around a periphery of the wheel, wherein the compliant material configures the acoustic exciters for triggering acoustic excitation of at least part of a substrate.
18. The apparatus of claim 17, further comprising an active source configured to drive the wheel.
19. The apparatus of claim 17, wherein the wheel includes a peripheral surface that has an approximately circular cross section, and wherein the at least one circumferential band is positioned around the peripheral surface.
20. The apparatus of claim 19, further comprising cross ties traversing the peripheral surface, the acoustic exciters coupled to the cross ties.
21. The apparatus of claim 19, wherein the apparatus includes at least two circumferential bands of the acoustic exciters positioned adjacent respective edges of the peripheral surface.
22. A system comprising: means for triggering acoustic excitation of at least part of a substrate; a compliant material applied to the means; and a sensor configured to receive an acoustic response of the acoustic excitation.
