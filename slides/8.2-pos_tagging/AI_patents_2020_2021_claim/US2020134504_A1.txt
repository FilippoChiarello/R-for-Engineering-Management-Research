SYSTEM AND METHOD OF TRAINING BEHAVIOR LABELING MODEL
</title>

<abstract>
A system of training behavior labeling model is provided. Specifically, a processing unit inputs each data of a training data set into a plurality of learning modules to establish a plurality of labeling models. The processing unit obtains a plurality of second labeling information corresponding to each data of a verification data set and generates a behavior labeling result according to the second labeling information corresponding to each data of the verification data set. The processing unit obtains a labeling change value according to the behavior labeling result and first labeling information corresponding to each data of the verification data set. The processing unit, if determining that the labeling change value is greater than a change threshold, updates the first labeling information according to the behavior labeling results, exchanges the training data set and the verification data set and reestablishes the labeling models.
