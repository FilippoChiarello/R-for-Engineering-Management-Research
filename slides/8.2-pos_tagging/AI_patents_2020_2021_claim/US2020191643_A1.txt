<title>
Human Activity Classification and Identification Using Structural Vibrations
</title>

<abstract>
The current disclosure is directed to classifying/identifying an action based on the vibrations caused in/on/around a structure by the action and providing a confidence level association between the vibration and the action that caused the vibration.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system for classifying actions based on vibrations comprising: at least one sensor; at least one data collector that receives information from the at least one sensor; a processor analyzing a vibration signal obtained from the information received from the at least one sensor, wherein the processor determines time domain components and/or frequency domain components of the vibration signal; and a classifier that employs at least one algorithm to analyze the time domain components and/or frequency domain components of the vibration signal, wherein the classifier associates the time domain components and/or frequency domain components of the vibration signal with a known action.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the known action comprises a form of human activity.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the known action comprises a form of activity other than human activity.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one sensor comprises a vibration measuring sensor.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the time domain component comprises amplitude, zero-crossing rate, and/or duration.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the frequency domain components comprises Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and/or power density.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the classifier provides a probability assessment that correlates the vibration signal to a known action within a predefined confidence level.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein at least one machine learning or artificial intelligence associates the time domain components and/or frequency domain components of the vibration signal with the known action.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein sound or vibration components are processed from the vibration signal prior to the at least one algorithm being used to analyze the time domain components and/or frequency domain components of the vibration signal.
10. A method for categorizing actions based on vibrations comprising: detecting at least one vibration; converting the at least one vibration into information; obtaining at least one vibration signal from the information; determining time domain components and/or frequency domain components of the vibration signal; analyzing the time domain components and/or frequency domain components of the vibration signal; and associating the time domain components and/or frequency domain components of the vibration signal with a known action.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the known action comprises a form of human activity.
12. The system of claim 10, wherein the known action comprises a form of activity other than human activity.
13. The system of claim 10, wherein the at least one sensor comprises a vibration measuring sensor.
14. The system of claim 10, wherein the time domain component comprises maximum amplitude, zero-crossing rate, and/or duration.
15. The system of claim 10, wherein the frequency domain components comprises Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and/or power density.
16. The system of claim 10, wherein the classifier provides a probability assessment that correlates the vibration signal to a known action within a predefined confidence level.
17. The system of claim 10, wherein at least one machine learning, deep learning, or artificial intelligence associates the time domain components and/or frequency domain components of the vibration signal with the known action.
18. The system of claim 10, wherein sound or vibration components are processed from the vibration signal prior to the at least one algorithm being used to analyze the time domain components and/or frequency domain components of the vibration signal.
