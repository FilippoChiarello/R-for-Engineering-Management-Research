<title>
System and method for flexible manufacturing
</title>

<abstract>
The system performs a process for creating robotic control code for manufacturing products. A Designer UI displays virtual parts and receives inputs for processing and assembling the virtual parts that are required to create a virtual product. The designer identifies options for processing and assembling the virtual parts which are displayed on the user interface. The robot abilities and the options are selected to optimize a metric of the product manufacturing. The inventive toolset produces the robot control codes for performing a sequence of robotic abilities with the selected options to product the product. The robot control codes are used by a simulator which manipulates virtual robots and virtual parts to create a virtual product to check the robot control code. The verified robot control code is used to control real robots to create the product.
