<title>
Pharmaceutical agents targeting cancer stem cells
</title>

<abstract>
Methods for preventing or treating subjects having cancer based on the identification of pharmaceutical agents that target cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified. These methods include administering to the subject an effective amount of a COX2 inhibitor and an effective amount of a YAP1 inhibitor. In addition, methods of enhancing chemotherapeutic responses in cancer patients have been discovered and are described herein.

<claims>
1. A method for treating cancer in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX 2) inhibitor and a yes-associated protein 1 (YAP 1) inhibitor and wherein the cancer is selected from the group consisting of bladder cancer and urothelial carcinoma.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the COX 2 inhibitor is celecoxib or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or stereoisomer thereof.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the YAP1 inhibitor is verteporfin, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or stereoisomer thereof.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein the subject is also administered one or more other chemotherapy agents.
5. A method for treating cancer in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a celecoxib, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or stereoisomer thereof, and an effective amount of verteporfin, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or stereoisomer thereof, and wherein the cancer is selected from the group consisting of bladder cancer and urothelial carcinoma.
6. The method of claim 5 wherein the subject is also administered one or more other chemotherapy agents.
7. A method of enhancing a chemotherapeutic response in a subject having cancer comprising the following steps: a) administering an effective amount of COX2 inhibitor to the subject; b) administering an effective amount of YAP1 inhibitor to the subject; c) administering an effective amount of a chemotherapy agent to the subject, wherein the cancer is selected from the group consisting of bladder cancer and urothelial carcinoma.
8. The method of claim 7 wherein the cancer patient is administered an effective amount of COX2 inhibitor and YAP1 inhibitor prior to the administering the chemotherapy agent.
9. The method of claim 7 wherein the cancer patient is administered an effective amount of chemotherapy agent prior to the administering of COX 2 inhibitor.
10. The method of claim 7 wherein the COX 2 inhibitor is celecoxib or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or stereoisomer thereof.
11. The method of claim 7 wherein the YAP1 inhibitor is verteporfin, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or stereoisomer thereof.
12. A method for treating cancer in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a EP4 antagonist and an effective amount of a COX2 inhibitor and wherein the cancer is selected from the group consisting of bladder cancer and urothelial carcinoma.
13. The method of claim 12 wherein the COX2 inhibitor is etodolac.
14. A method for treating cancer in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a EGFR inhibitor an effective amount of a COX 2 inhibitor and an effective amount of a YAP 1 inhibitor, and wherein the cancer is selected from the group consisting of bladder cancer and urothelial carcinoma.
15. The method of claim 14 wherein the subject is administered a YAP1 inhibitor in addition to the EGFR inhibitor and the COX 2 inhibitor.
16. The method of claim 4, wherein the one or more chemotherapy agents comprise gemcitabine or cisplatin.
17. The method of claim 6, wherein the one or more chemotherapy agents comprise gemcitabine or cisplatin.
18. The method of claim 7, wherein the one or more chemotherapy agents comprise gemcitabine or cisplatin.
19. The method of claim 12, wherein the EP4 antagonist is ONO-AE3-208.
20. The method of claim 14, wherein the method further comprises administering to the subject one or more chemotherapy agents comprising gemcitabine and/or cisplatin.
21. The method of claim 14 wherein the COX 2 inhibitor is celecoxib or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or stereoisomer thereof.
22. The method of claim 14 wherein the YAP1 inhibitor is verteporfin, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or stereoisomer thereof.
23. A method for EGFR inhibitor resistant bladder cancer or urothelial carcinoma cancer in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a an effective amount of a COX 2 inhibitor and an effective amount of a YAP 1 inhibitor.
24. The method of claim 23 wherein the COX 2 inhibitor is celecoxib or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or stereoisomer thereof.
25. The method of claim 23 wherein the YAP1 inhibitor is verteporfin, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or stereoisomer thereof.
26. The method of claim 23 wherein the subject is also administered one or more other chemotherapy agents.
27. The method of claim 26, wherein the one or more chemotherapy agents comprise gemcitabine or cisplatin.
28. The method of claim 26, wherein the one or more chemotherapy agents comprises an EGFR inhibitor.
