<title>
Multi-gesture media recording system
</title>

<abstract>
A computer implemented method and system for recording media data such as audio data in one or more communication modes based on gestures on a graphical user interface (GUI) of an electronic device is provided. A gesture based media recording application (GBMRA) provided on the electronic device defines multiple interface regions on the GUI. The GBMRA detects a gesture on an interface region and performs a first action associated with recording of the media data in a communication mode. The GBMRA detects another gesture on the same interface region or another interface region and performs a second action. The first action and the second action include at least one of triggering recording of the media data, switching from one communication mode to another for recording the media data, canceling recording of the media data, generating and displaying multiple options for performing an operation associated with the recorded media data, etc.
