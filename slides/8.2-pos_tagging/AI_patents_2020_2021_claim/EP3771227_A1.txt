CALIBRATION OF AUDIO PLAYBACK DEVICES
</title>

<claims>
1. A method (800, 900, 1000) comprising: outputting (802) first audio content by a speaker of an audio playback device located in a particular room; receiving (902) an indication of the output first audio content by a microphone of the audio playback device; based on the received indication of the output first audio content, determining (904, 1002) a first acoustic response of the particular room, the first acoustic response comprising a microphone location response; determining a second acoustic response of the room by mapping the microphone location response to a set of room responses and an associated set of microphone location responses, wherein each room response in the set of room responses is an acoustic response of a respective room based on audio content detected at one or more spatial locations in the respective room, wherein the second acoustic response is indicative of an approximated acoustic response of the particular room at a spatial location different from a spatial location of the microphone; and adjusting (910), based on the second acoustic response, audio content output by the speaker.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the mapping is defined by a set of microphone location responses and a set of second acoustic responses; wherein a response of the set of microphone location responses is an acoustic response of a given room at a fixed location and the set of second acoustic responses is based on acoustic responses at a plurality of spatial locations different from the fixed location in the given room, and wherein the mapping maps each one of the responses of the set of microphone location responses to a corresponding, respective one of the responses of the set of second acoustic responses.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the first acoustic response is one of (i) a spectral response indicating how a volume of the first audio content received by the microphone varies with frequency, (ii) a spatial response indicating how the volume of the first audio content received by the microphone varies with a direction and/or the spatial location in the room, and (iii) a temporal response indicating how the first audio content changes within the room with respect to a reverberation, a delay, a decay or a phase of the first audio content, wherein the second acoustic response is one of a said spectral response, a said spatial response and a said temporal response, and wherein the mapping is a difference between a response of the set of first acoustic responses and a corresponding, respective response of the set of second acoustic responses.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein applying the mapping comprises determining (1004) a distance metric between the first acoustic response and a response of each of the set of first acoustic responses, wherein the distance metric includes a clustering algorithm or a classification algorithm.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the distances are used to create weightings that are inverse to a distance or to a squared distance between the first acoustic response and a particular response of the set of first acoustic responses.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the mapping corresponds to a sum of the weighted set of first acoustic responses.
7. The method of any preceding claim, further comprising weighting the mapping according to an acoustic configuration of the audio playback device.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the acoustic configuration of the audio playback device is stored as a state variable.
9. The method of any preceding claim, further comprising storing the first acoustic response on a server in communication with the audio playback device, wherein applying the mapping comprises sending the first acoustic response to a remote server in communication with the audio playback device and receiving the second acoustic response from the remote server.
10. The method of claim 9, in combination with claim 2, wherein the set of first acoustic responses and the set of second acoustic responses and mappings between a plurality of rooms are stored in a database, wherein the second acoustic response received from the remote server is obtained from the database.
11. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the first audio content and the adjusted audio content are different portions of a same song.
12. A computer readable storage medium including instructions for execution by a processor, the instructions, when executed, cause the processor to implement a method according to any preceding claim.
13. An audio playback device (200, 532, 534, 536, 538, 702) comprising: a microphone (220, 704); a speaker (212); a processor (202) comprising instructions, which when executed, cause the processor to perform a method according to one of claims 1 to 11.
