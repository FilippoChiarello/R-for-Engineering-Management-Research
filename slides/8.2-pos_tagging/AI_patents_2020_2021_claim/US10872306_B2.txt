<title>
Facilitating retrieval of items from an electronic device
</title>

<abstract>
The subject disclosure relates to facilitating a transmission of data, information or instructions between a mobile device and an electronic storage device. In an aspect, a system is described comprising a detection component that detects, by an application executing on a first device, signal data corresponding to a second device. In another aspect, the system can comprise a requesting component that requests, by the application executing on the first device, from a third device a set of storage data corresponding to the second device. In yet another aspect, the system can comprise a transmission component that transmits, by the third device, a first subset of storage data or a second subset of storage data to the application executing on the first device, based on identification data associated with the first device, wherein the first subset of storage data represents instructions to open one or more compartment elements of the second device, and wherein the second subset of storage data represents an information corresponding to an absence of stored items at the second device.
