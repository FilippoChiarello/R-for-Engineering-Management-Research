<title>
OBJECT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM, AUTOMOBILE, VEHICULAR LAMP FITTING, AND METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING TYPE OF OBJECT
</title>

<abstract>
A three-dimensional sensor 20 generates multiple items of line data LD<sub>1</sub> through LD<sub>N</sub> with respect to multiple horizontal lines L<sub>1</sub> through L<sub>N</sub> arranged at different heights. Multiple first neural networks 72 each generate first intermediate data MD relating to a corresponding item from among the multiple items of line data L<sub>D</sub>. Each first intermediate data MD<sub>1</sub> indicates the probability of matching between the corresponding line data and each of multiple portions of multiple kinds. A combining processing unit 74 receives the multiple items of first intermediate data MD<sub>1</sub>, and combines the first intermediate data thus received so as to generate at least one item of second intermediate data MD<sub>2</sub>. A second neural network 76 receives the at least one item of second intermediate data MD<sub>2</sub>, and generates final data FD that indicates the probability of matching between the object OBJ and each of the multiple kinds.
