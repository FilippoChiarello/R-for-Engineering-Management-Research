EXERCISE ASSISTANT DEVICE AND EXERCISE ASSISTANT METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a device for assisting exercise, comprising a video providing unit configured to provide a first video data including a first exercise movement, a data obtaining unit configured to obtain a second video data based on an input relating to the first video data, a joint information extracting unit configured to extract a first joint information obtained by detecting plural skeletons from the second video data, an analyzing unit configured to obtain an analysis information based on a similarity determined by comparing the first joint information with a second joint information of the first video data and a recommendation unit configured to obtain recommendation information for recommending an exercise movement to a user based on at least one of the first video data, the second video data and the analysis information from a database including plural exercise movements may be provided according to an embodiment.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A Device for assisting exercise, comprising a video providing unit configured to provide a first video data including a first exercise movement; a data obtaining unit configured to obtain a second video data based on an input relating to the first video data; a joint information extracting unit configured to extract a first joint information obtained by detecting plural skeletons from the second video data; an analyzing unit configured to obtain an analysis information based on a similarity determined by comparing the first joint information with a second joint information of the first video data; and a recommendation unit configured to obtain recommendation information for recommending an exercise movement to a user based on at least one of the first video data, the second video data and the analysis information from a database including plural exercise movements.
2. The device of the claim 1, wherein the video providing unit configured to provide the first video data while the second exercise movement is performed.
3. The device of the claim 1, wherein the first joint information is obtained for each of frames included in the second video data, wherein each of the frames is obtained based on a first interval, wherein the first joint information is obtained by extracting a skeleton corresponding to a body part out of plural skeletons which are included in each of the frames included in the second video data.
4. The device of the claim 3, wherein the second joint information is obtained for each of frames included in the first video data, wherein each of the frames is obtained based on a second interval, wherein the first joint information is obtained by extracting a skeleton corresponding to a body part out of plural skeletons which are included in each of the frames included in the first video data.
5. The device of the claim 4, wherein the analyzing unit configured to compare the first joint information with the second joint information, wherein the first joint information and the second joint information are normalized such that the first interval and the second interval correspond to each other.
6. The device of the claim 1, wherein the analyzing unit configured to obtain an analysis information calculated based on a following equation, A is a vector value of the first joint information, B is a vector value of the second joint information, and Î¸t is a predetermined threshold value
7. The device of the claim 6, wherein when a similarity included in the analysis information is greater than or equal to a predetermined value, the recommendation unit increases at least one of exercise intensity, number of performance, and performance velocity per for the first video data, or recommends an exercise movement which has a higher level of difficulty than the first video data.
8. The device of claim 6, Wherein when a similarity included in the analysis information is smaller than or equal to a predetermined value, the recommendation unit decreases at least one of exercise intensity, number of performance, and performance velocity for the first video data, or recommends an exercise movement which has a lower level of difficulty than the first video data.
9. The device of claim 1, wherein the second exercise movement is based on imitating movements of a user for the first video data
10. The device of claim 1, wherein the analysis information includes at least one of accuracy, number of performances, a movement time, a performance velocity of movement and an ability of each body part.
11. The device of claim 3, wherein the performance number of the second exercise movement is measured based on a change of location of the first joint information.
12. The device of claim 1, wherein the analysis information includes first analysis information which analyzes a performance ability for plural body parts, wherein the recommendation information includes a required exercise movement to at least a part of the plural body parts based on the first analysis information.
13. The device of claim 12, wherein the plural body parts include at least one of an entire body, an upper body, a lower body, an abdominal region and arms.
14. The device of claim 1, wherein the recommendation unit recommends an exercise movement based on at least one of the first video data, the second video data, and the analysis information and pre-obtained a first information, wherein the first information is an information which is obtained from a client device related to a user performing the first exercise movement.
15. The device of claim 14, wherein the first information includes at least one of gender, age, condition of health, information of BMI, cycle of exercise, amount of exercise and intensity of exercise.
16. A method for assisting exercise, the method including, providing a video providing a first video data including a first exercise movement; obtaining a second video data including a second exercise movement obtained by responding to an input of the first video data; extracting a fist joint information obtained by detecting plural skeleton from the second video data; providing analysis information based on a similarity determined by comparing the first joint information with the second joint information of the first video data; and providing a recommendation information recommends an exercise movement based on at least one of the first video data, the second video data and the analysis information from a data base including plural exercise movements, in order to recommend an appropriate exercise movement to a user.
17. A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium having recorded thereon one or more program comprising commands for executing the method of the claim 16.
