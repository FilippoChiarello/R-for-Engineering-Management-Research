<title>
LEARNING DEVICE, SIMULATION SYSTEM, LEARNING METHOD, AND STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A learning device includes a plurality of individual learners. Each of the individual learners includes a planner configured to generate information for defining an operation of the operation subject corresponding to itself, and a reward deriver configured to derive a reward obtained by evaluating information to be evaluated including feedback information obtained from a simulator by inputting information based on the information for defining the operation of the operation subject to the simulator. The planner performs reinforcement learning based on the reward derived by the reward deriver, and at least two of the plurality of individual learners are different in the operations of the operation subject in which the reward derived by the reward deriver is maximized.

<claims>
1. A learning device comprising a plurality of individual learners each associated with an operation subject, wherein each of the individual learners comprises: a planner configured to generate information for defining an operation of the operation subject corresponding to itself; and a reward deriver configured to derive a reward obtained by evaluating information to be evaluated including feedback information obtained from a simulator by inputting information based on the information for defining the operation of the operation subject to the simulator, the planner performs reinforcement learning based on the reward derived by the reward deriver, and at least two of the plurality of individual learners are different in the operations of the operation subject in which the reward derived by the reward deriver is maximized
2. The learning device according to claim 1, wherein at least two of the plurality of individual learners are different in operation characteristics of the operation subject that becomes a premise that the planner generates the information.
3. The learning device according to claim 1, wherein at least two of the plurality of individual learners are different in rules for the reward deriver to evaluate the information to be evaluated.
4. The learning device according to claim 1, wherein the operation is movement.
5. A simulation system comprising: the learning device according to claim 1; and the simulator.
6. A learning method of causing a computer to function as a plurality of individual learners each associated with an operation subject, wherein each of the individual learners is configured to: generate information for defining an operation of the operation subject corresponding to itself; derive a reward obtained by evaluating information to be evaluated including feedback information obtained from a simulator by inputting information based on the information for defining the operation of the operation subject to the simulator; and perform reinforcement learning based on the derived reward, and at least two of the plurality of individual learners are different in the operations of the operation subject in which the reward is maximized.
7. A computer-readable non-transitory storage medium storing a program that causes a computer to function as a plurality of individual learners each associated with an operation subject, wherein each of the individual learners is configured to: generate information for defining an operation of the operation subject corresponding to itself; derive a reward obtained by evaluating information to be evaluated including feedback information obtained from a simulator by inputting information based on the information for defining the operation of the operation subject to the simulator; and perform reinforcement learning based on the derived reward, and at least two of the plurality of individual learners are different in the operations of the operation subject in which the reward is maximized.
