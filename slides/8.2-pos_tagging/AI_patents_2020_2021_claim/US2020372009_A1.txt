ANOMALY LOCATION IDENTIFICATION DEVICE, ANOMALY LOCATION IDENTIFICATION METHOD, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
An anomaly location identification device includes a determination unit configured to determine presence or absence of an anomaly by inputting part or all of information items output from a plurality of devices into an anomaly detection algorithm; a calculation unit configured to calculate, in response to a determination made by the determination unit that an anomaly is present, with respect to one of the information items, an index indicating a degree of contribution to the anomaly; and an identification unit configured to perform calculation by an analysis algorithm using a causal model receiving the index as input, to identify an anomalous device, to improve the precision and calculation speed related to identification of an anomaly location.
