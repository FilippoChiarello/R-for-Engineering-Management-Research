METHODS OF ASSAYING PROTEINS
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems for identifying a protein within a sample are provided herein. A panel of antibodies are acquired, none of which are specific for a single protein or family of proteins. Additionally, the binding properties of the antibodies in the panel are determined. Further, the protein is iteratively exposed to a panel of antibodies. Additionally, a set of antibodies which bind the protein are determined. The identity of the protein is determined using one or more deconvolution methods based on the known binding properties of the antibodies to match the set of antibodies to a sequence of a protein.

<claims>
1. A method of determining characteristics of a plurality of proteins, the method comprising: obtaining a substrate having portions of the plurality of proteins conjugated to the substrate such that each individual protein portion has a unique, optically resolvable, spatial address; applying one or more fluids to the substrate, wherein the one or more fluids comprise a series of n affinity reagents, wherein each of the n affinity reagents is configured to bind specifically to one or more epitopes of a portion of the plurality of proteins, and wherein each of then affinity reagents is linked to an identifiable tag; after each application of the one or more fluids to the substrate, performing the following: observing one or more signals of the identifiable tags linked to affinity reagents that are bound specifically to the one or more epitopes of the portion of the plurality of proteins; identifying one or more unique spatial addresses of the substrate having the one or more observed signals; determining that each portion of the plurality of proteins having an identified unique spatial address contains the one or more epitopes having specifically bound affinity reagents linked to identifiable tags having the one or more observed signals; and determining the characteristics of each protein portion each having an identified unique spatial address containing one or more epitopes having specifically bound affinity reagents linked to identifiable tags having the one or more observed signals.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein each of the n affinity reagents is specific to an individual protein or protein family.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein each of the n affinity reagents is specific to one or more individual distinguishable proteins.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein each of the n affinity reagents recognizes a family of one or more epitopes that are present in more than one proteins.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the epitope of the portion of plurality of proteins is conformational or linear.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the n affinity reagents comprise contiguous or non-contiguous amino acids that are specific to the corresponding epitopes.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining the identity of the portion of the plurality of proteins to a threshold degree of accuracy based on the determined one or more epitopes within the portion.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the n affinity reagents comprise more than 100 affinity reagents.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising using at least one affinity reagent which binds a single protein or single protein isoform.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining the identity of the portion of the plurality of proteins to a threshold degree of accuracy based on the pattern of binding of the affinity reagents.
11. (canceled)
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the portions of the plurality of proteins are conjugated to the substrate using a photo-activatable linker.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the portions of the plurality of proteins are conjugated to the substrate using a photo-cleavable linker.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein at least one of n affinity reagents is modified to be conjugated to an identifiable tag.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein the identifiable tag is a fluorescent tag.
16. (canceled)
17. The method of claim 1, wherein the number of unique spatial addresses occupied by an identified portion of a protein is counted to quantify the level of that protein in the sample.
18. The method of claim 1, wherein the identity of the portion of the plurality of proteins is determined using deconvolution software.
19. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining the portion of plurality of proteins by decoding combinations of epitopes associated with unique spatial addresses.
20. The method of claim 1, further comprising: denaturing the plurality of proteins prior to conjugating the portion of the plurality of proteins to the substrate.
21. The method of claim 1, wherein the portion of the plurality of proteins conjugated to a substrate are present in a complex mixture of multiple proteins.
22. The method of claim 1, wherein the method is used to identify multiple proteins.
