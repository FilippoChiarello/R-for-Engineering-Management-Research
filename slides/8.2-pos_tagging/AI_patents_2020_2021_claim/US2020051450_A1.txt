<abstract>
The invention provides an audio-visual teaching platform, which includes an analysis subsystem, a recommendation subsystem and a training subsystem. The analysis subsystem provides a learning behavior data to enable the recommendation subsystem to generate at least one presumptive learning mode by using the learning behavior data, thereby generating a recommended learning combination. When the training subsystem receives the recommended learning combination, the training subsystem transmits an audio-visual knowledge content which is set to a user for watching and learning. Accordingly, the invention recommends the audio-visual knowledge content to the users with the same or similar presumptive learning mode, and analyzes the interaction between the users and the audio-visual knowledge content, so as to enable the users to really watch the audio-visual knowledge content and enhance their interest in learning.
