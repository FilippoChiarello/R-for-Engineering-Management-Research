RETRIEVAL DEVICE, RETRIEVAL METHOD, AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT
</title>

<abstract>
According to one embodiment, a retrieval device includes one or more processors configured to retrieve a plurality of search image regions from an intended image through image search using a search query, extract a plurality of learning image regions from a learning image used in learning of the image search, through the image search using the search query, and display the search image regions and the learning image regions on a display.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A retrieval device comprising: one or more hardware processors configured to: retrieve a plurality of search image regions from a particular image by conducting an image search using a search query; extract a plurality of learning image regions from a learning image used in an image search learning process, by conducting the image search using the search query; and display the plurality of search image regions and the plurality of learning image regions on a display.
2. The device according to claim 1, wherein the one or more processors: analyze a first region attribute comprising an attribute of an image region of the particular image; convert the search query into one or more search attributes, and retrieve, as the plurality of search image regions, the image region of the particular image comprising the first region attribute with a similarity score with respect to the one or more search attributes equal to or higher than a threshold score.
3. The device according to claim 2, wherein the one or more search attribute comprises at least one of name, color, pattern, shape, length, size, age, gender, or behavior.
4. The device according to claim 2, further comprising a storage that stores therein the learning image and a second region attribute comprising an attribute of an image region of the learning image, wherein the one or more processors extract, as the plurality of learning image regions, the image region of the learning image comprising the second region attribute with the similarity score with respect to the one or more search attributes equal to or higher than the threshold score.
5. The device according to claim 4, wherein the one or more processors: receive selection of one of the displayed plurality of learning image regions and set the second region attribute of the selected learning image region as a search reference for the one or more search attributes used in extraction of the selected learning image region, and when retrieving the image using the search attribute with the search reference, retrieve, as the plurality of search image regions, the image region comprising the first region attribute with the similarity score with respect to the second region attribute set as the one or more search references equal to or higher than the threshold score.
6. The device according to claim 5, wherein the one or more processors: store, in the storage, the search attribute with the search reference and the second region attribute set as the search reference in association with each other, and check whether the converted search attribute has the search reference set, by referring to the storage, and when the search reference is set as the search attribute, retrieve, as the plurality of search image regions, the image region comprising the first region attribute with the similarity score with respect to the second region attribute set as the search reference equal to or higher than the threshold score.
7. The device according to claim 5, wherein the one or more processors display, on the display, display information comprising a search-reference selection section and a search-result display section, the search-reference selection section displays the plurality of learning image regions in descending order of the similarity score to receive selection of the search reference from the plurality of learning image regions, the search-result display section displays the plurality of search image regions in descending order of the similarity score.
8. The device according to claim 7, wherein the one or more processors display the search-result display section on the display, and then display the search-reference selection section on the display after elapse of a certain period of time.
9. The device according to claim 7, wherein the one or more processors convert each of the plurality of learning image regions into an icon image corresponding to the second region attribute of each learning image region to display the search-reference selection section showing icon images instead of the plurality of learning image regions on the display.
10. The device according to claim 1, wherein the one or more processors issue a notification of an anomaly in the retrieval device.
11. A retrieval method, comprising: retrieving a plurality of search image regions from a particular image by conducting an image search using a search query; extracting a plurality of learning image regions from a learning image used in an image search learning process, by conducting the image search using the search query; and displaying the plurality of search image regions and the plurality of learning image regions on a display.
12. A computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable medium comprising programmed instructions, the instructions causing the computer to execute: retrieving a plurality of search image regions from a particular image by conducting an image search using a search query; extracting a plurality of learning image regions from a learning image used in an image search learning process, by conducting the image search using the search query; and displaying the plurality of search image regions and the plurality of learning image regions on a display.
