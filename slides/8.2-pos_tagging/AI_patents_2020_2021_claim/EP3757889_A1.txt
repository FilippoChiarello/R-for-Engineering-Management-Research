<title>
AUTOMATIC ELIMINATION OF NOISE FOR BIG DATA ANALYTICS
</title>

<abstract>
A method comprising identifying a set of target features for a plurality of data instances of an input data collection; determining feature values for the set of target features for the plurality of data instances; identifying a plurality of outlier data instances based on the determined feature values; identifying a plurality of noisy data instances from the outlier data instances based on feature values of the plurality of noisy data instances, wherein a noisy data instance is identified based on a determination that noise is present in noisy data instance; and providing an indication of the plurality of noisy data instances.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising: identifying a set of target features for a plurality of data instances of an input data collection; determining feature values for the set of target features for the plurality of data instances; identifying a plurality of outlier data instances based on the determined feature values; identifying a plurality of noisy data instances from the outlier data instances based on feature values of the plurality of noisy data instances, wherein a noisy data instance is identified based on a determination that noise is present in noisy data instance; and providing an indication of the plurality of noisy data instances.
2. The method of Claim 1, further comprising: determining a class of the input data collection; and selecting the set of target features from a plurality of target features based on the class of the input data collection.
3. The method of Claim 2, wherein the plurality of data instances are images of a processing layer of at least one semiconductor chip of at least one wafer of a process technology and wherein the class of the data instance corresponds to the processing layer and the process technology.
4. The method of any one of Claims 2-3, further comprising determining the class of the input data collection based on feature values determined for the plurality of target features for a subset of the plurality of data instances of the input data collection.
5. The method of any one of Claims 1-4, wherein identifying the plurality of outlier data instances based on the determined feature values comprises clustering the plurality data instances of the input data collection based on the determined feature values.
6. The method of any one of Claims 1-5, further comprising utilizing a first model to generate a first prediction indicative of whether a first one of the outlier data instances should be classified as a noisy data instance; utilizing a second model to generate a second prediction indicative of whether the first one of the outlier data instances should be classified as a noisy data instance; and determining whether the first one of the outlier data instances is a noisy data instance based on the first prediction and the second prediction.
7. The method of Claim 6, wherein the first model is a random forest model and the second model is a Bayesian optimization model.
8. The method of Claim 7, wherein the Bayesian optimization model is trained with a hierarchical mixture of Gaussian models coupled with Gaussian outlier detection.
9. The method of Claim 7, wherein the random forest model is optimized using a multi-modal asynchronous genetic algorithm.
10. The method of any one of Claims 1-9, wherein the set of target features comprises one or more of alignment distance, alignment quality, a Laplacian of Gaussian-based blob measure, image entropy, merged contours, broken contours, unexpected contours, contour width distribution, contour height distribution, contour area distribution, local or global image intensity histogram, local or global image contrast variation, line-edge roughness, and line-width roughness.
11. An apparatus comprising means for performing the method of any of Claims 1-10.
12. A computer readable medium including instructions, when executed, to perform the method of any of Claims 1-10.
13. An apparatus comprising logic, at least a portion of which is in hardware logic, the logic to perform the method of any of Claims 1-10.
