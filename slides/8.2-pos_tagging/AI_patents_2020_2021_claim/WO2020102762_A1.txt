<title>
OPTICAL SYSTEM DESIGN
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, apparatus and systems for achieving efficient optical design are described. In one representative aspect, a method for assisting optical design includes obtaining a training set of optical systems, wherein the optical systems in the training set are spread across a design space defined by one or more design parameters, and clustered near desirable regions; establishing, using the training set, a correspondence between a performance value of an optical system and one or more design parameters in the design space; and providing, based on the correspondence, a performance evaluation of a corresponding optical system given a set of input design parameters.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A method for assisting optical system design, comprising:
obtaining a training set of optical systems, wherein the optical systems in the training set are spread across a design space defined by one or more design parameters, and clustered near desirable regions;
establishing, using the training set, a correspondence between a performance value of an optical system and one or more design parameters in the design space; and
providing, based on the correspondence, a performance evaluation of a corresponding optical system given a set of input design parameters.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the correspondence is established by training a neural network using the training set.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the performance evaluation is provided by generating a real-time visualization of the performance value corresponding to the set of input design parameters.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the real-time visualization comprises one or more images representing multiple performance outputs that correspond to the set of input design parameters.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the real-time visualization comprises a twodimensional representation or a three-dimensional representation of the performance evaluation.
6. The method of any one or more of claims 1 to 5, comprising:
displaying the corresponding optical system given the set of input design parameters.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the set of input design parameters is determined based on a set of geometrical primitives or a set of constraints.
8. The method of claim 6 or 7, comprising:
generating, in real-time, an updated optical system according to a change of at least one parameter in the set of input design parameters based on the correspondence.
9. The method of any one or more of claims 1 to 8, comprising:
updating the optical system iteratively based on the correspondence.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the optical system is updated iteratively based on inputs from a user.
11. A device for assisting optical system design, comprising:
one or more processors; and
a memory including processor-executable instructions stored thereon, the processorexecutable instructions upon execution by the one or more processors configures the one or more processors to:
obtain a training set of optical systems, wherein the optical systems in the training set are spread across a design space defined by one or more design parameters, and clustered near desirable regions;
establish, using the training set, a correspondence between a performance value of an optical system and one or more design parameters in the design space; and
provide, based on the correspondence, a performance evaluation of a corresponding optical system given a set of input design parameters.
12. The device of claim 11, wherein the correspondence is established by training a neural network using the training set.
13. The device of claim 11 or 12, wherein the performance evaluation is provided by generating a real-time visualization of the performance value corresponding to the set of input design parameters.

update the optical system iteratively based on the correspondence.
20. The device of claim 19, wherein the optical system is updated iteratively based on inputs from a user.
21. A non-transitory computer readable medium having code stored thereon, wherein the code, when executed by a processor, causes the processor to implement a method that comprises:
obtaining a training set of optical systems, wherein the optical systems in the training set are spread across a design space defined by one or more design parameters, and clustered near desirable regions;
establishing, using the training set, a correspondence between a performance value of an optical system and one or more design parameters in the design space; and
