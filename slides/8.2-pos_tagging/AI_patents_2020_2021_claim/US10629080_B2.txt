<title>
Autonomous vehicles featuring vehicle intention system
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides autonomous vehicles that include a vehicle intention system that provides intention signals indicative of an intention of the autonomous vehicle. In particular, in one example, the vehicle intention system can obtain one or more operational messages from various systems or components of an autonomous vehicle that operate to control the autonomous vehicle. The operational messages can include operational data regarding the control or operation of the autonomous vehicle. The vehicle intention system can determine an intention of the autonomous vehicle based at least in part on the one or more operational messages. The vehicle intention system can output one or more intention signals that indicate the determined intention of the autonomous vehicle. For example, the vehicle intention system can publish intention messages that indicate the determined intention to one or more components or systems that consume the intention messages.
