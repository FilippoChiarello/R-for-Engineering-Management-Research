<title>
METROLOGY METHOD AND METHOD FOR TRAINING A DATA STRUCTURE FOR USE IN METROLOGY
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a method of determining a complex-valued field relating to a structure, comprising: obtaining image data relating to a series of images of the structure, for which at least one measurement parameter is varied over the series and obtaining a trained network operable to map a series of images to a corresponding complex-valued field. The method comprises inputting the image data into said trained network and non-iteratively determining the complex-valued field relating to the structure as the output of the trained network. A method of training the trained network is also disclosed.

<claims>
1. A method of determining a complex-valued field relating to a structure, comprising: obtaining image data relating to a series of images of the structure, for which at least one measurement parameter is varied over the series; obtaining a trained network operable to map a series of images to a corresponding complex-valued field; inputting said image data into said trained network; and non-iteratively determining the complex-valued field relating to the structure as the output of the trained network.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the image data has been obtained from a unreferenced optical measurement.
3. A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the unreferenced optical measurement was performed using a holographic apparatus for which a reference branch was disabled.
4. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, comprising performing one or more optical measurements to obtain said image data.
5. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the trained network is a neural network or an auto-encoder/decoder network.
6. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the trained network has been trained on training data relating to a series of holographic measurements of one or more training structures, for which at the least one measurement parameter is varied over the series.
7. A method as claimed in claim 6, wherein an apparatus used to obtain the image data and the an apparatus used to obtain the training data is a similar or the same holographic apparatus, comprising a reference branch for providing reference radiation; and wherein: said image data is obtained from unreferenced optical measurements performed with the reference branch disabled, and said training data is obtained from referenced optical measurements performed with the reference branch enabled.
8. A method as claimed in claim 6 or 7, comprising a training step to train an untrained network to obtain the trained network, the training step comprising: extracting sideband data and central band data from said training data; determining complex-valued field data from said sideband data; and using central band data and corresponding complex-valued field data to train the untrained network to directly map the central band data to the complex-valued field, and wherein, optionally, said training step comprises an initial correction for optical aberration in the training data or sideband data prior to said step of determining the complex-valued field.
9. A method as claimed in any of claims 6 to 8, wherein said training data exclusively or partially comprises simulated holographic measurements.
10. A method as claimed in any of claims 6 to 10, comprising the step of performing and/or simulating the holographic measurements to obtain said training data.
11. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the at least one measurement parameter comprises focus.
12. A method of training an untrained network to obtain a trained network being operable to map a series of images to a corresponding complex-valued field, the training step comprising: obtaining training data relating to a series of holographic measurements of one or more training structures, for which at the least one measurement parameter is varied over the series; extracting sideband data and central band data from said training data; determining complex-valued field data from said sideband data; and using the central band data and corresponding complex-valued field data to train the untrained network to directly map the central band data to the complex-valued field.
13. A method as claimed in claim 12, wherein said training data exclusively or partially comprises simulated holographic measurements.
14. A method as claimed in claim 12 or 13, comprising the step of performing and/or simulating the holographic measurements to obtain said training data.
15. A metrology apparatus configured to determine a characteristic of a structure manufactured on a substrate, comprising: a data structure comprising a trained network operable to directly map a series of images to a corresponding complex-valued field; and a processor operable to use said data structure to determine a complex-valued field relating to the structure from image data comprising a series of images of the structure, for which at least one measurement parameter is varied over the series, and wherein, optionally, the metrology apparatus is operable to perform the method of any of claims 1 to 14.
