<title>
Early-Warning Fire Detection System Based on a Multivariable Approach
</title>

<abstract>
An automated fire detection system includes a distributed network of standalone sensor units having mulifunctional capability to detect wildfires at their earliest stage. Multiple modes of verification are employed, including thermal imaging, spectral analysis, near infrared and long-wave infrared measurements, measurements of the presence and/or concentration of smoke, and sensing local temperature and humidity and wind speed and direction. A dedicated algorithm receives all data from the network and determines the location of flames from the imaging sensors, combined with the smoke, temperature, humidity, and wind measurements at every dispersed device.
