SYSTEMS, ENVIRONMENT AND METHODS FOR IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS OF RECURRING TRANSITORY PHYSIOLOGICAL STATES AND EVENTS USING A PORTABLE DATA COLLECTION DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
In one aspect, the systems, environment, and methods described herein support anticipation and identification of adverse health events and/or atypical behavioral episodes such as Autistic behaviors, epileptic seizures, heart attack, stroke, and/or narcoleptic "sleep attacks" using a portable data collection device. In another aspect, the systems, environment, and methods described herein support measurement of motions and vibrations associated with recurring transitory physiological states and events using a portable data collection device. For example, motion and vibration measurements may be analyzed to identify pronounced head motion patterns indicative of specific heart defects, neurodegenerative conditions, inner ear or other balance problems, or types of cardiac disease. In another example, motion and vibration measurements may be analyzed to identify slow-wave changes indicative of temporary conditions such as intoxication, fatigue, distress, aggression, attention deficit, anger, and/or narcotic ingestion as well as temporary or periodic normal events, such as ovulation, pregnancy, and sexual arousal.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: a wearable data collection device designed to be worn upon a head of a wearer, the wearable data collection device comprising processing circuitry, and a non-transitory computer readable medium having instructions stored thereon, and one or more input capture elements connected to and/or in communication with the wearable data collection device, wherein the one or more input capture elements are positioned upon or proximate to the head of the wearer; wherein the instructions, when executed by the processing circuitry, cause the processing circuitry to: collect, over a period of time via at least one of the one or more input capture elements, sensor data, wherein the sensor data includes at least one of image data, audio data, electromagnetic data, and motion data, analyze the sensor data to identify a time progression of measurements including at least one of a) a plurality of small motion measurements, and b) a plurality of vibration measurements, analyze the time progression of measurements to identify a physiological pattern, wherein the physiological pattern comprises at least one of a pronounced head motion pattern and a slow-wave change pattern, store, upon a non-transitory computer readable storage device, the physiological pattern, and provide, to at least one of a wearer of the wearable data collection device and a third party computing device, feedback corresponding to the physiological pattern, wherein providing feedback to the wearer comprises providing, via at least one output feature of one or more output features of the wearable data collection device responsive to a physiological state indicated by the physiological pattern, at least one of visual, audible, haptic, and neural stimulation feedback to the wearer, and providing feedback to the third party computing device comprises transmitting, via a wired or wireless transmission link, a data transmission to the third party computing device identifying at least one of the physiological pattern and the identification of the physiological state.
