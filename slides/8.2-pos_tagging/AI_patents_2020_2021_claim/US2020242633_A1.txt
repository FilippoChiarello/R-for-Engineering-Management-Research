AUTOMATED METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR ENRICHING A COMPANY PROFILE WITH A COMPANY LOGO BY EXTRACTING CANDIDATE IMAGES FROM VARIOUS SOURCES AND DETERMINING WHICH IMAGE MOST CLOSELY CORRESPONDS THE COMPANY LOGO
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems are provided for automatically enriching a company profile with a company logo by extracting candidate images from various sources and determining which image most closely corresponds the company logo. A company logo module can search different web-based sources for different images that are candidate logos for the particular company; determine which image most closely corresponds to a company logo for the particular company; select the image that most closely corresponds to the company logo as the company logo to be included in the company profile for the particular company, and add the selected image to the company profile for the particular company to enrich it.
