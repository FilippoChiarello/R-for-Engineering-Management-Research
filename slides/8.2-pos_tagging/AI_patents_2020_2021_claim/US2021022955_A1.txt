INTELLIGENCE ENGINE SYSTEM AND METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A percussive therapy system that includes a percussive massage device including a network interface, and an intelligence engine. The intelligence engine is configured to receive manual capture data and real-time tracking data from the percussive massage device, receive remote data from a remote data source, and generate recommendation data comprising a recommended protocol to be performed by the percussive massage device. The recommendation data is generated from demographic, activity, temporal, analytics, and biometric data, received from the manual capture data, the real-time tracking data, and the remote data inputs.

<claims>
1. A percussive therapy system comprising: a percussive massage device comprising a network interface, an intelligence engine configured to receive manual capture data and real-time tracking data from the percussive massage device, receive remote data from at least one remote data source, and generate recommendation data comprising a recommended protocol to be performed by the percussive massage device, wherein the recommendation data is generated from at least one of demographic data, activity data comprising prior use of the percussive massage device, temporal data comprising timing of use of the percussive massage device, analytics data corresponding to use of the percussive massage device, and biometric data, received from the manual capture data, the real-time tracking data, and the remote data inputs.
2. The percussive therapy system of claim 1 wherein the recommendation data is provided to the percussive massage device.
3. The percussive therapy system of claim 1 wherein the recommendation data is generated based at least in part on aggregated data from at least one of the manual capture data, the real-time tracking data, and the remote data inputs.
4. The percussive therapy system of claim 1 wherein the recommended protocol comprises at least one step of a recommended routine.
5. The percussive therapy system of claim 1 wherein the recommended protocol is modified based on at least one of the manual capture data, the real-time tracking data, and the remote data inputs.
6. The percussive therapy system of claim 1 wherein the recommendation data comprises at least one of a behavior modification recommendation and a wellness insight.
7. The percussive therapy system of claim 1 wherein the recommendation data comprises a user notification of at least one of the recommended protocol, a change to the recommended protocol, and a behavior recommendation.
8. The percussive therapy system of claim 1 wherein the demographic data comprises at least one of a biological parameter of a user, an age of the user, a height of the user, and a weight of the user.
9. The percussive therapy system of claim 1 wherein the activity data comprises at least one of a type of exercise activity, a volume of the exercise activity, an intensity of the exercise activity, and a trend in activity parameters over time.
10. The percussive therapy system of claim 1 wherein the temporal data comprises at least one of an absolute time of an exercise routine of a user and a relative time of the exercise routine to a predetermined event.
11. The percussive therapy system of claim 1 wherein the analytics data comprises at least one of a duration of use, a frequency of use, a force of use, and an attachment use of the percussive massage device.
12. The percussive therapy system of claim 1 wherein the biometric data comprises at least one of a heart rate of a user, a heart rate variation of the user, sleep metrics of the user, a temperature of the user, and imaging data comprising at least one of a thermographic image of a user, an ultrasound of the user, and an x-ray image of the user.
13. The percussive therapy system of claim 1 wherein the recommendation data is generated from a weighted scoring determination comprising at least one of a recovery determination score, a wellness determination score, and a behavior determination score.
14. A method of providing therapeutic effect using a percussive massage device, the method comprising the steps of: receiving manual capture data and real-time tracking data of the percussive massage device, receiving remote data inputs from at least one remote data source, aggregating the manual capture data, the real-time tracking data, and the remote data inputs, each comprising at least one of demographic data, activity data comprising prior use of the percussive massage device, temporal data comprising timing of use of the percussive massage device, analytics data corresponding to use of the percussive massage device, and biometric data, and generating recommendation data from the aggregated data comprising a recommended protocol to be performed by the percussive massage device.
15. The method of claim 14 further comprising modifying the recommended protocol based on at least one of the manual capture data, the real-time tracking data, and the remote data inputs.
16. The method of claim 14 further comprising generating a weighted scoring determination comprising at least one of a recovery determination score, a wellness determination score, and a behavior determination score.
17. The method of claim 14 further comprising providing the recommendation data to the percussive massage device.
