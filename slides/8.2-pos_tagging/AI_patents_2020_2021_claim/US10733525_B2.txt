<title>
Technical performance data trained learning system
</title>

<abstract>
Various embodiments are described that relate to an adaptive learning system. The adaptive learning system can be trained by correlation between a first set of raw technical performance data and a set of actual operational effectiveness assessment data. Once trained, the adaptive learning system can be deployed. Once deployed, the adaptive learning system can produce a set of predicted operational effectiveness assessment data from a second set of raw technical performance data that is different from the first set of raw technical performance data.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method, comprising: accessing a set of raw technical performance data; accessing a set of actual operational effectiveness data; training an adaptive learning system based on a relationship between at least part of the set of raw technical performance data and the set of actual operational effectiveness data; deploying the adaptive learning system once trained; further training the adaptive learning system while the adaptive learning system is deployed; collecting a set of actual technical performance data; and making an actual operation effectiveness prediction through use of the set of actual technical performance data by way of the adaptive learning system while the adaptive learning system is deployed, where the adaptive learning system is a deep learning system that employs at least five layers, where the set of raw technical performance data is from an initial duration of a test and evaluation event, where the set of actual technical performance data is from a remaining duration of the test and evaluation event, where the adaptive learning system, when online, is configured to predict a set of predicted operational assessment data based, at least in part, on the set of raw technical performance data and where the adaptive learning system trained while the adaptive learning system is online.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, comprising: validating the adaptive learning system after the adaptive learning system is trained; and deploying the adaptive learning system after validation of the adaptive learning system.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, comprising: dividing the set of raw technical performance data into a first raw part and a second raw part, where training the adaptive learning system based on the relationship between at least part of the set of raw technical performance data and the set of actual operational effectiveness data comprises training the adaptive learning system based on a relationship between the first raw part and the set of actual operational effectiveness data and where validating the adaptive learning system comprises testing the adaptive learning system through observation of a predicted operation effectiveness by use of the second raw part.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, where the set of raw technical performance data is human produced.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, where the set of actual operational effectiveness data is produced from mathematical calculation.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, where the set of actual operational effectiveness data is derived, at least in part, from the set of raw technical performance data.
