MEDICAL PROCESSING APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
According to one embodiment, a medical processing apparatus includes a processor. The processor obtains projection data representing an intensity of an X-ray flux detected at a plurality of detector elements. The processor generates, based on the projection data, (i) a plurality of first projection images corresponding to a first material component and a plurality of energies and (ii) a plurality of second projection images corresponding to a second material component and a plurality of energies. The processor estimates an X-ray scatter flux included in the X-ray flux based on the first projection images and the second projection images. The processor corrects the projection data based on the estimated X-ray scatter flux.
