METHOD FOR ASSISTING CORNEAL SEVERITY IDENTIFICATION USING UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
A method for assisting corneal severity identification, the method comprising obtaining a corneal configuration data set of a cornea to be examined by a tomography such as an optical coherence tomography; visualizing the corneal configuration data set of the cornea to be examined along with a number of pre-existing corneal configuration data sets of disorder corneas, disorder-suspect corneas and normal corneas obtained by the tomography using t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding in a two or three dimensional map, and judging corneal severity from the map.
