<title>
SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR REAL TIME SCREEN DISPLAY COORDINATE AND SHAPE DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods, and devices are provided for detecting coordinate information about a screen display shown at a monitor unit. The monitor unit is located within the field of view of a vision-based computing device. A set of source images captured by the camera representative of the screen display shown at the monitor unit are stored. A neural network model is stored in memory. A processor is configured to preprocess the set of source images to obtain an input frame and to process the input frame with the loaded neural network model to predict corner coordinates of the screen display in real-time. In a further feature, the processor may be configured to estimate a pose of the vision-based computing device relative to the monitor unit when a level of confidence in the updated corner coordinates exceeds a threshold.
