<title>
COMPENSATING LASER ALIGNMENT FOR IRREGULARITIES IN AN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING MACHINE POWDERBED
</title>

<abstract>
A system (100) for additive manufacturing machine (100) energy beam alignment error compensation includes, a calibration table (127) having x-y planar offsets to correct (3D) laser alignment errors representing energy beam positional offsets between beam-steering commanded energy beam locations and fiducial marks generated on a burn-paper, a recoater mechanism that distributes successive layers of powder, one or more sensors monitoring the powderbed (130) surface proximal to the beam scan unit (125), and a processor unit (162) configured to perform a method. The method including collecting sensor data representing height variations across at least a portion of the powderbed (130) surface, deriving dimensional data from the collected data, analyzing the dimensional data to determine a distribution of differences between the powderbed (130) surface and a reference plane containing the burn-paper when the fiducial marks were generated, and calculating z-axis calibration offset points for inclusion in the calibration table (127) x-y planar offsets. A method and a non-transitory medium are also disclosed.
