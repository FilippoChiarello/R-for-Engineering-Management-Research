RANDOM ACCESS ENHANCEMENTS FOR URLLC OVER 5G WIRELESS NETWORKS
</title>

<abstract>
A method of randomly accessing wireless communication resources in a LTE uplink comprising transmitting, by a user device, a plurality of random access requests wherein each request is transmitted on a different communication channel from a plurality of communication channels and each request comprises a preamble generated using a different root sequence. The method further comprises receiving, at the user device, at least one random access response via the plurality of communication channels; and completing a random access procedure on the communication channel which conveyed the random access response

<claims>
1. A method of randomly accessing wireless communication resources in a LTE uplink comprising: transmitting, by a user device, a plurality of random access requests wherein: each request is transmitted on a different communication channel from a plurality of communication channels; and each request comprises a preamble generated using a different root sequence; receiving, at the user device, at least one random access response via the plurality of communication channels; and completing a random access procedure on the communication channel which conveyed the random access response.
2. A method according to claim 1 further comprising receiving two or more random access responses and completing the random access procedure on the communication channel which first conveyed the random access response.
3. A method according to claim 2 wherein a base station uses a plurality of component carriers and wherein each communication channel uses a different component carrier from the plurality of component carriers.
4. A method according to claim 2 wherein each communication channel is established with a different base station from a plurality of base stations.
5. A method according to claim 4 wherein the plurality of base stations comprises a plurality of slave base stations communicatively connected to a master base station.
6. A method according to claim 5 further comprising: communicating random access requests received by the plurality of slave base stations to the master base station; determining, at the master base station, the plurality of base stations which received a random access request from a user device; and transmitting a random access response to the user device by a base station from the plurality of base stations which received a random access request.
7. A method according to claim 6 wherein the random access request further comprises an indication of the signal strength and wherein the method further comprises: selecting which base station transmits a random access response based on the indication of signal strength in the plurality of random access requests.
8. A method according to claim 1 wherein the preamble is generated by multiplying a first preamble by a conjugate of a second preamble.
9. A method according to claim 8 wherein the first preamble is based on a first root sequence and the second preamble is based on a cyclic shifted version of the first root sequence.
10. A method according to claim 8 further comprising: decoding the preamble using an augmented table comprising a plurality of root sequences and each possible combination of the plurality of root sequences.
11. A method of operating a user device in an LTE network comprising: transmitting a plurality of random access requests wherein: each request is transmitted on a different communication channel from a plurality of communication channels; and each random access request comprises a preamble generated using a different root sequence; receiving at least one random access response via the plurality of communication channels; and completing a random access procedure on the communication channel which conveyed the random access response.
12. A method according to claim 11 further comprising receiving two or more random access responses and completing the random access procedure on the communication channel which first conveyed the random access response.
13. A method according to claim 12 wherein each communication channel uses a different component carrier of a base station.
14. A method according to claim 12 wherein each communication channel is established with a different base station from a plurality of base stations
15. A method according to claim 12 wherein the random access request further comprises an indication of the base stations signal strength
16. A method according to claim 11 wherein the preamble is generated by multiplying a first preamble based on a first root sequence by a conjugate of a second preamble based on a cyclic shifted version of the first root sequence.
17. A method of operating a base station in a LTE network comprising a plurality of base stations wherein the base station is operable in a master configuration and a slave configuration, the method comprising: receiving a random access request from a user device; and in the slave configuration: communicating the random access request and an identifier associated with the user device to a master base station; and transmitting a random access response to the user device when instructed by the master base station; in the master configuration: determining a number of base stations which received a random access request from the user device; determining, a base station from the number of base stations to transmit a random access response; instructing a base station from the number of base to transmit a random access response to the user device.
18. A method according to claim 17 wherein the random access request comprises an indication of signal strength and determining a base station from the number of base stations is based on the indication of signal strength in the random access requests.
19. A method according to claim 18 wherein the plurality of base stations are communicatively connected to each other by an X2 interface.
20. A method according to claim 17 wherein the random access request comprises a preamble and the method further comprises: decoding a preamble using an augmented table comprising a plurality of root sequences and each possible combination of the plurality of root sequences.
