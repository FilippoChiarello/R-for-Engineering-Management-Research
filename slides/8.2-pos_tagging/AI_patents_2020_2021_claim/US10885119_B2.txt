Method and system for processing multimodal user queries
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein is method and system for processing multimodal user queries. The method comprises determining availability of one or more responses to each of one or more sub-queries, wherein the one or more sub-queries are formed by splitting the multimodal user queries. The method detects requirement of an expert to provide the one or more responses upon determining at least one of unavailability of the one or more responses by the response generation system or based predefined conditions. Thereafter, a summarized content is generated by summarizing context of the one or more sub-queries and historical conversation data associated with the one or more sub-queries. Based on the summarized content, the one or more sub-queries are reformulated. Finally, the one or more responses received, from the expert, for the reformulated one or more sub-queries are collated provided as the one or more responses for the multimodal user queries.

<claims>
I claim:
1. A method of processing multimodal user queries, the method comprising: splitting, by a response generation system, the multimodal user queries into a plurality of sub-queries by identifying one or more distinct contexts in the multimodal user queries, wherein the multimodal user queries is obtained by merging relevant information of user queries in one or more inputs formats comprising text, audio and gesture; determining, by the response generation system, availability of one or more responses in a database, to each of the plurality of sub-queries based on domain-specific keywords in the plurality of sub-queries, determining, by the response generation system, that context of a first sub-query and a second sub-query in the plurality of sub-queries is inter-dependent with respect to each other such that a response to first sub-query serves as an input to the second sub-query; detecting, by the response generation system, requirement of an expert to provide the one or more responses to the second sub-query upon determining unavailability of the one or more responses to the second sub-query in the database; generating, by the response generation system, a summarized content by summarizing context of: the first sub-query and the second sub-query that have inter-dependent context, and response of the first sub-query, and historical conversation data specific to the user associated with the one or more sub-queries, using one or more Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, wherein the historical conversation data comprises: data related to previous conversations of the user with the response generation system for previous multimodal user queries and background information of the user; reformulating, by the response generation system, the second sub-query based on the summarized content; collating, by the response generation system, the one or more responses received, from the expert, for the reformulated second sub-query; and querying, by the response generation system, the user for receiving additional information upon identifying insufficiency in the reformulated second sub-query for providing the one or more responses to the second sub-query.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1 further comprises providing, by the response generation system, the one or more responses to the plurality of sub-queries upon detecting the availability of the one or more responses for the plurality of sub-queries.
3. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein determining the availability of the one or more responses to the plurality of sub-queries comprises: creating, dynamically, by the response generation system, an input frame comprising one or more input slots, wherein a count of the one or more input slots created depends on a count of the plurality of sub-queries; and detecting, by the response generation system, the availability of the one or more responses to the plurality of sub-queries when each of the one or more input slots are occupied with respective one of the one or more responses and when weighted sum of each of the one or more responses exceed a predefined threshold value.
4. The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein detecting requirement of the expert to provide the one or more responses to the second sub-query upon determining a first pre-defined condition, wherein the first pre-defined condition comprises: detection of an ambiguity in the second sub-query based on a vacancy in the one or more input slots.
5. The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the weighted sum is obtained based on a second pre-defined condition comprising a degree of matching a keyword in each of the plurality of sub-queries with the one or more responses provided by the response generation system, a confidence level in each of the one or more responses, or a count of responses provided by the response generation system.
6. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein collating each of the one or more responses comprises: creating, dynamically, by the response generation system, an output frame comprising one or more output slots, wherein a count of the one or more output slots created depends on a count of the reformulated second sub-query; detecting, by the response generation system, an availability of the one or more responses for the reformulated second sub-query, from the expert, when each of the one or more output slots are occupied with one of the one or more responses; and collating, by the response generation system, each of the one or more responses upon detecting the availability of the one or more responses for the reformulated second sub-query.
7. The method as claimed in claim 6 further comprises detecting, by the response generation system, unavailability of the one or more responses to the second sub-query, from the expert, for the reformulated second sub-query when the one or more output slots are unoccupied with the one of the one or more responses to the second sub-query.
8. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the collating each of the one or more responses comprises removing duplicate sentences in each of the one or more responses.
9. A response generation system for processing multimodal user queries, the system comprising: a processor; and a memory, communicatively coupled to the processor, wherein the memory stores processor-executable instructions, which, on execution, causes the processor to: split the multimodal user queries into a plurality of sub-queries by identifying one or more distinct contexts in the multimodal user queries, wherein the multimodal user queries are obtained by merging relevant information of user queries in one or more inputs formats comprising text, audio and gesture; determine availability of one or more responses in a database, to each of the plurality of sub-queries based on domain-specific keywords in the plurality of sub-queries, determining that context of a first sub-query and a second sub-query in the plurality of sub-queries is inter-dependent with respect to each other such that a response to first sub-query serves as an input to the second sub-query; detect requirement of an expert to generate the one or more responses to the second sub-query upon determining unavailability of the one or more responses to the second sub-query in the database; generate a summarized content by summarizing context of: the first sub-query and the second sub-query that have inter-dependent context, and response of the first sub-query, and historical conversation data specific to the user associated with the one or more sub-queries, using one or more Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, wherein the historical conversation data comprises: data related to previous conversations of the user with the response generation system for previous multimodal user queries and background information of the user; reformulate the second sub-query based on the summarized content; collate the one or more responses received, from the expert, for the reformulated second sub-query; and query the user for receiving additional information upon identifying insufficiency in the reformulated second sub-query for providing the one or more responses to the second sub-query.
