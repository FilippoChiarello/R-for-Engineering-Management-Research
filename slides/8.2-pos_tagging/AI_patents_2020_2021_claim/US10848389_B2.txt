<title>
Auto-prioritization of device traffic across local network
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for prioritizing network traffic. In one aspect, a method includes collecting, for local networks, traffic data representing communication traffic over the local network for a period of time; determining, for each of the network devices included in the networks, a device type of the network device and at least one device priority value for the network device; training a device prioritization model, using the traffic data and the device priority values of the devices, receiving, by the device prioritization model, for a local network, a list of network devices that are included in the local network; and generating, by the device prioritization model, a prioritization scheme for the local network that prioritizes device traffic among the network devices based on the device types and device priority values of the network devices.
