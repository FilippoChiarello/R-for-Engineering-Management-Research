Sentiment analysis in a video conference
</title>

<abstract>
In an approach, a computer determines based, at least in part, on a video of an attendee of a video conference, a first sentiment of the attendee wherein the first sentiment includes at least a sentiment from a sentiment analysis of one or more facial expressions of the attendee and a sentiment from a sentiment analysis of a plurality of the attendee's spoken words. The approach includes a computer receiving an indication of an attendee activity in at least a first application in computing devices accessed by the attendee and determining whether the first sentiment of the attendee is related to the video conference based, in part, on the attendee activity in at least the first application. Responsive to determining that the first sentiment of the attendee is not related to the video conference, the computer discards the first sentiment that is unrelated to the video conference.
