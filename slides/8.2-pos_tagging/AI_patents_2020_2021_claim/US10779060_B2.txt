Prediction model training via live stream concept association
</title>

<abstract>
In certain embodiments, training of a neural network or other prediction model may be facilitated via live stream concept association. In some embodiments, a live video stream may be loaded on a user interface for presentation to a user. A user selection related to a frame of the live video stream may be received via the user interface during the presentation of the live video stream on the user interface, where the user selection indicates a presence of a concept in the frame of the live video stream. In response to the user selection related to the frame, an association of at least a portion of the frame of the live video stream and the concept may be generated, and the neural network or other prediction model may be trained based on the association of at least the portion of the frame with the concept.
