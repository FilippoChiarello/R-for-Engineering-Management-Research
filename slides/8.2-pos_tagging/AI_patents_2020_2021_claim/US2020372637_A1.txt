SYSTEM METHOD AND COMPUTER-ACCESSIBLE MEDIUM FOR CLASSIFYING TISSUE USING AT LEAST ONE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
An exemplary system, method and computer-accessible medium for classifying a tissue(s) of a patient(s) can include, for example, receiving an image(s) of an internal portion(s) of a breast of the patient(s), and automatically classifying the tissue(s) of the breast by applying a neural(s) network to the image(s). The tissue(s) can include a lymph node(s). The lymph node(s) can be classified as a cancerous tissue or a non-cancerous tissue. The tissue(s) can be classified as a fibroglandular tissue or a background parenchymal enhancement tissue. The tissue(s) can be classified as a cancer molecular subtype. The image(s) can be is a magnetic resonance image.

<claims>
1. A non-transitory computer-accessible medium having stored thereon computer-executable instructions for classifying at least one tissue of at least one patient, wherein, when a computer arrangement executes the instructions, the computer arrangement is configured to perform procedures comprising: receiving at least one image of at least one internal portion of a breast of the at least one patient; and automatically classifying the at least one tissue of the breast by applying at least one neural network to the at least one image.
2. The computer-accessible medium of claim 1, wherein the at least one tissue includes at least one lymph node.
3. The computer-accessible medium of claim 2, wherein the computer arrangement is further configured to automatically classify the at least one lymph node as a cancerous tissue or a non-cancerous tissue.
4. The computer-accessible medium of claim 1, wherein the computer arrangement is further configured to automatically classify the at least one tissue as a fibroglandular tissue or a background parenchymal enhancement tissue.
5. The computer-accessible medium of claim 1, wherein the computer arrangement is further configured to automatically classify the at least one tissue as a cancer molecular subtype.
6. The computer-accessible medium of claim 1, wherein the at least one image is a magnetic resonance image.
7. The computer-accessible medium of claim 1, wherein the at least one neural network is a convolutional neural network (CNN).
8. The computer-accessible medium of claim 7, wherein the CNN includes a plurality of layers.
9. The computer-accessible medium of claim 8, wherein the layers include (i) a plurality of convolutional layers, (ii) a plurality of rectified linear unit layers, and (iii) a plurality of fully connected layers.
10. The computer-accessible medium of claim 9, wherein at least one of the fully connected layers includes 512 neurons.
11. The computer-accessible medium of claim 8, wherein the layers include (i) a plurality of convolutional layers, (ii) a plurality of residual layers, and (iii) a plurality of linear layers.
12. The computer-accessible medium of claim 7, wherein the CNN includes a collapsing and expanding CNN.
13. The computer-accessible medium of claim 12, wherein (i) an expanding arm of the collapsing and expanding CNN includes a plurality of convolutional filters and a plurality of strided convolutions, and (ii) a collapsing arm of the collapsing and expanding CNN includes a plurality of convolutional transpose filters.
14. The computer-accessible medium of claim 1, wherein the computer arrangement is further configured to determine at least one score based on the at least one image using the at least one neural network.
15. The computer-accessible medium of claim 14, wherein the computer arrangement is further configured to automatically classify the tissue based on the at least one score.
16. The computer-accessible medium of claim 15, wherein the computer arrangement is configured to automatically classify the tissue based on the score being above 0.5.
17. The computer-accessible medium of claim 1, wherein the computer arrangement is further configured to normalize intensity values in the at least one image.
18. The computer-accessible medium of claim 17, wherein the computer arrangement is configured to normalize the intensity values using at least one z score map.
19. A method for classifying at least one tissue of at least one patient, comprising: receiving at least one image of at least one internal portion of a breast of the at least one patient; and using a computer hardware arrangement, automatically classifying the at least one tissue of the breast by applying at least one neural network to the at least one image.
20. 20-36. (canceled)
37. A system for classifying at least one tissue of at least one patient, comprising: a computer hardware arrangement configured to: receive at least one image of at least one internal portion of a breast of the at least one patient; and automatically classify the at least one tissue of the breast by applying at least one neural network to the at least one image.
