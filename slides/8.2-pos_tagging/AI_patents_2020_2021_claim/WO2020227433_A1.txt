</title>

<abstract>
Various embodiments provide novel tools and techniques for behind-the-ear biosignal sensing and stimulation. A system includes a behind-the-ear wearable device further including an ear piece, one or more sensors coupled to a patient behind the ears of the patient and a host machine coupled to the behind-the-ear wearable device. The host machine includes a second processor; and a second computer readable medium in communication with the second processor, the second computer readable medium having encoded thereon a second set of instructions executable by the second processor to obtain the first signal, separate the first signal into one or more individual biosignals, and determine, based on one or more features extracted from the one or more individual biosignals, a wakefulness classification of the patient.
