Real-time video triggering for traffic surveillance and photo enforcement applications using near infrared video acquisition
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for real-time video triggering for traffic surveillance and photo enforcement comprises receiving a streaming video feed and performing a spatial uniformity correction on each frame of the streaming video feed and resampling the video feed to a lower spatial resolution. Motion blobs are then detected. Next a three-layered approach is used to identify candidate motion blobs which can be output to a triggering module to trigger a video collection action.
