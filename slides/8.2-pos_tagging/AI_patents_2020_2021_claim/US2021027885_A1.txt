METHOD OF FACILITATING IMAGING STUDY INTERPRETATIONS BETWEEN HEALTHCARE FACILITIES AND PHYSICIANS INCLUDING CUSTOMIZATION OF IMAGING STUDIES
</title>

<abstract>
A method for allowing customization of an imaging study presented to qualified physicians to allow the qualified physicians to provide interpretations of the customized imaging study. The method includes receiving, from a healthcare facility, an imaging study and a request for interpretation of the imaging study, the request including physician selection criteria; determining identities of qualified physicians by matching physician credentials to the physician selection criteria; customizing the imaging study in accordance with preferences of the qualified physicians; providing, to the qualified physicians, the request for interpretation and access to the imaging study and the customized imaging study; and receiving an interpretation of at least one of the imaging study and the customized imaging study from those qualified physicians that have accepted the request for interpretation.

<claims>
1. A method for allowing customization of an imaging study presented to qualified physicians to allow the qualified physicians to provide interpretations of the customized imaging study, the method comprising: receiving, from a healthcare facility, an imaging study and a request for interpretation of the imaging study, the request including physician selection criteria; determining identities of qualified physicians by matching physician credentials to the physician selection criteria; customizing the imaging study in accordance with preferences of the qualified physicians; providing, to the qualified physicians, the request for interpretation and access to the imaging study and the customized imaging study; and receiving an interpretation of at least one of the imaging study and the customized imaging study from those qualified physicians that have accepted the request for interpretation.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising recording the request for interpretation in a blockchain database.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the customization of the imaging study includes using at least one of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein preference of the qualified physicians include at least one of body part included in the imaging study, patient demographics, type of scanning equipment used, type of technology used in the scan, manufacturer of the scanning equipment and scanning protocol used.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the physician selection criteria includes at least one of a state the physician is licensed in, an insurance company used by physician, modality of the physician's report, physician rating, and price for the physician's services.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein upon acceptance of the request for interpretation from qualified physicians, making the request inaccessible to other physicians.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the request for interpretation comprises interpretation requirements, the interpretation requirements including at least one of a draft interpretation, a preliminary interpretation, a final interpretation, and a multiple-reading requirement.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving, from the healthcare facility, an approval of the selected imaging study interpretation; deducting fees from an electronic wallet of the healthcare facility; and depositing fees into an electronic wallet of the qualified physician whose imaging study interpretation was approved by the healthcare facility.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising receiving from at least one of the healthcare facility and the physician that supplied the selected imaging study interpretation, a dispute resolution request to be performed by an independent dispute resolution panel.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein a blockchain contract governs the dispute resolution.
11. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving, from the healthcare facility, a request that information related to the imaging study is stored in a blockchain database, the information including at least one of the imaging study, the imaging study interpretation and annotations to the imaging study interpretation; providing third party access to the stored information; and upon a third party accessing the stored information, receiving electronic payment from the third party and distributing at least a portion of the received electronic payment into respective blockchain wallets of the healthcare facility and the physician that supplied the accessed imaging study interpretation.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving electronic payment from the healthcare facility via a blockchain transaction for each request for interpretation of the imaging study.
13. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving electronic payment from the qualified physician that provided the interpretation of the imaging study via a blockchain transaction for each imaging study interpretation.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein a blockchain contract governs all electronic payments concerning the imaging study and the imaging study interpretation.
15. The method of claim 1, further providing incentives for the healthcare facility to provide requests for interpretation and for the physicians to submit imaging study interpretations.
16. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored therein instructions which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform operations comprising: record in a blockchain database an imaging study received from a healthcare facility and a request for interpretation of the imaging study received from the healthcare facility; determine identities of qualified physicians by matching physician credentials to physician selection criteria; customize the imaging study in accordance with preferences of the qualified physicians; provide to the qualified physicians the request for interpretation of the imaging study, and access to the imaging study and the customized imaging study; receive an interpretation of at least one of the imaging study and the customized imaging study from those qualified physicians that have accepted the request for interpretation; select at least one of the imaging study interpretation and the customized imaging study interpretation received from those qualified physicians that have accepted the request for interpretation; and record at least one of the selected imaging study interpretation and the customized imaging study interpretation in the blockchain database.
