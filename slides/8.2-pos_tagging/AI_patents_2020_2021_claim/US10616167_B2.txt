<title>
Enabling wearables to cognitively alter notifications and improve sleep cycles
</title>

<abstract>
A method, computer system, and computer program product for cognitively adjusting a notification alert delivery time are provided. The embodiment may include receiving a message notification from a sender. The embodiment may also include determining an importance of the received message notification based on a plurality of notification attributes and a plurality of person attributes that are each associated with the received message notification. The embodiment may further include, in response to determining to alert a user of the received message notification based on the determined importance, identifying a current user sleep stage. The embodiment may also include, in response to determining the current user sleep stage will minimally impact the user, transmitting the received message notification to a user device.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for cognitively adjusting a notification alert delivery time, the method comprising: receiving a message notification from a sender; determining an importance of the received message notification based on a plurality of notification attributes and a plurality of person attributes that are each associated with the received message notification; in response to determining to alert a user of the received message notification based on the determined importance, identifying a current user sleep stage, wherein the current user sleep stage is REM or NREM, and wherein the NREM sleep stage is selected from a group consisting of N1, N2, and N3; in response to determining the current user sleep stage will not minimally impact the user, tuning one or more wearable technology device parameters for a next sleep stage, wherein tuning the one or more wearable technology device parameters for a next sleep stage further comprises: calculating a minimum amount of time left in a user sleep cycle, wherein the minimum amount of time left in the user sleep cycle is calculated as T=ANTDmin+n+tprev, and wherein T is the time left in the user sleep cycle, ANTDmin is a minimum allowable notification time delay of the current and remaining sleep stages, n is a total amount of time elapsed in the current sleep stage, and tprev is a sum of an elapsed time in each previously completed sleep stage; modifying the notification delivery time based on the calculated minimum amount of time left in the user sleep cycle; and in response to determining the current user sleep stage will minimally impact the user, transmitting the received message notification to a user device.
2. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of notification attributes are selected from a group consisting of a message urgency, one or more participating actors, an event time, a plurality of message text, a conversation history, and the sender.
3. The computer system of claim 1, further comprising: in response to determining to not alert the user based on the determined importance, adjusting the notification delivery time to when the user wakes.
4. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the minimum amount of time left in the user sleep cycle is calculated as a sum of an elapsed time in each previously completed sleep stage, a total amount of time elapsed in the current user sleep stage and a minimum allowable notification time delay of the current user sleep stage and one or more remaining sleep stages in the user sleep cycle.
5. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of person attributes are selected from a group consisting of a sender name, a sender relationship to the user, a time of day, an upcoming calendar schedule, a user sleep stage, a user location, and a sender location.
