<title>
PARTIAL-RESULTS POST-SILICON HARDWARE EXERCISER
</title>

<abstract>
A method for testing an integrated circuit, comprising: accessing a database associated with a test template, wherein said test template is configured to test a selected function of the integrated circuit; storing, in said database, data corresponding to at least partial predicted results of one or more random instruction sequences generated based on said test template; generating, by an automated test generation tool, a random instruction sequence based on said test template; executing said instruction sequence by a hardware exerciser, in the integrated circuit; and comparing results of said instruction sequence with said at least partial predicted results, to verify a function of said integrated circuit.

<claims>
1. A method for testing an integrated circuit, comprising: accessing a database associated with a test template, wherein said test template is configured to test a selected function of the integrated circuit; storing, in said database, data corresponding to at least partial predicted results of one or more random instruction sequences generated based on said test template; generating, by an automated test generation tool, a random instruction sequence based on said test template; executing said instruction sequence by a hardware exerciser, in the integrated circuit; and comparing results of said instruction sequence with said at least partial predicted results, to verify a function of said integrated circuit.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein said at least partial predicted results are related to interrupt instructions.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein said at least partial predicted results are related to load and store instructions.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein said at least partial predicted results are related to and address translations.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein said comparing comprises accessing, by said exerciser, said at least partial predicted results, and wherein said accessing has a constant execution time.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein said integrated circuit is selected from the group consisting of: a microprocessor, a multiprocessor system, a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a bus-bridge, a Digital Signal Processor (DSP), and a direct memory access (DMA) controller.
7. A system for testing an integrated circuit, comprising: at least one hardware processor; and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored thereon program instructions, the program instructions executable by the at least one hardware processor to: access a database associated with a test template, wherein said test template is configured to test a selected function of the integrated circuit, store, in said database, data corresponding to at least partial predicted results of one or more random instruction sequences generated based on said test template, generate, by an automated test generation tool, a random instruction sequence based on said test template, execute said instruction sequence by a hardware exerciser, in the integrated circuit, and compare results of said instruction sequence with said at least partial predicted results, to verify a function of said integrated circuit.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein said at least partial predicted results are related to interrupt instructions.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein said at least partial predicted results are related to load and store instructions.
10. The system of claim 7, wherein said at least partial predicted results are related to and address translations.
11. The system of claim 7, wherein said comparing comprises accessing, by said exerciser, said at least partial predicted results, and wherein said accessing has a constant execution time.
12. The system of claim 7, wherein said integrated circuit is selected from the group consisting of: a microprocessor, a multiprocessor system, a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a bus-bridge, a Digital Signal Processor (DSP), and a direct memory access (DMA) controller.
13. A computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by at least one hardware processor to: access a database associated with a test template, wherein said test template is configured to test a selected function of the integrated circuit; store, in said database, data corresponding to at least partial predicted results of one or more random instruction sequences generated based on said test template; generate, by an automated test generation tool, a random instruction sequence based on said test template; execute said instruction sequence by a hardware exerciser, in the integrated circuit; and compare results of said instruction sequence with said at least partial predicted results, to verify a function of said integrated circuit.
14. The computer program product of claim 13, wherein said at least partial predicted results are related to interrupt instructions.
15. The computer program product of claim 13, wherein said at least partial predicted results are related to load and store instructions.
16. The computer program product of claim 13, wherein said at least partial predicted results are related to and address translations.
17. The computer program product of claim 13, wherein said comparing comprises accessing, by said exerciser, said at least partial predicted results, and wherein said accessing has a constant execution time.
18. The computer program product of claim 13, wherein said integrated circuit is selected from the group consisting of: a microprocessor, a multiprocessor system, a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a bus-bridge, a Digital Signal Processor (DSP), and a direct memory access (DMA) controller.
