Digital content excerpt identification
</title>

<abstract>
Described herein are techniques for identifying and displaying key excerpts of a digital work and related key excerpts of other digital works. Key excerpts are identified by evaluating (a) the number of interactions by human readers within each of the key excerpts and (b) the number of reviews that reference each of the key excerpts. Related excerpts from other books can be identified by comparing the key excerpts of the other books. Excerpts can be displayed by subject, and links are provided to move from one subject to another.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: one or more processors; and one or more non-transitory computer-readable media maintaining instructions executable by the one or more processors to perform acts comprising: obtaining text of a digital work; identifying a first paragraph of text within the digital work, the first paragraph of text including an interaction with a word location by a first human reader, the interaction including one or more of annotating, quoting, sharing, or marking of the first paragraph of text, and wherein the identifying is performed by: locating the interaction based at least in part on metadata associated with the word location, the metadata indicating the one or more of the annotating, the quoting, the sharing, or the marking of the first paragraph of text by the first human reader; and determining, based at least in part on the metadata associated with the word location, that the word location is within a range of word locations associated with the first paragraph of text; generating, based at least in part on a number of human readers that interacted with the word location associated with the first paragraph of text, a first score corresponding to the first paragraph of text; identifying a first review associated with the digital work, the first review created by a second human reader; determining, using one or more words from the first review to search the text of the digital work, that the first review quotes portions of the first paragraph of text; generating, based at least in part on the first review quoting portions of the first paragraph of text and a number of second reviews that quote the first paragraph of text, a second score corresponding to the first paragraph of text; calculating, based at least in part on the first score and the second score, a composite score corresponding to the first paragraph of text; determining, based at least in part on the composite score, a ranking of the first paragraph of text among other paragraphs of text within the digital work; selecting, based at least in part on the ranking, the first paragraph of text; specifying the first paragraph of text for presentation in conjunction with a first set of paragraphs within the digital work; determining a related digital work, the related digital work corresponding to the digital work by at least one of common authorship, a common topic, or a common series; identifying a second paragraph of text and a third paragraph of text of the related digital work by at least one of: a number of interactions by human readers with the second paragraph of text or the third paragraph of text; or a number of reviews that reference the second paragraph of text or the third paragraph of text; identifying at least one of a topic or an entity included in the first paragraph of text; determining that the second paragraph of text and the third paragraph of text is associated with at least one of the topic or the entity; and generating a user interface configured to display at least one of the second paragraph of text or the third paragraph of text in conjunction with the first paragraph of text within the digital work, wherein the user interface includes a navigational element configured to allow navigation between the second paragraph of text and the third paragraph of text while displaying the first paragraph of text.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more non-transitory computer-readable media maintain instructions executable by the one or more processors to further perform acts comprising: visibly scrolling through the first set of paragraphs of the digital work to display the first paragraph of text; displaying, in conjunction with the first set of first paragraphs, a first timeline indicating first locations of individual paragraphs within the first set; visibly scrolling through a second set of paragraphs within the digital work; displaying, in conjunction with the second set of paragraphs, a second timeline indicating second locations of individual paragraphs within the second set; and wherein the first set and the second set relate to different characters within the digital work.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more non-transitory computer-readable media maintain instructions executable by the one or more processors to further perform acts comprising: determining a subject of the first paragraph of text, and wherein specifying the first paragraph of text for presentation in conjunction with the first set of paragraphs is based at least in part on the subject of the first paragraph of text, the first set of paragraphs relating to the subject.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more non-transitory computer-readable media maintain instructions executable by the one or more processors to further perform acts comprising: defining a first section of the digital work comprising a first set of contiguous paragraphs; defining a second section of the digital work comprising a second set of contiguous paragraphs; specifying a fourth paragraph of text from the first section of the digital work for presentation in conjunction with the digital work; and specifying a fifth paragraph of text from the second section of the digital work for presentation in conjunction with the digital work.
5. A method, comprising: receiving an indication of user interactions within digital content of a first digital work; determining a location of the user interactions within the digital content, wherein individual locations of a user interaction is determined based at least in part on metadata associated with words of the digital content; determining a first number of user interactions within a first excerpt of the digital content; determining a second number of user interactions within a second excerpt of the digital content; determining, based at least in part on the first number and the second number, a ranking of the first excerpt relative to the second excerpt; associating, based at least in part on the ranking being equal to or over a predefined threshold, the first excerpt with a first set of excerpts within the digital content; selecting the first set of excerpts; causing the first set of excerpts to be presented in conjunction with the digital content; determining related digital content of a second digital work, the related digital content corresponding to the digital content by at least one of common authorship, a common topic, or a common series; identifying a third excerpt and a fourth excerpt of the related digital content by at least one of: a third number of user interactions within the third excerpt or the fourth excerpt; or a number of reviews that reference the third excerpt or the fourth excerpt; identifying at least one of a topic or an entity included in the first excerpt; determining that the third excerpt and the fourth excerpt are associated with at least one of the topic or the entity; and generating a user interface configured to display at least one of the third excerpt or the fourth excerpt in conjunction with the first set of excerpts with the digital content, wherein the user interface includes a navigational element configured to allow navigation between the third excerpt and the fourth excerpt while displaying the first set of excerpts.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein receiving the indication is based at least in part on receiving one or more of annotating, quoting, sharing, or marking of the digital content.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein selecting the first set of excerpts comprises selecting a set of paragraphs within the digital content.
8. The method of claim 5, wherein selecting the first set of excerpts comprises selecting a set of highest ranking excerpts within the digital content.
9. The method of claim 5, further comprising: determining, by one or more first reviews of the digital content, a first number of references to the first excerpt; determining, by one or more second reviews of the digital content, a second number of references to the second excerpt; and wherein determining the ranking is further based at least in part on the first number of references and the second number of references.
10. The method of claim 5, wherein selecting the first set of excerpts comprises selecting, based at least in part on the ranking, one or more excerpts from each of multiple sections of the digital content.
11. The method of claim 5, further comprising constraining the first set of excerpts and a second set of excerpts to a common subject of the digital content.
12. The method of claim 5, further comprising: visibly scrolling through one or more first excerpts of the first set of excerpts to display a first selected excerpt from the first set of excerpts; displaying, in conjunction with the first set of excerpts, a first timeline indicating a first location of the first selected excerpt within the digital content; visibly scrolling through one or more second excerpts of a second set of excerpts to display a second selected excerpt of the second set of excerpts; displaying, in conjunction with the second set of excerpts, a second timeline indicating a second location of the second selected excerpt within the digital content; and wherein the first set of excerpts and the second set of excerpts relate to different subjects of the digital content.
