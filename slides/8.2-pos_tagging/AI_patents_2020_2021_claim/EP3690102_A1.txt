WASHING MACHINE AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING THE SAME
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a washing machine and a method for controlling the same; the washing machine according to the present invention includes a water storage tank (3), a vibration sensor (76) provided in the water storage tank (3), a washing tub (4) configured to accommodate laundry therein and rotatably disposed in the water storage tank (2), a motor (9) configured to rotate the washing tub (4), and a controller (60) configured to control the motor (9) to stop rotation of the washing tub (4) when an unbalance value, generated by the rotation of the washing tub, exceeds an allowable unbalance value included in a preset unbalance table, wherein the controller measures a dewatering time and a vibration value during a dewatering stroke using the vibration sensor, and changes the allowable unbalance value included in the preset unbalance table based on the dewatering time and the vibration value.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A washing machine, comprising: a water storage tank (3); a vibration sensor (76) provided in the water storage tank (3); a washing tub (4) configured to accommodate laundry therein and rotatably disposed in the water storage tank (3); a motor (9) configured to rotate the washing tub (4); and a controller (60) configured to control the motor (9) to stop rotation of the washing tub (4) when an unbalance, UB, value, generated by the rotation of the washing tub (4) during a dewatering stroke, exceeds an allowable UB value included in a preset UB table, wherein the controller (60) is adapted to measure a dewatering time and a vibration value during the dewatering stroke using the vibration sensor (76), and change the allowable UB value included in the preset UB table based on the dewatering time and the vibration value.
2. The washing machine of claim 1, wherein the controller (60) is
configured to
change the allowable UB value in the preset UB table based on the dewatering time and the vibration value, and
determine whether to stop the rotation of the washing tub (4) by comparing the changed allowable UB value with the UB value measured during the dewatering stroke.
3. The washing machine of claim 1 or 2, wherein the controller (60) is
configured to change the
allowable UB value in a different way according to the dewatering time and the vibration value.
4. The washing machine of claims 1, 2, or 3, wherein the controller (60) is configured to
increase the allowable UB value when the dewatering time exceeds an allowable time, and
decrease the allowable UB value when the vibration value exceeds an allowable vibration value.
5. The washing machine of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the controller (60) is configured to
increase the allowable UB value when an average of dewatering time, measured multiple times, exceeds the allowable time,
wherein the dewatering time measured multiple times, preferably is a predetermined number of dewatering time measured recently, and/or to decrease the allowable UB value when the measured vibration value exceeds the allowable vibration value even once, and/or to decrease the allowable UB value when the dewatering time exceeds the allowable time and the vibration value exceeds the allowable vibration value at the same time, and/or to maintain the allowable UB value when the dewatering time is equal to or lower than the allowable time and the vibration value is equal to or lower than the allowable vibration value.
6. The washing machine of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the controller (60) is configured to detect a
laundry amount and a laundry-tangled degree, and change the allowable UB value associated with the detected laundry amount and laundry-tangled degree in the preset UB table based on the dewatering time and the vibration value.
7. The washing machine of any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the controller performs the
dewatering stroke by using an allowable UB value applied to the highest laundry-tangled degree in detected laundry amounts when the dewatering time exceeds a preset dewatering time limit due to the decreased allowable UB value.
8. The washing machine of any one of claims 1 to 7, further comprising: an output unit (72), wherein the controller (60) is configured to control the output unit (72) to output information notifying that the allowable UB value has been changed.
9. The washing machine of any one of claims 1 to 7, further comprising: an output unit (72), wherein the controller (60) is configured to control the output unit (9) to output information notifying that a dewatering time or vibration noise has been reduced by the changed allowable UB value.
10. A method for controlling a washing machine, the method comprising: detecting a laundry amount and a laundry-tangled degree; measuring a dewatering time and a vibration value generated during a dewatering stroke; and changing an allowable unbalance, UB, value included in a preset UB table based on the dewatering time and the vibration value.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising:
determining whether to stop rotation of a washing tub (4) by comparing the changed allowable UB value with a UB value measured during the dewatering stroke.
12. The method of claim 10 or 11, wherein the changing step is configured to change the allowable UB value in a different way according to the
dewatering time and the vibration value.
13. The method of any one of claims 10 to 12, wherein the changing step is configured to increase the allowable UB value when the dewatering time exceeds an
allowable time, and
is configured to decrease the allowable UB value when the vibration value exceeds an allowable vibration value.
14. The method of any one of claims 10 to 13, wherein the changing step is configured
to decrease the allowable UB value when the dewatering time exceeds the allowable time, and the vibration value exceeds the allowable vibration value at the same time, and/or
to maintain the allowable UB value when the dewatering time is equal to or lower than the allowable time and the vibration value is equal to or lower than the vibration allowable value.
15. The method of any one of claims 9 to 14, further comprising:
performing the dewatering stroke using an allowable UB value associated with the highest laundry-tangled degree in detected laundry amounts when the dewatering time exceeds a preset dewatering time limit due to the decreased allowable UB value.
