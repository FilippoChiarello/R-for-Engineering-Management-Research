</title>

<abstract>
A peer to peer (P2P) bill sharing payment platform includes a first set of coded instructions instructing a user's smart phone to [1] establish a local network connection between the smart phone and a merchant's point of sale (POS) system, [2] receive an interactive ordering interface from the merchant's point of sale (POS) system with the interactive ordering interface displayed on a display device native to the smart phone, [3] record digital input from the user activity of selecting items listed in the interactive to ordering interface, the platform including a second set of coded instructions contained on a server, the second set of code instructing the server to receive order data over the network from the user's smart phone through the interactive order interface, and [4] send an electronic bill to the user's smart phone over the network and to receive payment from the user's smart phone over the network.

<claims>
1. A peer to peer (P2P) bill sharing payment platform comprising: a first set of coded instructions contained on a non-transitory medium resident on a user's smart phone connected to a network, the first set of code instructing the user's smart phone to: (a) establish a local network connection between the smart phone and a merchant's point of sale (POS) system, the connection, a P2P connection allowing merchant electronic recognition of the identification of the user; (b) receiving from the merchant's POS system over the network an interactive ordering interface, the interactive ordering interface displayed on a display device native to the smart phone; (c) record digital input from the user activity of selecting items listed in the interactive ordering interface; a second set of coded instructions contained on a non-transitory medium resident on a server connected to the network, the second set of code instructing the server to; (d) receive order data over the network from the user's smart phone through the interactive order interface; (e) generate and or send a generated electronic bill to the user's smart phone over the network; and (f) receive payment from the user's smart phone over the network.
2. The bill sharing payment platform of claim 1, wherein the user is one of a party of users sharing the bill.
3. The bill sharing payment platform of claim 1, wherein the network is the Internet network including any local connected sub networks.
4. The bill sharing payment platform of claim 1, wherein the POS system in step (a) is a service hosted on the Internet and is a POS system subscribed to by the merchant.
5. The bill sharing payment platform of claim 1, wherein the POS system in (a) is a P2P server hosted on a local network device owned and controlled by the merchant.
6. The bill sharing payment platform of claim 1, wherein the interactive order interface of (b) includes an interactive selection mechanism associated with each line item enabling user selection of line items in the interactive order interface.
7. The bill sharing payment platform of claim 6, wherein the interactive order interface of (b) further includes an interactive mechanism for enabling addition of user data identifying one or more other users to be associated to a user-selected (selected) line item signifying to the merchant an intent to share the selected item among the added users.
8. The bill sharing payment platform of claim 1, wherein the order data received in (d) from the user's smart phone through the interactive order interface includes order data input by the user and user names of any other users sharing one or more line items with the ordering user.
9. The bill sharing payment platform of claim 1, wherein all users in a party establish the connection in (a).
10. The bill sharing payment platform of claim 1, wherein the server sends each user in a party of users a version of the bill in (e) and wherein the server receives payment from each of the users through their connected smart phones in (f).
11. The bill sharing payment platform of claim 1, wherein the server sends one user in a party of users a version of the bill in (e) and wherein the server receives payment from that user through the user's smart phone (f) and wherein the server collects the funds from more than one account held by the user to satisfy payment of the bill.
12. The bill sharing payment platform of claim 10, wherein the payments received from individual ones of the users are debited from more than one account held by those users.
13. A peer to peer (P2P) bill sharing payment platform comprising: a set of coded instructions contained on a non-transitory medium resident on a user's smart phone connected to a network, the set of code instructing the user's smart phone to: (a) establish a local network (P2P) connection between the user and one or more other users' smart phone's Geo location-ally present at an establishment serviceable by a merchant, the connection allowing the users to share a paper bill generated by the merchant's POS system; (b) scan in or optically recognize the generated bill and render an electronic and interactive version of the generated bill of (a); (c) distribute a version of the electronically rendered and interactive bill of (b) to the smart phones of the one or more users of (a); (d) receive electronic payment from the one or more other users' smart phones of (a) for a portion or portions of the bill of (c); (f) deposit the electronic payments received in (d) into at least one payment account linked to a physical payment card used to pay the bill at the merchant's POS terminal or cash register.
14. The bill sharing platform of claim 13, wherein the network is a local wireless network.
15. The bill sharing platform of claim 13, wherein the interactive version of the bill of (c) includes at least one interactive mechanism for enabling association of one or more other users in (d) who shared the line item or items.
16. The bill sharing platform of claim 15, wherein the electronic payments received in (d) from the one or more other users' smart phones of (a) for a portion or portions of the bill of (c) include payments from different P2P accounts for one or more shared line items.
