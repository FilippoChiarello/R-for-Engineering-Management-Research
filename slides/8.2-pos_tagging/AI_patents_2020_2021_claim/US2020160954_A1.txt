PEER-REVIEW FLAGGING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A peer-review flagging system is operable to receive a medical scan and a medical report written by a medical professional in conjunction with review of the medical scan. Automated assessment data is generated by performing an inference function on the medical scan by utilizing a computer vision model trained on a plurality of medical scans. Human assessment data is generated by performing an extraction function on the medical report. Consensus data is generated by comparing the automated assessment data to the first human assessment data. A peer-review notification is transmitted to a client device for display. The peer-review notification indicates the medical scan is flagged for peer-review in response to determining the consensus data indicates the automated assessment data compares unfavorably to the human assessment data.
