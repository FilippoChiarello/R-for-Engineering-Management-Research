GENERATING A MEETING REVIEW DOCUMENT THAT INCLUDES LINKS TO ONE OR MORE DOCUMENTS REVIEWED
</title>

<abstract>
Artificial intelligence is introduced into document review to identify content suggestions from input to generate suggested annotations for the reviewed document. An approach is provided for receiving an electronic document that contains original content from an original electronic document for review and electronic mark-ups provided by a first user. One or more electronic mark-ups that represent content suggestions proposed by the first user are identified from the electronic document. For each electronic mark-up of the one or more electronic mark-ups identified a document portion of the original content that corresponds to the electronic mark-up is identified, and an annotation is generated for the electronic mark-up comprising the electronic mark-up and a first user ID for the first user and associating the annotation to the document portion identified. The original content with one or more annotations generated from the one or more electronic mark-ups is displayed, in electronic form, within a display window.
