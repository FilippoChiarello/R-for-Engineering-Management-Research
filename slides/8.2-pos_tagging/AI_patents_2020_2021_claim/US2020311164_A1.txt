<title>
A SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR RECOGNIZING ENVIRONMENT AND/OR LOCATION USING OBJECT IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES
</title>

<abstract>
The system and method of the present invention identify an environment or a location out of a sequence of information received in a video format. The invention provides a learning system and therefore the more videos that are received, relating to a specific environment/location, the more accurate the identification will be when a different image is later analyzed, including the ability to identify the environment/location seen from different viewpoint and angles.

<claims>
1. A method for identifying an environment and/or a location, comprising: a) receiving at least one video stream the frames of which contain images of an environment, details of an environment or of a location; b) extracting from said video stream a plurality of sequential frames, but not necessarily including all the frames in a sequence; c) generating a database associating a location or environment identification to each of said frames, said database containing identifying data related to one or more details contained in images of each of said frames; and d) comparing one or more detail of an image the location or environment of which it is desired to identify, with details of images contained in said database, to locate a location with matching details and thereby identifying their location or environment.
2. A method according to claim 1, comprising: a) receiving at least one video as an input and breaking said video into frames; b) automatically identifying the environment and/or location in each frame and associating each of said frames and each of the objects in said frame, to a location from a private image recognition database; c) if said location does not exist in said private image recognition database, identifying said location according to the audio of the video frame; d) if the location is not identified, using a public API database to identify said location and manually approving said identification and after such approval, adding said identified location to said private image recognition database; and e) identifying environment and/or location in a frame according to said associations of frames to environment and/or locations, and associations of objects in said frames to locations.
3. A method according to claim 1, further comprising the steps of: a) after identifying the location in a frame and associating said frame and objects to said location, filling gaps and removing uncertainties identifications of locations in frames; and b) adding to the operational database the new identified frames metadata and the association of said frames to a location.
4. A method according to claim 1, wherein the video stream is acquired using a crawler.
5. A method according to claim 1, wherein the comparison with details of images contained in said database is to locate one or more images with matching details and thereby identifying the location or environment.
6. A method for planning a trip using the method of claim 1, comprising the following steps: a. presenting videos with identified location or environment that are relevant to a requested destination; b. allowing the user to choose attractions he wants to visit by viewing the videos; c. outputting a trip plan recommendation according to said video location and to said user selection.
7. A method according to claim 4, wherein said additional data comprises text, photos, audio, maps reviews, descriptions and ratings.
8. A system for identifying an environment and/or a location, comprising: a) circuitry adapted to receive at least one video stream the frames of which contain images of an environment, details of an environment or of a location; b) a video parsing element adapted to extract from said video stream a plurality of sequential frames, not necessarily including all the frames in a sequence; c) a database suitable to associate a location or environment identification to each of said frames, said database containing identifying data related to one or more details contained in images of each of said frames; and d) comparing elements adapted to compare one or more detail of an image the location or environment of which it is desired to identify, with details of images contained in said database, to locate a location with matching details and thereby identifying their location or environment.
