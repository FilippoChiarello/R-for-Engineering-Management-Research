<title>
PASSENGER DETECTION SYSTEM FOR PASSENGER MOVING SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention refers a safety system for a passenger moving system comprising a monitoring means which is adapted to identify a body profile of a passenger.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A safety system (10) for a passenger moving system (100, 200, 300) comprising a
monitoring means (11)
characterized in,
that it is adapted to identify a body profile of a passenger (2).
2. The safety system (10) according to claim 1 , characterized in that the body profile of the passenger (2) comprises
- a standing position;
- a sitting position;
- any position there-between.
3. The safety system (10) according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in,
that it is adapted to measure an angle (Q) between one or more bones on the body of the passenger (2),
wherein the one or more bones on the body of the passenger (2) connect at a joint, said joint being rotatable about at least one axis (x, y, z).
4. The safety system (10) according to claim 3 characterized in that the measured angle (Q) is at least one selected from the group comprising:
- the angle between the foot and the lower leg (01);
- the angle between the lower leg and the upper leg (02);
- the angle between the upper leg and the torso (03);
- the angle between the upper arm and the lower arm (04);
- the angle between the torso and the head (05).
5. The safety system (10) according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the monitoring means (11) is adapted to monitor the passenger (2) in real time.
6. The safety system (10) according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the monitoring means (11) is adapted to monitor:
- the body profile of the passenger (2); and/or
- any changes in the body profile of the passenger (2)
in real time.
7. The safety system (10) according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the monitoring means (11) comprises a sensor wherein said sensor preferably comprises at least one of:
- a 3D sensor;
- a time of flight camera;
- a 360° camera;
- any combination of one or more of the above.
8. The safety system (10) according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in,
that the passenger moving system comprises:
- an elevator (100);
- an escalator (200);
- a moving walk (300).
9. A passenger moving system (100, 200, 300) comprising a safety system (10) according to any of the preceding claims.
10. A method of detecting whether a passenger (2) of a passenger moving system (100, 200, 300) is in a standing or a sitting position, comprising the method steps:
- positioning a safety system (10) according to any of the claims 1 to 8 at a location where it is able to monitor an area (W) comprising the passenger moving system (100, 200, 300);
- capturing at least one image of the passenger (2) in particular the body profile of the passenger (2) via a monitoring means (11);
- segmenting the at least one captured image of the body profile of the passenger (2) into human and non-human regions;
- implementing one or more data tools comprised within the system (10) to match the identified regions of the body profile of the passenger (2) with parts of the human skeleton;
- identifying and measuring at least one angle (Q1 , Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5) between one or more bones on the body profile of the passenger (2) wherein the one or more bones connect at a joint;
- determining whether the at least one measured angle (Q1 , Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5) corresponds to a body profile having a sitting or standing position;
- triggering an event if the at least one measured angle (Q1 , Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5) corresponds to a body profile having a sitting position.
11. Method according to claim 10 characterized in that the joint on the body of the passenger (2) is at least one selected from the group comprising:
- an ankle;
- a knee;
- a hip;
- a neck;
- any combination thereof.
12. Method according to any of claims 10 to 11 characterized in that the safety system (10) monitors the area (W) in real time and responds to changes in the body profile of the passenger (2) accordingly.
13. Method according to any of claims 10 to 12 characterized in that the passenger moving system comprises
- an elevator (100);
- an escalator (200);
- a moving walk (300).
