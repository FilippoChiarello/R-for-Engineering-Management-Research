SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SUPPORTING THE PREDICTION OF A FUTURE SIGNALING OF A TRAFFIC INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
</title>

<abstract>
A system supports a traffic participant while predicting a future signaling of a traffic infrastructure element. The system contains a storage device in which artificial intelligence is stored, wherein the artificial intelligence includes a predictive model for predicting a future signaling of the traffic infrastructure element, and a communication device for transmitting the artificial intelligence to a traffic participant via a communication network.

1. 1-15. (canceled)
16. A system for supporting a road user during a prediction of a future signaling of a traffic infrastructure element, the system comprising: a storage facility in which artificial intelligence is stored, the artificial intelligence containing a predictive model for predicting the future signaling of the traffic infrastructure element; and a communications facility for transmitting the artificial intelligence to the road user via a communications network.
17. The system according to claim 16, wherein the predictive model is embodied so as to predict the future signaling of the traffic infrastructure element based upon traffic data, wherein said communications facility is embodied so as to transmit the traffic data to the road user via the communications network.
18. The system according to claim 16, wherein the predictive model is embodied so as to predict the future signaling of the traffic infrastructure element based upon signaling data that describes a prevailing signaling of the traffic infrastructure element, and/or based upon switching time data that describes a prevailing switching time of the traffic infrastructure element, wherein said communications facility is embodied so as to transmit the signaling data and/or the switching time data to the road user via said communications network.
19. The system according to claim 16, wherein said communications facility is embodied so as not to transmit the artificial intelligence to the road user until at least one predetermined condition is met.
20. The system according to claim 19, wherein the at least one predetermined condition is respectively an element selected from the group of conditions consisting of: the road user is located within a predetermined distance with respect to the traffic infrastructure element, and receiving by means of said communications facility a request from the road user to transmit the artificial intelligence.
