<title>
Contactless position/distance sensor having an artificial neural network and method for operating the same
</title>

<abstract>
A contactless position and/or distance sensor for determining the distance, the spatial orientation, the material properties, or the like of a target object, and a method for operating the same, uses at least two sensor elements, which form a sensor module, Signals provided by the at least two sensor elements are jointly evaluated using at least one artificial neural network.
