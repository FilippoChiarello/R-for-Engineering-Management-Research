METHOD OF ADAPTING TUNING PARAMETER SETTINGS OF A SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY FOR ROAD VEHICLE SPEED ADJUSTMENT CONTROL
</title>

<abstract>
A method of adapting tuning parameter settings of a system (2) functionality (3) for road vehicle (1) speed adjustment control starting from initially selected settings and applying a training set of speed adjustment profiles obtained from manually negotiated road segments and road segment data for these. For each of these road segments: —a simulated speed adjustment profile is calculated using the selected settings and the road segment data; —the manual and the simulated speed adjustment profiles are compared to obtain a residual; —a norm of the residual is calculated. For all of the road segments of the training set: —a norm of the norms of the residuals is calculated; —at least one of optimization, regression analysis or machine-learning is performed to minimize the norm of the norms of the residuals by selecting different settings and iterating the above steps. Settings rendering a minimal training set norm are selected.
