An embodiment of a system includes a light source, an optical assembly, and an electronic circuit. The light source (e.g., a laser) is configured to generate a source optical signal. The optical assembly is configured to direct the source optical signal into an end of an optical-fiber assembly that includes an optical fiber having a section wrapped multiple turns around a mandrel and including mandrel zones, and to receive, from the end of the optical-fiber assembly, a return optical signal. The electronic circuit is configured to select at least one mandrel zone in response to a component of the return optical signal from the at least one mandrel zone, and to detect an acoustic signal incident on the mandrel in response to the component of the return optical signal.
