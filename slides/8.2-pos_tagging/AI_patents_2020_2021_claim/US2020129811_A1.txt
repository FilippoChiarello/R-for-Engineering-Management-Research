Method of Coaching an Athlete Using Wearable Body Monitors
</title>

<abstract>
A method of providing coaching or teaching a training regimen, trick shot, athletic motion, workout program, ergonomic trade secret. The method of providing coaching information by a user at a remote location to another user at another remote location via digital communication. The coaching information is obtained from sensors worn on the body of an athlete. The sensors provide both biomechanics and physiological data. The sensors provide data to a server that can analyze the movement of the athlete. The analyze data can be stored and labeled. The data can then be accessed for display on another users preferred device. The user can then attempt the motion and will receive biofeedback from the sensors worn.

<claims>
I claim:
1. A method for providing live and archived athletic and ergonomic motions lessons to remote users comprising: identifying, by one or more computing devices and one or more sensors, a first user's motion, the motion having metrics and analytics; providing information about coaching lesson that can be accessed via a digital communication network to a second user's; sending coaching lesson content from a server to a second user's device; displaying said coaching lesson on second user's device; detecting, by one or more computing devices and one or more sensors, a second user's deviations from the coaching lesson content;
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the content sent to the second user's device is archived content provided from a database.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the content sent to the second user's device is streamed in real time.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising displaying content comprising the selected coaching lesson on the display screen associated with the second user.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the detected deviations from the second user are sent to the first user's device is archived content provided from a database.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the detected deviations are sent to the first user's device is streamed in real time.
7. A computer-implemented coaching method comprising: identifying, by one or more computing devices and one or more sensors, a first user's motion, the motion having metrics and analytics; providing information about coaching lesson that can be accessed via a digital communication network to a second user's; sending coaching lesson content from a server to a second user's device; displaying said coaching lesson on second user's device; detecting, by one or more computing devices and one or more sensors, a second user's deviations from the coaching lesson content;
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the content sent to the second user's device is archived content provided from a database.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the content sent to the second user's device is streamed in real time.
10. The method of claim 7, further comprising displaying content comprising the selected coaching lesson on the display screen associated with the second user.
11. The method of claim 7, wherein the detected deviations from the second user are sent to the first user's device is archived content provided from a database.
12. The method of claim 7, wherein the detected deviations are sent to the first user's device is streamed in real time.
13. A system comprising one or more computing devices and one or more sensors configured to: identifying, by one or more computing devices and one or more sensors, a first user's motion, the motion having metrics and analytics; providing information about coaching lesson that can be accessed via a digital communication network to a second user's; sending coaching lesson content from a server to a second user's device; displaying said coaching lesson on second user's device; detecting, by one or more computing devices and one or more sensors, a second user's deviations from the coaching lesson content;
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the content sent to the second user's device is archived content provided from a database.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein the content sent to the second user's device is streamed in real time.
16. The method of claim 13, further comprising displaying content comprising the selected coaching lesson on the display screen associated with the second user.
17. The method of claim 13, wherein the detected deviations from the second user are sent to the first user's device is archived content provided from a database.
18. The method of claim 13, wherein the detected deviations are sent to the first user's device is streamed in real time.
19. A non-transitory computer-readable medium on which instructions are stored, the instructions, when executed by one or more processors cause the one or more processors to perform a method, the method comprising: identifying, by one or more computing devices and one or more sensors, a first user's motion, the motion having metrics and analytics; providing information about coaching lesson that can be accessed via a digital communication network to a second user's; sending coaching lesson content from a server to a second user's device; displaying said coaching lesson on second user's device; detecting, by one or more computing devices and one or more sensors, a second user's deviations from the coaching lesson content;
20. The method of claim 19, wherein the content sent to the second user's device is archived content provided from a database.
21. The method of claim 19, wherein the content sent to the second user's device is streamed in real time.
22. The method of claim 19, further comprising displaying content comprising the selected coaching lesson on the display screen associated with the second user.
23. The method of claim 19, wherein the detected deviations from the second user are sent to the first user's device is archived content provided from a database.
24. The method of claim 19, wherein the detected deviations are sent to the first user's device is streamed in real time.
