<title>
NETWORK COMPUTING SYSTEM FOR REAL-TIME EVENT ANALYSIS
</title>

<abstract>
A network computing system, and method for implementing a network computing system, to analyze events accumulated over digital channels of an enterprise, for purpose of determining contextual and/or customized outputs that facilitate a desired objective of the enterprise.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computing system comprising: one or more processors; a memory to store a set of instructions; wherein the one or more processors access the instructions to: record a sequence of activities that the user is detected as performing; analyze the sequence of user activities in connection with a current user activity to predict a user intent; and initiate an event to cause the user to perform a desired user action based on the predicted user intent.
2. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the one or more processors detect multiple predefined activities of the user over the given time interval, including a first activity detected using a first user interface component, and a second activity using a second user interface component.
3. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the one or more processors detect a first activity of the multiple activities as an online activity, and a second activity of the multiple activities as a real-world activity.
4. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the one or more processors detect a first activity of the multiple activities as an online activity, and detect the current activity as a real-world activity.
5. The computer system of claim 4, wherein the one or more processors detect the real-world activity by detecting a location and/or heading of the user.
6. The computer system of claim 1, wherein the one or more processors detect the real-world activity by detecting that the user is either at or near a locality where the desired user action may be performed by the user.
7. The computer system of claim 6, wherein the one or more processors initiate the event by sending a communication to the user to cause the user to go into and/or perform the desired user action at the locality.
8. The computer system of claim 6, wherein the one or more processors initiate the event by providing a promotion that is to make the user more likely to perform the desired user action at the locality.
9. The computing system of claim 1, wherein the one or more processors analyze the user activity in connection with monitoring a location of the user.
10. The computing system of claim 9, wherein the one or more processors monitor the location of the user to detect at least one of (i) a proximity of the user to a specific third-party locality, or (ii) a heading of the user to the specific third-party locality.
11. The computing system of claim 10, wherein the one or more processors initiate the event at the third-party locality.
12. The computer system of claim 10, wherein the one or more processors initiate the event by: sending a communication to the user, to influence the user to travel to a third-party locality, to travel to a particular location within the third-party locality, and/or to inquire about a particular product or service.
13. The computer system of claim 10, wherein the one or more processors initiate the event by: sending a communication to a device associated with the third-party locality, to identify an item to engage the user.
