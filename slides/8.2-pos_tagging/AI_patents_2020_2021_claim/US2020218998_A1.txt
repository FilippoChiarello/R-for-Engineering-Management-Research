IDENTIFICATION OF NON-DETERMINISTIC MODELS OF MULTIPLE DECISION MAKERS
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments for identifying stochastic models representing the individual decision makers in a computing environment by a processor. One or more non-deterministic (stochastic, probabilistic) models may be identified according to a sequence of outcomes from decisions of each of a plurality of decision makers.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method, by a processor, for implementing identification of predictive models in a computing environment, comprising: identifying one or more non-deterministic models according to a sequence of outcomes from decisions of each of a plurality of decision makers.
2. The method of claim 1, further including receiving one or more time series of actions, wherein each of the actions is executed by one of the plurality of decision makers.
3. The method of claim 2, further including describing each of the one or more time series actions according to a categorical variable, a continuous variable, or a combination thereof.
4. The method of claim 1, further including receiving a specification of a structure of a decision model employed by each one of the plurality of decision makers.
5. The method of claim 1, further including defining a switching policy enabling each of the plurality of decision makers to provide a decision at selected time instances.
6. The method of claim 5, further allowing for the switching policy to enable each of the plurality of decision makers to provide a decision at selected time instances to depend on a state of the system affected by the decisions.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the non-deterministic models are probabilistic such that decisions have a fixed probability depending on a state of the system affected by the decisions.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the non-deterministic models suggest scores for decisions that depend on the state of the system affected by the decisions.
9. The method of claim 1, further including estimating a user behavior model from a repository of model structures according to scores associated with the decisions of each of a plurality of decision makers.
10. A system for implementing identification of predictive models in a computing environment, comprising: one or more computers with executable instructions that when executed cause the system to: identify one or more non-deterministic models according to a sequence of outcomes from decisions of each of a plurality of decision makers.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the executable instructions further receive one or more time series actions executed by each one of the plurality of decision makers.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the executable instructions further describe each of the one or more time series actions according to a categorical variable, a continuous variable, or a combination thereof.
13. The system of claim 10, wherein the executable instructions further receive a specification of a structure of a decision model employed by each one of the plurality of decision makers.
14. The system of claim 10, wherein the executable instructions further define a switching policy enabling each of the plurality of decision makers to provide a decision at selected time instances.
15. The system of claim 10, wherein the executable instructions further score each of the decisions according to a probability the decision being selected by of each of the plurality of decision makers.
16. The system of claim 10, wherein the executable instructions further estimate a user behavior model from a repository of model structures according to scores associated with the decisions of each of a plurality of decision makers.
17. A computer program product for implementing intelligent identification of predictive models by a processor, the computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable program code portions stored therein, the computer-readable program code portions comprising: an executable portion that cognitively identifies one or more non-deterministic models according to a sequence of outcomes from decisions of each of a plurality of decision makers.
18. The computer program product of claim 17, further including an executable portion that: receives one or more time series actions executed by each one of the plurality of decision makers; and describes each of the one or more time series actions according to a categorical variable, a continuous variable, or a combination thereof.
19. The computer program product of claim 17, further including an executable portion that receives a specification of a structure of a decision model employed by each one of the plurality of decision makers.
20. The computer program product of claim 17, further including an executable portion that defines a switching policy enabling each of the plurality of decision makers to provide a decision at selected time instances.
21. The computer program product of claim 17, further including an executable portion that scores each of the decisions according to a probability the decision being selected by of each of the plurality of decision makers.
22. The computer program product of claim 17, further including an executable portion that estimates a user behavior model from a repository of model structures according to scores associated with the decisions of each of a plurality of decision makers.
