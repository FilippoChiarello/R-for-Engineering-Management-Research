System and method for communicating digital data using media content
</title>

<abstract>
The embodiments herein disclose an apparatus and method especially developed for the direct application in transmission involving user devices with some computational potential, allowing data transmission between two devices in a secure manner using media content. The method for the transmission of data between two devices comprises the following steps: receiving a digital data and a media content as input, encoding the digital data, embedding the digital data into a media content, modulating the data using radio frequency (RF) signals, transmitting the modulated RF signals, capturing the modulated RF signals by the receiver module, demodulating the modulated RF signal to obtain an encoded media content and decoding the media content for recovering the digital data.
