<title>
Method and system for regression and classification in subsurface models to support decision making for hydrocarbon operations
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system are described for hydrocarbon exploration, development and production. The method relates to performing regression and/or classification in subsurface models to support decision making for hydrocarbon operations. The evaluation may then be used in performing hydrocarbon operations, such as hydrocarbon exploration, hydrocarbon development and/or hydrocarbon production.
