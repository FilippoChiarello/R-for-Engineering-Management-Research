<title>
Counterintuitive recommendations based upon temporary conditions
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for providing counter intuitive recommendations to a user. A user profile is obtained for the user. A determination is made that a trigger condition has occurred for the user. The duration of the trigger condition is also determined. The trigger condition is associated with the user's profile. A request for a recommendation is received, and a list of recommendations is obtained. The recommendations are compared against the trigger condition to determine if the recommendation is compatible with the trigger condition. Those recommendations determined not to be compatible with the trigger condition are removed from the set of recommendations.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for providing counter intuitive recommendations to a user comprising: determining that a trigger condition has occurred to the user; associating the determined trigger condition with a user profile; receiving a request for a recommendation; generating a set of recommendations based on the user profile; determining if recommendations in the set of recommendations are compatible with the trigger condition; and removing from the set of recommendation those recommendations that are determined not to be compatible with the trigger condition.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein removing filters the set of recommendations.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the trigger condition is determined by analyzing information related to the user from data sources used to generate the user profile.
4. The method of claim 3 wherein the trigger condition is determined from a post to a social media site.
5. The method of claim 3 wherein determining the duration of the trigger condition is determined from a post to a social media site.
6. The method of claim 3 wherein determining the duration of the trigger condition is determined by analyzing electronic documents related to the trigger condition.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein associating the trigger condition with the user profile does not modify the user profile.
8. The method of claim 1 further comprising removing the association between the trigger condition and the user profile after the duration of the trigger condition has passed.
9. A computer program product embodied on one or more non-transitory computer readable storage mediums, having computer executable instructions that when executed by at least one computer having at least one processor, executes a method for providing counter intuitive recommendations to a user comprising: determining that a trigger condition has occurred to the user; associating the determined trigger condition with a user profile; receiving a request for a recommendation; generating a set of recommendations based on the user profile; determining if recommendations in the set of recommendations are compatible with the trigger condition; and removing from the set of recommendation those recommendations that are determined not to be compatible with the trigger condition.
10. The computer program product of claim 9 wherein removing filters the set of recommendations.
11. The computer program product of claim 9 wherein the trigger condition is determined by analyzing information related to the user from data sources used to generate the user profile.
12. The computer program product of claim 11 wherein the trigger condition is determined from a post to a social media site.
13. The computer program product of claim 11 wherein determining the duration of the trigger condition is determined from a post to a social media site.
14. The computer program product of claim 11 wherein determining the duration of the trigger condition is determined by analyzing electronic documents related to the trigger condition.
15. The computer program product of claim 9 wherein associating the trigger condition with the user profile does not modify the user profile.
16. The computer program product of claim 9 further comprising removing the association between the trigger condition and the user profile after the duration of the trigger condition has passed.
17. A recommendation system configured to provide counter intuitive recommendations to at least one user comprising: at least one processor; at least one memory component; a recommender engine configured to provide a recommendation to the at least one user; the recommendation system configured to execute a method of: determining that a trigger condition has occurred to the user; associating the determined trigger condition with a user profile; receiving a request for a recommendation; generating a set of recommendations based on the user profile; determining if recommendations in the set of recommendations are compatible with the trigger condition; and removing from the set of recommendation those recommendations that are determined not to be compatible with the trigger condition.
18. The system of claim 17 wherein removing filters the set of recommendations.
19. The system of claim 17 wherein the trigger condition is determined by analyzing information related to the user from data sources used to generate the user profile.
20. The system of claim 19 wherein the trigger condition is determined from a post to a social media site, and wherein determining the duration of the trigger condition is determined from a post to a social media site.
