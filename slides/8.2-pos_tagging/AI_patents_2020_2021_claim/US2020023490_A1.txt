POLISHING APPARATUS AND POLISHING METHOD FOR POLISHING A PERIPHERY OF A SUBSTRATE
</title>

<abstract>
A polishing apparatus capable of accurately detecting a polishing end point of a periphery of a substrate, such as a wafer, is disclosed. The polishing apparatus includes a polishing head configured to press a polishing tool against the periphery of the substrate on a substrate holding surface. The polishing head includes a pressing member configured to press the polishing tool against the periphery of the substrate, and a shear-force detection sensor configured to detect a shear force acting on the pressing member and output an index value indicating a magnitude of the shear force. An operation controller has a memory storing a program configured to determine a polishing end point at which the index value reaches a threshold value, and a processer configured to execute the program.
