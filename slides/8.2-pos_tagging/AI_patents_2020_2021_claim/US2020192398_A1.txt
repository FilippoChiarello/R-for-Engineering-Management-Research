<title>
Detecting Unfamiliar Signs
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the disclosure relate to determining a sign type of an unfamiliar sign. The system may include one or more processors. The one or more processors may be configured to receive an image and identify image data corresponding to a traffic sign in the image. The image data corresponding to the traffic sign may be input in a sign type model. The processors may determine that the sign type model was unable to identify a type of the traffic sign and determine one or more attributes of the traffic sign. The one or more attributes of the traffic sign may be compared to known attributes of other traffic signs and based on this comparison, a sign type of the traffic sign may be determined. The vehicle may be controlled in an autonomous driving mode based on the sign type of the traffic sign.

<claims>
1. A method of controlling an autonomous vehicle in response to detecting and analyzing an unfamiliar traffic sign, the method comprising: receiving, by one or more processors, an image generated by a perception system of a vehicle; identifying, by the one or more processors, image data corresponding to a traffic sign in the image; inputting, by the one or more processors, the image data corresponding to the traffic sign into one or more system software modules running on the one or more processors; determining, by the one or more processors, that the traffic sign in the image is an unfamiliar traffic sign that cannot be identified by the one or more system software modules; in response to determining that the type of the traffic sign in the image is an unfamiliar traffic sign, identifying, by the one or more processors, one or more attributes of the unfamiliar traffic sign; in response to determining that the traffic sign in the image is an unfamiliar traffic sign, comparing, by the one or more processors, the one or more attributes of the unfamiliar traffic sign to known attributes of other traffic signs; determining, by the one or more processors, the type of the unfamiliar traffic sign based on the comparing; and controlling, by the one or more processors, the vehicle in an autonomous driving mode based on the determined type of the unfamiliar traffic sign.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the known attributes of other traffic signs are stored in at least one data structure.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the type of the traffic sign cannot be identified to a minimum confidence level.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more attributes of the unfamiliar traffic sign are determined using image processing techniques.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the attributes include one or more of traffic sign type, color, shape, reflection coefficient, placement, text, figures, or accessories.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining content of the unfamiliar traffic sign by comparing the one or more attributes of the unfamiliar traffic sign to known attributes of other traffic signs.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the content of the unfamiliar traffic sign is informative or instructive.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the type of the traffic sign includes one or more of regulatory, warning, guide, services, recreation, construction, or school zone.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the controlling the vehicle in the autonomous driving mode based on the determined type of the traffic sign includes taking no action based on the determined type of the traffic sign.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the controlling the vehicle in the autonomous driving mode based on the determined type of the traffic sign includes: determining that content of the traffic sign is instructive of an action; and performing the action.
11. A system for controlling an autonomous vehicle in response to detecting and analyzing an unfamiliar traffic sign, the system comprising: a memory device; and one or more processors coupled to the memory device, wherein the one or more processors are configured to: receive an image generated by a perception system of a vehicle; identify image data corresponding to a traffic sign in the image; input the image data corresponding to the traffic sign into one or more system software modules running on the one or more processors; determine that a type of the traffic sign in the image is an unfamiliar traffic sign that cannot be identified by the one or more system software modules; in response to determining that the type of the traffic sign in the image is an unfamiliar traffic sign, identify one or more attributes of the unfamiliar traffic sign; in response to determining that the type of the traffic sign in the image is an unfamiliar traffic sign, perform a comparison of the one or more attributes of the unfamiliar traffic sign to known attributes of other traffic signs; determine the type of the traffic sign based on the comparison; and control the vehicle in an autonomous driving mode based on the determined type of the traffic sign.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the known attributes of other traffic signs are stored in at least one data structure.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the known attributes of other traffic signs are manually labeled by an operator and/or by using image processing techniques.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the one or more attributes of the unfamiliar traffic sign are determined using image processing techniques.
15. The system of claim 11, wherein the attributes include one or more of traffic sign type, color, shape, reflection coefficient, placement, text, figures, or accessories.
16. The system of claim 11, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to determine content of the unfamiliar traffic sign by comparing the one or more attributes of the unfamiliar traffic sign to known attributes of other traffic signs.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein the content of the unfamiliar traffic sign is informative or instructive.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the vehicle is controlled in the autonomous driving mode to take no action based on the determined sign type of the traffic sign.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein the vehicle is controlled in the autonomous driving mode to determine content of the traffic sign is instructive of an action, and perform the action.
20. The system of claim 11, wherein the system includes the vehicle.
