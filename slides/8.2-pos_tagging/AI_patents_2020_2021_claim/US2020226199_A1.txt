<title>
METHOD AND NETWORK NODE FOR INTERNET-OF-THINGS (IOT) FEATURE SELECTION FOR STORAGE AND COMPUTATION
</title>

<abstract>
The method includes compiling data into mutual information columns, determining mutual information for each pairing of the mutual information columns and creating a matrix using the mutual information, the matrix including a first set of data columns, wherein each of the first set of data columns represents at least one feature of the data. The method further includes computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix, ordering the eigenvalues using an absolute value of the eigenvalues, iteratively selecting at least one second set of data columns by successively removing data columns from the first set of data columns based on the ordered eigenvalues, and controlling an operation of an electronic device based on the at least one second set of data.
