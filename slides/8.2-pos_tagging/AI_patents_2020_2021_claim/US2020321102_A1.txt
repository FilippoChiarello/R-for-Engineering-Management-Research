<title>
COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY APPROACH FOR RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF TISSUE-BASED COMPANION DIAGNOSTIC DRIVEN CLINICAL TRIAL STUDIES
</title>

<abstract>
Automated systems and methods are presented for retrospectively analyzing clinical trial data. A plurality of image derived from biological samples of patients in a cohort population are accessed. Image features are computed based on the plurality of images. A diagnostic feature metric is derived based on the computed image features. A cut point value is determined by applying a statistical minimization method using the derived diagnostic feature metric and patient outcome data from the cohort population, in which the cut point value identifies a patient in the cohort population as positive or negative for a diagnostic test.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: accessing a plurality of images derived from biological samples of patients in a cohort population, the biological samples having at least one stain; computing, based on the plurality of images, one or more image features; deriving a diagnostic feature metric based on the computed image features; and determining a cut point value by applying a statistical minimization method using the derived diagnostic feature metric and patient outcome data from the cohort population, wherein the cut point value identifies a patient in the cohort population as positive or negative for a diagnostic test.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the diagnostic feature metric is an expression score that is selected from the group consisting of an H-score, and Allred score, percent positivity, and an immunohistochemistry combination score.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the diagnostic feature metric is a weighted combination of multiple image features or expression scores.
4. The method of claim 5, wherein the pre-determined multiple image features or expression scores are pre-determined are combined using a multivariate Cox model.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the diagnostic feature metric is derived from a plurality of prognostic features, wherein the plurality of prognostic features are generated using a trained classifier.
6. The method of claim 7, wherein the plurality of prognostic features are combined using a multivariate Cox model for stratifying the cohort population.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the statistical minimization method is a log rank statistic minimization.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the patient outcome data is a primary end point data.
9. The method of claim 10, wherein the primary end point data is overall survival.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising stratifying the patients into diagnostic positive and diagnostic negative groups based on the determined cut point value.
11. The method of claim 12, further comprising generating Kaplan-Meier response curves of the diagnostic positive and diagnostic negative groups, wherein the Kaplan-Meier response curves indicate a percentage of patients surviving over a period of time.
12. The method of claim 13, further comprising calculating hazard ratios based on a slope identified from the generated response curves.
13. A system comprising: one or more processors; and a non-transitory computer-readable memory storing instructions which, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to: access a plurality of images derived from biological samples of patients in a cohort population, the biological samples having at least one stain; compute, based on the plurality of image, a plurality of image features; derive a diagnostic feature metric from the plurality of computed image features, wherein the plurality of computed image features are combined using a multivariate Cox model; and apply a statistical minimization to derive a cut point value that identifies a patient in the cohort population as positive or negative for a diagnostic test, the statistical minimization utilizing the derived diagnostic feature metric and patient outcome data.
14. The system of claim 16, wherein the plurality of computed image features to be combined are pre-determined.
15. The system of claim 16, wherein the plurality of computed image features to be combined are determined using a classifier trained to identify one or more attributes that are likely to predict a patient response.
16. The system of claim 16, wherein the cohort population is a placebo population.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein the statistical minimization method is a log rank statistic minimization.
18. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium encoded with instructions executable by a processor of a computing system to cause the computing system to: access a plurality of images derived from biological samples of patients in a cohort population, the biological samples having at least one stain; compute, based on the plurality of images, a plurality of image features; derive a diagnostic feature metric from the plurality of computed image features, wherein the plurality of computed image features are combined using a multivariate Cox model for stratifying the cohort population; apply a log rank statistical minimization to derive a cut point value, the log rank statistical minimization utilizing the derived diagnostic feature metric and patient outcome data; and stratify the patients in the cohort population into diagnostic positive and diagnostic negative groups based on the derived cut point value.
19. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 21, further comprising instructions for generating Kaplan-Meier response curves.
20. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 22, further comprising instructions for calculating hazard ratios based on the generated response curves.
