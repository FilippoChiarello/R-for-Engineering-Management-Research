Sensorized Robotic Gripping Device
</title>

<abstract>
A robotic gripping device is provided. The robotic gripping device includes a palm and a plurality of digits coupled to the palm. The robotic gripping device also includes a time-of-flight sensor arranged on the palm such that the time-of-flight sensor is configured to generate time-of-flight distance data in a direction between the plurality of digits. The robotic gripping device additionally includes an infrared camera, including an infrared illumination source, where the infrared camera is arranged on the palm such that the infrared camera is configured to generate grayscale image data in the direction between the plurality of digits.
