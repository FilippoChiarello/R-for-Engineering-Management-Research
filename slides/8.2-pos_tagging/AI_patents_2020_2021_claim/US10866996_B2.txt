<title>
Automated method and system for clustering enriched company seeds into a cluster and selecting best values for each attribute within the cluster to generate a company profile
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems are provided for automatically generating company profiles. Independent seed source services each crawl web pages to collect seeds from different web-based sources. A seed enricher module can then fetch additional information for each of the collected seeds from other different web-based sources and generate an enriched company seed for each collected seed. The enriched company seeds can then be automatically clustered into different clusters that each represent a particular company. A particular value for each attribute of each cluster that is determined to have the highest score can then be selected for inclusion in a corresponding company profile for that cluster.
