<title>
System and Method for Surface Feature Detection and Transversal
</title>

<abstract>
Substantially discontinuous surface feature traversal feature of the present teachings can leverage a transport device (TD), for example, but not limited to, an autonomous device or a semi-autonomous device, to navigate in environments that can include features such as substantially discontinuous surface features. The substantially discontinuous surface feature traversal feature can enable the TD to travel on an expanded variety of surfaces. In particular, substantially discontinuous surface features can be accurately identified and labeled so that the TD can automatically maintain the performance of the TD during ingress and egress of the substantially discontinuous surface feature.
