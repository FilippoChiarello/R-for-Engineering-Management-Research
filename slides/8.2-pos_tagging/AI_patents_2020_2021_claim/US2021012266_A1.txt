AUGMENTED MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An augmented management system and method for guiding leader standard work in a manufacturing environment. A leader location monitor collects leader location data and a leader action monitor for collecting leader action data. A machine tap collects performance data and the collected data is stored in one or more databases. A prescriptive analytics engine analyzing the leader behavior performance and suggests a change in leader behavior that will contribute to process health.

<claims>
1. An augmented management system comprising: a leader location monitor for collecting leader location data in a manufacturing environment; a machine tap for collecting machine data; a database of performance data for storing the machine data and context data; a database of leader behavior for storing the leader location data; a prescriptive analytics engine for analyzing the leader location data and the performance data; and an alert engine for providing an alert to the leader to guide leader behavior.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the leader location data comprises at least one of leader location in the manufacturing environment, duration of time spent at the location, speed of movement through the manufacturing environment, path of movement through the manufacturing environment, time of movement, and identification of at least one other team member in the manufacturing environment.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the alert is delivered to one or more of a laptop, smartphone, mobile device, augmented reality device, conversational voice assistant, or optical feedback device.
4. The system of claim 1, further comprising an input device for tagging the leader location data to provide additional information about leader behavior.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the alert engine uses at least one of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the prescriptive analytics engine uses at least one of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the leader location monitor comprises a trackable leader mobile device and at least three anchor nodes in the manufacturing environment.
8. The system of claim 1, further comprising one or more team member location monitors.
9. The system of claim 1, where the alert is provided to the leader on one of a task list, action card, floor plan map, and queued audio list.
10. The system of claim 1, further comprising a leader action monitor for collecting leader action data.
11. A method for augmented management comprising: collecting leader location data for a leader in a manufacturing environment; collecting performance data for the manufacturing environment; storing the leader location data and the performance data in at least one database; analyzing the leader location data and the performance data in a prescriptive analytics engine; and generating an alert to guide leader behavior, wherein the guidance results in a change to process health of the manufacturing environment.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein generating an alert sends out an alert in real-time.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein generating an alert comprises delivering an alert to one or more of a laptop, smartphone, mobile device, augmented reality device, conversational voice assistant, or optical feedback device.
14. The method of claim 11, further comprising recording leader reaction time for responding to the alert.
15. The method of claim 11, wherein the prescriptive analytics engine analyzes the leader location data and the performance data using at least one of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
16. The method of claim 11, further comprising tracking location of one or more team members in the manufacturing environment.
17. The method of claim 11, wherein the leader location data comprises at least one of leader location in the manufacturing environment, duration of time spent at the location, speed of movement through the manufacturing environment, path of movement through the manufacturing environment, time of movement, and identification of at least one other team member in the manufacturing environment.
18. The method of claim 11, further comprising: collecting leader action data; and analyzing the leader action data in the prescriptive analytics engine, wherein the leader action data comprises at least one of time and timing of report reading, timing and duration of meetings, scripts used during meetings, amount of time spent on the manufacturing floor during a shift, time of huddle during shift, duration of huddle, amount of time spent on one-on-one mentoring, and amount of time in a huddle spent on particular aspects of process health.
19. The method of claim 11, further comprising limiting the number of generated alerts to below a daily threshold limit.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein the alert is generated based on threshold opportunity for the alert.
