<title>
System and method for predictive curation, production infrastructure, and personal content assistant
</title>

<abstract>
Data points, calendar entries, trends, behavioral patterns may be used to predict and pre-emptively build digital and printable products with selected collections of images without the user's active participation. The collections are selected from files on the user's device, cloud-based photo library, or other libraries shared among other individuals and grouped into thematic products. Based on analysis of the user's collections and on-line behaviors, the system may estimate types and volumes of potential media-centric products, and the resources needed for producing and distributing such media-centric products for a projected period of time. A user interface may take the form of a "virtual curator", which is a graphical or animated persona for augmenting and managing interactions between the user and the system managing the user's stored media assets. The virtual curator can assume one of many personas, as appropriate, with each user. For example, the virtual curator can be presented as an avatar-animated character in an icon, or icon that floats around the screen. The virtual curator can also interact with the user via text messaging, or audio messaging.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A computer-implemented method configured to be performed on a networked computational device comprising a processor, the method comprising: the processor taking inventory of multimedia assets stored on a storage unit of the networked computational device and stored on a remote server via a social media account; the processor taking inventory of user social interactions with the multimedia assets; the processor deriving metadata from the inventory of multimedia assets and the inventory of user social interactions with the multimedia assets; storing the derived metadata on the storage unit of the networked computational device; generating and displaying to a user, via a display on the networked computational device, interactive user profile questions; receiving and storing, on the storage unit, answers to the user profile questions; selecting a user persona from a set of predetermined user personas that most closely associates with the user based on the derived metadata and the answers to the user profile questions, wherein the user persona comprises an interactive digital user profile; presenting the user persona to the user, via the display on the networked computational device, for interaction with the user; proposing to the user, via the display on the networked computational device, a media product, based on an interaction between the user persona and the user.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising, prior to selecting the user persona, receiving a user selection of interaction frequency and interaction modality, and wherein selecting the user persona is further based on the user's selections for interaction frequency and interaction modality.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the selected user persona determines a proactive interaction modality with respect to one or more of: appearance, format, communication style, language, pacing, directness, subtly, emotions and frequency of communication.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the proactive interaction modality is adapted to accommodate ethnic and cultural preferences.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein interaction between the user persona and the user includes one or more events selected from the group consisting of: making recommendations of customized media products, identifying special multimedia assets, and recommending image modifications to one or more of the multimedia assets.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising the processor determining which of the multimedia assets are important multimedia assets based on the user social interactions with the multimedia assets.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the important multimedia assets include multimedia assets that have been used by the user on the user's social media account and multimedia assets that have been shared by the user on the user's social media account.
8. The method of claim 6, further comprising creating and presenting to the user, via the display on the device, a virtual version of a media product that incorporates at least one of the important multimedia assets.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising the user persona providing the user, via the display on the device, an option to select, modify, or request an alternative to the presented virtual version of the media product.
10. The method of claim 8, further comprising the user persona presenting the user, via the display on the device, an option to purchase the media product represented by the virtual version presented on the display.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the media product is selected from the group consisting of: a hardcopy print, a photo album, a photo calendar, a photo greeting card, a posterns, a collagens, a soft display digital multimedia slide show, and a digital movie.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the media product is customized with assistance from a remote operator, by a crowd sourced operator, or by the user.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein taking inventory of the social interactions with the multimedia assets comprises monitoring media recordings and frequencies and durations of: recording, viewing, sharing, editing, manipulating, or rating the multimedia assets.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the media product incorporates one or more of: professionally produced or crowd-sourced graphics, clip art, music, audio, narration, text, transitions, special effects, 3-D rendered objects and environments, still images, and videos sequences.
15. The method of claim 1, further comprising proposing to the user, via the display on the device, a recipient for the media product.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein the display comprises a graphical user interface, and wherein the interaction between the user persona and the user occurs via the graphical user interface.
17. The method of claim 1, wherein the interaction between the user persona and the user comprises voice and audio interactions.
