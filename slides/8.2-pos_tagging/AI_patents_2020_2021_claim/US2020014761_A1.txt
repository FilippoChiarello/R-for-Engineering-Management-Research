SERVER DEVICE, LEARNED MODEL PROVIDING PROGRAM, LEARNED MODEL PROVIDING METHOD, AND LEARNED MODEL PROVIDING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A server device configured to communicate, via a communication network, with at least one device including a learner configured to perform processing by using a learned model, includes processor, a transmitter, and a storage configured to store a plurality of shared models pre-learned in accordance with environments and conditions of various devices. The processor is configured to acquire device data including information on an environment and conditions from the at least one device, and select an optimum shared model for the at least one device based on the acquired device data. The transmitter is configured to transmit a selected shared model to the at least one device.

<claims>
1. 1-12. (canceled)
13. A server comprising: at least one storage configured to store a plurality of shared models; and at least one processor configured to: acquire device data from a first device, the device data including information on the first device; select, from the plurality of shared models, a shared model based on the device data; and transmit the selected shared model to the first device.
14. The server according to claim 13, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to: perform additional learning on at least one of the plurality of shared models stored in the at least one storage using sample data; and cause the at least one storage to store an additional learned model based on the performed additional learning.
15. The server according to claim 14, wherein the sample data is acquired from a second device, and the at least one processor is further configured to transmit the additional learned model to the second device.
16. The server according to claim 13, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to: receive an additional learned model from a third device, the additional learned model being based on additional learning on at least one of the plurality of shared models; and cause the at least one storage to store the received additional learned model.
17. The server according to claim 13, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to generate a new model by using sample data acquired from a fourth device.
18. The server according to claim 13, wherein the device data includes information on at least one of an environment of the first device, a condition of the first device, an attribute of the first device, sample data with label information, sensor data, or network log data.
19. The server according to claim 13, wherein each of the plurality of shared models has a different characteristic based on environments or conditions of one or more devices.
20. A device comprising: at least one storage; and at least one processor configured to: transmit device data to at least one server, the device data including information on the device; receive a shared model from the at least one server, the shared model being selected by the at least one server based on the device data; and performing processing on data by using the received shared model.
21. The device according to claim 20, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to perform additional learning on the shared model by using sample data.
22. The device according to claim 21, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to transmit an additional learned model to the at least one server.
23. The device according to claim 20, wherein the device data includes information on at least one of an environment of the device, a condition of the device, an attribute of the device, sample data with label information, sensor data, or network log data.
24. A method executed by one or more servers, the method comprising: acquiring device data from a first device, the device data including information on the first device; selecting, from among a plurality of shared models, a shared model based on the device data; and transmitting the selected shared model to the first device.
25. The method according to claim 24, further comprising: performing additional learning on at least one of the plurality of shared models stored in one or more storages by using sample data; and causing the one or more storages to store an additional learned model.
26. The method according to claim 25, wherein the sample data is acquired from a second device, and the method further comprises: transmitting the additional learned model to the second device.
27. The model providing method according to claim 24, further comprising: receiving an additional learned model transmitted from a third device, the additional learned model being based on additional learning on one of the plurality of shared models; and causing one or more storages to store the received additional learned model.
28. The model providing method according to claim 24, further comprising: generating a new model by using sample data acquired from a fourth device.
29. The model providing method according to claim 24, wherein the device data includes information on at least one of an environment of the first device, a condition of the first device, an attribute of the first device, sample data with label information, sensor data, or network log data.
30. The model providing method according to claim 24, wherein each of the plurality of shared models has a different characteristic based on environments or conditions of one or more devices.
31. A method for acquiring models, comprising: transmitting, by a device, device data to one or more servers, the device data including information on the device; and receiving, by the device, a shared model from the one or more servers, the shared model being selected by the one or more servers based on the device data.
32. The model acquiring method according to claim 31, wherein the device data includes information on at least one of an environment of the device, a condition of the device, an attribute of the device, sample data with label information, sensor data, or network log data.
