Method And System For Analysis Of Spine Anatomy And Spine Disease
</title>

<abstract>
A method for analysis of spine anatomy and stenosis is disclosed herein. The method includes preprocessing (3203) of images and then running segmentation models for each area of interest such as the foramen, disc, canal, vertebra (3206). In image post processing (3207), the system runs various heuristics to ensure accuracy (3208), computes areas (3209), and then runs a comparison model (3210). The report template produces HTML that is then converted to a PDF file of the final report (3214).

<claims>
We claim as our invention the following:
1. A computer-implemented method for generating a diagnosis for a spinal disease, the method comprising: inputting a plurality of digital images of an axial plane of a patient's spine showing a plurality of successive points along a length of the spine; identifying a spinal canal or other spine anatomy in each image of the plurality of digital images; estimating a cross-sectional area of the spinal canal or spinal anatomy of interest in each image of the plurality of digital images; calculating a plurality of ratios by comparing the cross-sectional area in each image to the cross-sectional area in preceding images of the plurality of digital images; and generating a diagnosis for a spinal disease according to the plurality of ratios.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein a sagittal plane of a patient's spine is inputted and used to identify and measure cross-sectional areas.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the medical diagnosis comprises a rating for the severity of spinal stenosis or related conditions.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the diagnosis comprises a surgical evaluation or recommendation for surgical treatment of spinal stenosis or other spinal disease.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the diagnosis comprises a recommendation for physical therapy treatment.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the spinal anatomy is one of a spinal canal diameter, a spinal canal radius, or a spinal canal circumference.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising calculating a plurality of differences, calculated by subtracting the previous spinal canal area from the current spinal canal area.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein one or more cross-sectional areas are compared to a sample population to output a degree of difference.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein one or more cross-sectional areas are compared to a to those of a comparison group to form aspects of a diagnosis.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the comparison group is matched to the patient's demographics and health data.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein data relating to the formed medical diagnosis is sent to one or more external systems.
12. A non-transitory computer-readable medium that stores a program that causes a processor to perform functions to analyze a spine image by executing the following steps: inputting a plurality of digital images of an axial plane of a patient's spine showing a plurality of successive points along a length of the spine; identifying a spinal canal or other spine anatomy in each image of the plurality of digital images; estimating a cross-sectional area of the spinal canal or spinal anatomy of interest in each image of the plurality of digital images; calculating a plurality of ratios by comparing the cross-sectional area in each image to the cross-sectional area in preceding images of the plurality of digital images, or calculating a plurality of differences by subtracting a previous spinal canal area from a current spinal canal area; generating a diagnosis for a spinal disease according to the plurality of ratios or the plurality of differences.
13. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 12, wherein the diagnosis comprises a rating for the severity of spinal stenosis or related conditions.
14. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 12, wherein the diagnosis comprises a surgical evaluation or recommendation for surgical treatment of spinal stenosis or related conditions.
15. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 12, wherein the diagnosis comprises a recommendation for physical therapy treatment of spinal stenosis or related conditions.
16. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 12, wherein the spinal canal area is replaced with the spinal canal diameter, spinal canal radius, spinal canal circumference, or other measurement correlated to spinal canal area.
17. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 12, wherein the diagnosis is formed according to the plurality of ratios.
