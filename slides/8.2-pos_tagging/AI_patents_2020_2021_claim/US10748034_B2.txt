</abstract>

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for training a learning-based medical scanner, the method comprising: obtaining, by the medical scanner, medical imaging data for a plurality of medical procedures; obtaining, by an array of cameras with range sensing capabilities, a plurality of end-to-end scanning sequence data comprising scene geometry information relating to a scanner room environment during the respective plurality of medical procedures; obtaining feedback for each of the plurality of end-to-end scanning sequence data comprising feedback on image quality for the medical imaging data received from a doctor and feedback on a patient experience received from the patient; and learning the medical scanner's control policies using a deep reinforcement learning framework and input comprising the plurality of end-to-end scanning sequence data and respective feedback.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the end-to-end scanning sequence data comprising scene geometry information acquired using an array of sensors and patient information.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the patient information comprises patient schedule.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the patient information further comprises patient medical history, patient treatment information, and patient physical attributes.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the medical scanner's control policies include actions that can be performed by the medical scanner.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the medical scanner is a computed tomography (CT) scanner, positron emission tomography (PET) scanner, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanner, magnetic resonance (MR) scanner, or an X-ray scanner.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the end-to-end scanning sequence data comprises movements of a scanning table to an appropriate height and a positioning of the patient, scanning table, or patient and scanning table during a scan of an appropriate region of the patient.
8. A method for training a learning-based medical scanner, the method comprising: (a) generating a 3D representation of a scanner room scene in a coordinate system of the scanner; (b) modeling the medical scanner as a deep reinforcement learning agent; (c) obtaining a plurality of 3D end-to-end scanning sequences capturing entire scanning workflows including a patient body region that was scanned and a list of actions performed by the scanner; (d) converting each of the 3D end-to-end scanning sequences into 3D scene data; and (e) training the deep reinforcement learning agent of the medical scanner to learn control policies using the 3D scene data.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the 3D representation of the scanner room scene and the 3D scene data comprises a voxel representation, a point cloud representation, or a geometric primitive representation.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein step (e) comprises utilizing deep Q-learning network for variants of deep reinforcement learning framework to map the 3D scene data into the control policies.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein step (b) includes learning a model for each object in the scanner room scene using a deep reinforcement learning framework.
12. A method comprising: receiving 3D range data of a scanner environment acquired using an array of cameras with range sensing capabilities; parsing the 3D range data into a plurality of components of the scanner environment using a trained parsing framework to fit a 3D mesh model to each component of the plurality of components; obtaining a scene model of the scanner environment, where the scene model includes a 3D patient mesh model; obtaining feedback for scans acquired in the scanner environment; and training a deep learning agent to map the 3D patient mesh model, the 3D mesh model, the feedback, a body region to be scanned into control policies.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein parsing comprises training a parsing deep reinforcement learning framework to parse the 3D range data into the plurality of components.
