SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR GENERATING GAUSSIAN RANDOM NUMBERS WITH HARDWARE ACCELERATION
</title>

<abstract>
Described herein are hardware acceleration of random number generation for machine learning and deep learning applications. An apparatus (700) includes a uniform random number generator (URNG) circuit (710) to generate uniform random numbers and an adder circuit (750) that is coupled to the URNG circuit (710). The adder circuit hardware (750) accelerates generation of Gaussian random numbers for machine learning.
