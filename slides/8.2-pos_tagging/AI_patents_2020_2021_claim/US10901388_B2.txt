Method and system for creating energy demand model
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to a method for generating an energy demand model by a multi-access edge server, the method including: a step a of receiving a task execution request signal including a bit value from a user; a step b of matching a task to one or more pre-classified groups using the bit value; a step c of extracting a feature of energy consumed to perform the task according to a criterion set differently for each group; a step of performing the steps a to c for one or more task execution request signals received from one or more users during a time period and generating an energy demand pattern for the time period using a feature of energy for one or more tasks performed during the time period; and a step of generating an energy demand model by time using one or more energy demand patterns by time and energy cost by time.

2. The method of claim 1, wherein the groups comprise a first group comprising a task that cannot be suspended and postponed, a second group comprising a task that cannot be suspended but does not necessarily require real-time processing, and a third group comprising a task that can be suspended and does not require an always-on power supply.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein a total energy consumption for one or more tasks matched to the first group during the time period is calculated using a number of access edge servers and an energy consumption for each task matched to the first group during the time period.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein a total energy consumption for one or more tasks matched to the second group during the time period is calculated using a number of tasks requested to be performed, an energy coefficient corresponding to a capacity of an access edge server, a total required calculation amount for one access edge server during the time period, and a calculation capacity of the access edge server.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein a total energy consumption for one or more tasks matched to the third group during the time period is calculated using a number of access edge servers, an energy consumption for each task matched to the third group during the time period, and a variable having a binary value.
