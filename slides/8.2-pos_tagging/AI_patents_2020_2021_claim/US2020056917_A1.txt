<title>
Leaky Lamb Wave Flowmeter
</title>

<abstract>
Propagation of leaky Lamb waves in pipe walls is used to provide a clamp-on acoustic flow meter for single-phase fluid flow in pipes. The received acoustic signals can be analyzed analytically, or by matching to numerical models, or with machine learning. In a preferred embodiment, variation of penetration depth of the leaky Lamb waves into the fluid flow with frequency provides an approach for measuring flow rate vs. radius with a clamp-on flow meter.

<claims>
1. A method for measuring fluid flow rate in a pipe, the method comprising: providing a pipe having a single-phase fluid flow within it; disposing at least two axially separated acoustic transducers on an outside surface of the pipe; exciting one or more leaky Lamb waves in a wall of the pipe with one or more of the acoustic transducers, wherein each leaky Lamb wave has a corresponding leak rate of energy loss to the single-phase fluid flow, wherein the leak rates of the Lamb waves depend on flow parameters of the fluid within the pipe; receiving the one or more leaky Lamb waves with one or more of the acoustic transducers to provide received acoustic signals; measuring the leak rates of the leaky Lamb waves from the received acoustic signals; and determining at least a fluid flow rate in the pipe by collective analysis of the measured leak rates.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the fluid flow is a gas flow.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the fluid flow is a liquid flow.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least two axially separated acoustic transducers are selected from the group consisting of: piezoelectric transducers, electromagnetic acoustic transducers, capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers, and piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the two or more leaky Lamb waves have different penetration depths into the single-phase fluid flow, whereby a fluid flow rate profile vs. radius can be determined.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the collective analysis is performed using machine learning that has been trained on a set of reference data.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the collective analysis is performed analytically or with a computer implemented numerical model.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising performing phase change measurements of the leaky Lamb waves, and wherein the collective analysis includes determining flow rate from both the measured leak rates and the phase change measurements.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein a selected two or more of the axially separated acoustic transducers operate as both transmitters and receivers during data collection, whereby bi-directional leak rate data is provided.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the selected two or more of the axially separated acoustic transducers operate as both transmitters and receivers simultaneously, whereby standing waves are generated in a wall of the pipe between the selected two or more of the axially separated acoustic transducers.
11. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining one or more fluid parameters selected from the group consisting of: pressure, temperature, composition, and bubble content.
