METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR OBSTACLE DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
A method for ranking a driver of a vehicle. The method may include sensing, by at least one sensor, an environment of the vehicle to provide sensed data; determining (a) a vehicle behavior of the vehicle that is driven by the driver, and (b) based on the sensed data, an expected vehicle behavior; matching the vehicle behavior to the expected vehicle behavior to provide a match result; transmitting the match result, storing the match result, or calculating a score of the driver; and wherein the calculating of the score of the driver comprises deciding whether to update a score of the driver based on the match result; and according to the deciding, updating the score of the driver.

<claims>
1. A method for ranking a driver of a vehicle, the method comprises: sensing, by at least one sensor, an environment of the vehicle to provide sensed data; determining (a) a vehicle behavior of the vehicle that is driven by the driver, and (b) based on the sensed data, an expected vehicle behavior; matching the vehicle behavior to the expected vehicle behavior to provide a match result; and transmitting the match result, storing the match result, or calculating a score of the driver; and wherein the calculating of the score of the driver comprises deciding whether to update a score of the driver based on the match result; and according to the deciding, updating the score of the driver.
2. The method according to claim 1 wherein the at least one sensor belongs to the vehicle.
3. The method according to claim 1 wherein the determining of the vehicle behavior is based, at least in part, on the sensed data.
4. The method according to claim 1 wherein the determining comprises loading expected vehicle behavior information from an expected behavior database.
5. The method according to claim 1 comprising analyzing the sensed data to locate one or more traffic law reference points, and wherein the determining is based on an absence or presence of the one or more traffic law reference points.
6. The method according to claim 5 wherein the determining comprises accessing an expected behavior database that stores a mapping between traffic law reference points and expected vehicle behaviors.
7. The method according to claim 1 comprising updating the score of the driver only when at least a predefined amount of scores of the driver exist.
8. The method according to claim 1 wherein the deciding comprises updating the score of the driver whenever there is a match result.
9. The method according to claim 1 comprising triggering the determining per each predefined time segment.
10. The method according to claim 1 comprising triggering the determining per each predefined distance passed by the vehicle.
11. The method according to claim 1 comprising determining a frequency of repetition of the triggering of the determining based on a current score of the driver.
12. The method according to claim 1 wherein the at least one sensor comprises a visual sensor.
13. The method according to claim 1 wherein the at least one sensor comprises an accelerator and a speed meter.
14. The method according to claim 1 comprising generating an alert when there is a significant mismatch between the vehicle behavior the expected vehicle behavior.
15. The method according to claim 1 comprising generating an alert when there is a significant change the score of the driver.
16. The method according to claim 1 comprising generating an alert when the score of the driver is below a predefined threshold.
17. A non-transitory computer readable medium that stores instructions for: sensing, by at least one sensor, an environment of the vehicle to provide sensed data; determining (a) a vehicle behavior of the vehicle that is driven by the driver, and (b) based on the sensed data, an expected vehicle behavior; matching the vehicle behavior to the expected vehicle behavior to provide a match result; and transmitting the match result, storing the match result, or calculating a score of the driver; and wherein the calculating of the score of the driver comprises deciding whether to update a score of the driver based on the match result; and according to the deciding, updating the score of the driver.
18. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 152 wherein the at least one sensor belongs to the vehicle.
19. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 152 wherein the determining of the vehicle behavior is based, at least in part, on the sensed data.
20. A computerized system that comprises: at least one sensor for sensing an environment of the vehicle to provide sensed data; and a processing circuit that is configured to: determine (a) a vehicle behavior of the vehicle that is driven by the driver, and (b) based on the sensed data, an expected vehicle behavior; match the vehicle behavior to the expected vehicle behavior to provide a match result; and transmit the match result, storing the match result, or calculating a score of the driver; and wherein the calculating of the score of the driver comprises deciding whether to update a score of the driver based on the match result; and according to the deciding, updating the score of the driver.
