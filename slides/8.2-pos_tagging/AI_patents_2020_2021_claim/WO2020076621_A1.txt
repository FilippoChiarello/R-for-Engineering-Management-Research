</title>

<abstract>
Provided herein are system, apparatus, device, method and/or computer program product embodiments, and/or combinations and sub-combinations thereof, for identifying second products in an inventory of a second ecommerce site that are at least similar to a first product currently being displayed to an user by a first ecommerce site, and displaying the second products for viewing and purchase by the user at the first ecommerce site.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for identifying second products in an inventory of a second ecommerce site that are at least similar to a first product currently being displayed to an user by a first ecommerce site, and displaying the second products for viewing and purchase by the user at the first ecommerce site, the method operating in the second ecommerce site and comprising:
receiving product information pertaining to the first product;
cleaning and weighing the product information to generate search parameters; searching the inventory using the search parameters to identify the second products;
ordering a listing of the second products such that it is more likely that the second products appearing first in the listing are (1) most similar to the first product, and (2) of most interest to the user; and
transmitting the listing to a plug-in application, wherein the plug-in application operates with a browser that is being used to display the first ecommerce site, to display the listing to the user.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein cleaning and weighing comprises:
identifying a category of the first product based on identifying, in the product information, keywords associated with the category;
identifying, in the product information, characteristics associated with the category; and
applying weights to the characteristics, wherein the weighted characteristics constitute the search parameters.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the category, the characteristics and the weights were determined based on monitoring and analyzing activity of users while interacting with the second ecommerce site.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the ordering comprises ordering the listing based on the weighted characteristics.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein the characteristics of the category comprise the keywords of the category.
6. A backend server supporting a second ecommerce site that executes on one or more
second computing devices, comprising:
an inventory database;
a category database; and
one or more processors configured to:
receive product information pertaining to a first product being offered by a first ecommerce site, wherein an user is browsing the first ecommerce site at a first computing device, wherein a plug-in application executes in the first ecommerce site;
clean and weigh the product information to generate search parameters; search the inventory database using the search parameters to identify second products that are at least similar to the first product;
order a listing of the second products such that it is more likely that the second products appearing first in the listing are (1) most similar to the first product, and (2) of most interest to the user; and
transmit the listing to the plug-in application, wherein the plug-in application operates to display the listing to the user.
7. The backend server of claim 6, wherein to clean and weigh, the one or more processors are further configured to:
identify a category of the first product based on identifying, in the product information, keywords associated with the category;
identify, in the product information, characteristics associated with the category; and
apply weights to the characteristics, wherein the weighted characteristics constitute the search parameters.
8. The backend server of claim 7, wherein the category, the characteristics and the weights were determined based on monitoring and analyzing activity of users while interacting with the second ecommerce site.
9. The backend server of claim 8, wherein to order, the one or more processors are further configured to order the listing based on the weighted characteristics.
10. The backend server of claim 7, wherein the characteristics of the category comprise the keywords of the category.
11. A tangible computer-readable device having instructions stored thereon that, when
executed by at least one computing device, cause the at least one computing device to perform operations for identifying second products in an inventory of a second ecommerce site that are at least similar to a first product currently being displayed to an user by a first ecommerce site, and displaying the second products for viewing and purchase by the user at the first ecommerce site, the operations comprising:
receiving product information pertaining to the first product;
cleaning and weighing the product information to generate search parameters; searching the inventory using the search parameters to identify the second products;
ordering a listing of the second products such that it is more likely that the second products appearing first in the listing are (1) most similar to the first product, and (2) of most interest to the user; and
transmitting the listing to a plug-in application, wherein the plug-in application operates with a browser that is being used to display the first ecommerce site, to display the listing to the user.
12. The tangible computer-readable device of claim 11, wherein cleaning and weighing comprises:
identifying a category of the first product based on identifying, in the product information, keywords associated with the category; identifying, in the product information, characteristics associated with the category; and
applying weights to the characteristics, wherein the weighted characteristics constitute the search parameters.
13. The tangible computer-readable device of claim 12, wherein the category, the
characteristics and the weights were determined based on monitoring and analyzing activity of users while interacting with the second ecommerce site.
14. The tangible computer-readable device of claim 13, wherein the ordering comprises ordering the listing based on the weighted characteristics.
15. The tangible computer-readable device of claim 12, wherein the characteristics of the category comprise the keywords of the category.
