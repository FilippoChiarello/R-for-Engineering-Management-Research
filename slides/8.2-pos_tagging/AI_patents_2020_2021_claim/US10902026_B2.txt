<title>
Block classified term
</title>

<abstract>
A class may be determined of a term from a database. The term may be blocked from being presented to a user, if the determined class does not include a permission for the user to view the term. The term may suggest a remainder of an incomplete query input by the user.
</abstract>

<claims>
We claim:
1. A device, comprising: a processor; and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium on which is stored instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to: determine a class of a term received from a database based on a rule and/or machine learning, wherein the rule is used to match the term to a template and/or a pattern; perform an arithmetic operation on the term, wherein the arithmetic operation is a checksum or a multiplication of a plurality of digits included in the term; determine the class of the term based on a result of the arithmetic operation satisfying the rule, wherein the term is to suggest a remainder of an incomplete query; and block the term from being presented to a user based on the determined class of the term not providing a permission for the user to view the term, or allow the term to be presented based on the class of the term providing the permission for the user to view the term.
2. The device of claim 1, wherein the instructions cause the processor to: classify the term based on the machine learning, and the machine learning includes a grammar induction and/or a probabilistic classifier.
3. The device of claim 2, wherein, the probabilistic classifier includes a Bayesian classifier; and the grammar induction includes an inference by trial-and-error, a genetic algorithm, a greedy algorithm, a distributional learning algorithm, and/or a pattern learning algorithm.
4. The device of claim 1, wherein the instructions cause the processor to: classify the term based on the rule, wherein the rule indicates an operation to be performed on a number, letters, and/or a syntax of the term.
5. The device of claim 1, wherein different types of users correspond to different types of classes.
6. The device of claim 5, wherein the instructions cause the processor to: determine a plurality of the different types of classes based on a plurality of terms included in the database, wherein the plurality of terms included in the database are mined from data indexed into a search engine.
7. The device of claim 6, wherein, the plurality of the different types of classes relate to different security clearances, and one of the plurality of the different types of classes is a subset of another of the plurality of the different types of classes.
8. The device of claim 1, wherein, the term includes a name, an address, and/or a social security number, and the class of the term indicates sensitive and/or personally identifiable information when the class of the term does not include the permission for the user to view the term.
9. The device of claim 1, wherein the instructions cause the processor to: determine a plurality of classes of terms simultaneously, and block and/or allow a plurality of terms simultaneously.
10. The device of claim 1, wherein the instructions cause the processor to: classify the class of the term as a date based on a comparison of a range and/or a syntax of the term to the template and/or the pattern.
11. A method, comprising: receiving a term from a database related to part of a query of a user, the term to suggest a remainder of the query; classifying the term based on a rule and/or machine learning; performing an arithmetic operation on the term, wherein the arithmetic operation is a checksum or a multiplication of a plurality of digits included in the term; determining the class of the term based on a result of the arithmetic operation satisfying the rule; blocking the term from being suggested based on the class of the term not providing a permission to the user to view the term; or allowing the term to be suggested based on the class of the term providing the permission to the user to view the term.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein, the machine learning includes a grammar induction and/or a probabilistic classifier to classify the term, and the rule is to match the term to a template and/or a pattern to classify the term.
13. The method of claim 11, further comprising: determining a plurality of classes of terms simultaneously; and blocking and/or allowing a plurality of terms simultaneously.
14. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor of a device, cause the processor to: analyze terms received from a database to determine a plurality of classes of the terms, the terms relating to a part of a query and to suggest a remainder of the query; perform an arithmetic operation on the terms, the arithmetic operation being a checksum or a multiplication of a plurality of digits included in the terms; determine the plurality of classes of the terms based on a result of the arithmetic operation satisfying a rule; and determine whether a plurality of the terms are to be blocked and/or allowed in response to the query based on the plurality of classes of the terms.
15. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 14, wherein the instructions cause the processor to: block the plurality of the terms from being presented based on a user not having a permission to the plurality of classes of the terms, and allow the plurality of the terms to be presented, based on the user having the permission to the plurality of classes of the terms.
16. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 14, wherein the instructions cause the processor to: match the terms to a template and/or a pattern based on the rule.
17. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 14, wherein the instructions cause the processor to: determine the plurality of classes of the terms simultaneously, and block and/or allow the plurality of the terms simultaneously.
18. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 14, wherein the instructions cause the processor to: determine the plurality of classes of the terms based on the rule and machine learning.
