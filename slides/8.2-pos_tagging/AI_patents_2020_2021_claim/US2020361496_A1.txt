VEHICLE CONTROL SYSTEM, VEHICLE CONTROL METHOD, AND STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle control system includes a recognizer that recognizes a surrounding environment of a vehicle, and a driving controller that performs speed control and steering control of the vehicle based on a recognition result of the recognizer. When moving the vehicle to a parking area after detecting that an occupant gets off the vehicle at a stop position, the driving controller adjusts a start timing for starting the vehicle based on the number of vehicles stopped at the stop position recognized by the recognizer.

<claims>
1. A vehicle control system comprising: a recognizer configured to recognize a surrounding environment of a vehicle; and a driving controller configured to perform speed control and steering control of the vehicle based on a recognition result of the recognizer, wherein, when moving the vehicle to a parking area after detecting that an occupant has got out of the vehicle at a stop position, the driving controller adjusts a start timing for starting the vehicle based on the number of vehicles stopped at the stop position recognized by the recognizer.
2. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein, when it is recognized by the recognizer that the number of vehicles is smaller than a reference, the driving controller delays the start timing, as compared to a case where it is recognized that the number of vehicles is larger than the reference.
3. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein the recognizer has a function of recognizing a forgotten item in an interior of the vehicle, and when it is recognized by the recognizer that the number of vehicles is small, the driving controller starts the vehicle after confirming that no forgotten items have been recognized by the recognizer.
4. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, wherein, when it is recognized by the recognizer that the number of vehicles is smaller than the reference, the driving controller delays the start timing by a predetermined time, as compared to a case where it is recognized that the number of vehicles is larger than the reference.
5. The vehicle control system according to claim 1, further comprising: a notifier that notifies the occupant of the vehicle of various types of information, wherein, when it is recognized by the recognizer that the number of vehicles at the stop position is smaller than the reference, the notifier notifies a larger number of confirmation items related to an action of the occupant, as compared to a case where it is recognized that the number of vehicles is larger than the reference.
6. The vehicle control system according to claim 5, wherein, when it is recognized by the recognizer that the number of vehicles is large, the driving controller starts the vehicle while the notification of the confirmation items is being made by the notifier, and when it is recognized by the recognizer that the number of vehicles is small, the driving controller starts the vehicle after the notification by the notifier is completed.
7. The vehicle control system according to claim 6, wherein, when starting the vehicle while the notification of the confirmation items is being made by the notifier, the driving controller allows the vehicle to travel a speed lower than a predetermined speed.
8. A vehicle control method implemented by a computer performing the steps of: recognizing a surrounding environment of a vehicle; performing speed control and steering control of the vehicle based on a recognition result; and adjusting, when moving the vehicle to a parking area after detecting that an occupant gets off the vehicle at a stop position, a start timing for starting the vehicle based on the number of vehicles stopped at the recognized stop position.
9. A computer readable non-transitory storing medium storing a program causing a computer to perform the steps of: recognizing a surrounding environment of a vehicle; performing speed control and steering control of the vehicle based on a recognition result; and adjusting, when moving the vehicle to a parking area after detecting that an occupant gets off the vehicle at a stop position, a start timing for starting the vehicle based on the number of vehicles stopped at the recognized stop position.
