Shared neoantigens
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein in one aspect is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a plurality of neoantigenic peptides and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, each neoantigenic peptide comprising a tumor-specific neoepitope capable of binding to an HLA protein in a subject, each tumor-specific neoepitope comprising a tumor-specific mutation present in a tumor, wherein (a) the composition comprises neoantigenic peptides comprising tumor-specific mutations present in at least 1% of subjects in a population of subjects suffering from cancer; (b) the composition comprises neoantigenic peptides comprising tumor-specific neoepitopes which bind to HLA proteins present in at least 5% of subjects in the population; and (c) the composition comprises at least one neoantigenic peptide capable of eliciting an immune response against a tumor present in at least 5% of the subjects in the population of subjects suffering from cancer.

<claims>
1. A method of treating cancer in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising: (i) a polypeptide comprising at least one amino acid sequence comprising at least 8 contiguous amino acids of: PPLQHGHRHGLEPCSMLTGPPARVPAVPFDLHFCRSSIMKPKRDGYMFLKAES KIMFATLQRSSLWCLCSNH (residues 26-97 of SEQ ID NO: 1297); or (ii) a nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

8. The method of claim 7, wherein the pharmaceutical composition further comprises an immunomodulator or adjuvant.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the immunomodulator or adjuvant is poly(I:C).
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising administering an additional cancer therapy to the subject.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the additional therapy is a checkpoint inhibitor; or wherein the additional therapy is surgery, chemotherapy, a targeted therapy, or a combination thereof.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the cancer is breast cancer.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject has a GATA3 frameshift mutation.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the GATA3 frameshift mutation is a GATA3:p.H434 frameshift mutation.
15. The method of claim 12, wherein the breast cancer is non-metastatic breast cancer.
16. The method of claim 12, wherein the breast cancer is metastatic breast cancer.
