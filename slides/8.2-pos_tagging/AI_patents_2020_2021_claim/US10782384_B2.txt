<title>
Localization methods and systems for autonomous systems
</title>

<abstract>
A localization system uses an auction-based cooperative localization method to determine local pose estimations or local pose state corrections. The auction-based cooperative localization method is triggered by receipt of relative position measurements by a member of a cooperative and is cooperatively processed by a bid winning member of the cooperative, where the cooperative refers to a collection of autonomous vehicles and passengers with location/position determinable devices that are in communication with each other for the purposes of sharing localization data, position data and the like. The bid winning member determines local pose estimations or local pose state corrections for itself and provides local pose estimations or local pose state corrections to the other members of the cooperative.

<claims>
1. A method for localization, the method comprising: receiving, by a rover cooperative from an auctioneer, a local pose estimation task to determine position and orientation estimations for each member of the rover cooperative, wherein the rover cooperative includes a plurality of rovers and wherein each rover is one of autonomous vehicles and passengers with location/position determinable devices which are in communication for the purposes of sharing data to perform the local pose estimation task, and the auctioneer is one of the plurality of rovers; receiving, by the auctioneer from each rover of the rover cooperative matching required computation and communication capabilities to perform the local pose estimation task bid; selecting, by the auctioneer, a winning rover bidder; performing, by the winning rover bidder, the local pose estimation task using at least the shared data; sending, by the winning rover bidder to an autonomous vehicle controller for the winner rover bidder, information based on the performed local pose estimation task or an update command, and sending, by the winning rover bidder to the plurality of rovers in the rover cooperative, information based on the performed local pose estimation task or an update command.
2. The method of claim 1, the method further comprising: selecting the auctioneer from the rover cooperative by using at least one of random selection or rotation among the plurality of rovers in the rover cooperative.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the local pose estimation task is triggered by the availability of relative measurements.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein local pose estimation task includes at least relative measurements, wherein the at least relative measurements are non-radio-navigation-satellite services (RNSS) systems measurements.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the local pose estimate task includes the required computation and communication capabilities to perform the local pose estimation task bid.
6. The method of claim 1, the method further comprising: determining the viability of the auctioneer based on communication loss; and selecting another auctioneer on a condition of auctioneer death.
7. A localization system comprising: a rover cooperative including a plurality of rovers which are in communication for the purposes of sharing data to determine localization for each member of the rover cooperative, and wherein a rover is one of an autonomous vehicle (AV) and a passenger; an auctioneer, wherein the auctioneer is one of the plurality of rovers, the auctioneer configured to: announce a local pose estimation task to the rover cooperative; receive local pose estimation task bids from rovers of the rover cooperative meeting computation and communication capabilities required to perform the local posee estimation task; and select a winning rover bidder; and the winning rover bidder is configured to: perform the local pose estimation task to determine position and orientation; update an AV controller with information based on the performed local pose estimation or update command, and update the plurality of rovers in the rover cooperative with their local pose estimation or an update command.
8. The localization system of claim 7, wherein selection of the auctioneer is done by using at least one of random selection or rotation among the plurality rovers in the rover cooperative.
9. The localization system of claim 7, wherein the local pose estimation task is triggered by the availability of relative measurements.
10. The localization system of claim 7, wherein the auctioneer's announcement includes at least relative measurements, wherein the at least relative measurements are non-radio-navigation-satellite services (RNSS) systems measurements.
11. The localization system of claim 7, wherein auctioneer viability is based on communication loss and another auctioneer is selected on a condition of auctioneer death.
12. A method for localization, the method comprising: selecting an auctioneer from a rover cooperative, wherein the rover cooperative includes rovers and wherein each rover is one of autonomous vehicles and passengers with location/position determinable devices which are in communication for the purposes of sharing data to determine position and orientation estimations for each member of the rover cooperative; announcing by the auctioneer a local pose estimation task to the rover cooperative; submitting local pose estimation task bids to the auctioneer by rovers meeting computation and communication capabilities to perform the local pose estimation task; selecting a winning rover bidder by the auctioneer; monitoring the progress of the winning rover bidder by the auctioneer; performing, by the winning rover, the local pose estimation task to determine position and orientation of each of the rovers in the rover cooperative; and updating, by the winning rover, the rovers in the rover cooperative with the rovers's determined local pose estimation or a rover specific local pose state correction.
13. The method of claim 12, the method further comprising: selecting the auctioneer by using at least one of random selection or rotation among the rovers in the rover cooperative.
14. The method of claim 12, wherein a local pose estimation task is triggered by the availability of relative measurements.
15. The method of claim 12, wherein the local pose estimation task includes at least relative measurements, wherein the at least relative measurements are non-radio-navigation-satellite services (RNSS) systems measurements.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the relative measurements include at least signals of opportunity measurements.
17. The method of claim 12, the method further comprising: determining the viability of the auctioneer based on communication loss.
18. The method of claim 17, the method further comprising: selecting another auctioneer on a condition of auctioneer death.
