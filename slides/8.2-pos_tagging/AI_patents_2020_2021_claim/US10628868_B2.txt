<abstract>
An enterprise geospatial intelligence service oriented architecture (EGI-SOA) provides a consumer with one or more tailored products in response to either a dynamic request or a standing request by the consumer.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising the following steps: (a) autonomously tailoring one or more tailored geospatial intelligence products by executing an ExecML job in a computing cloud in response to a consumer request for the one or more tailored geospatial intelligence products; (b) providing the one or more tailored geospatial intelligence products to the consumer, wherein a respective CSD server runs on each respective processor in the computing cloud, and wherein each CSD server generates a CSD file representing a contextual state for each respective processor at a given time; (c) aggregating the CSD files for all of the processors of the computing cloud to form an aggregated list of CSD files; (d) determining an optimal configuration of the computing resources within the computing cloud that are needed to execute the ExecML job; and (e) executing the ExecML job using the optimal configuration, wherein step (d) is based on the aggregated list of CSD files.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein step (a) comprises: (f) filtering an event cloud to match one or more events in the event cloud to an event pattern; (g) extracting contexts for each event matched in step (f); (h) translating a workflow with the contexts into an executable process.
3. A method comprising the following steps: (a) autonomously tailoring one or more tailored geospatial intelligence products by executing an ExecML job in a computing cloud in response to a consumer request for the one or more tailored geospatial intelligence products; (b) providing the one or more tailored geospatial intelligence products to the consumer, wherein a respective CSD server runs on each respective processor in the computing cloud, and wherein each CSD server generates a CSD file representing a contextual state for each respective processor at a given time; (c) aggregating the CSD files for all of the processors of the computing cloud to form an aggregated list of CSD files; (d) determining that an optimal configuration of the computing resources within the computing cloud for executing the ExecML job does not exist; (e) dynamically re-provisioning some of the computing cloud resources to form a re-provisioned configuration of the computing resources within the computing cloud; and (f) executing the ExecML job using the re-provisioned configuration, wherein steps (d) and (e) are based on the aggregated list of CSD files.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein step (a) comprises: (g) filtering an event cloud to match one or more events in the event cloud to an event pattern; (h) extracting contexts for each event matched in step (g); (i) translating a workflow with the contexts into an executable process.
5. A method comprising the following steps: (a) autonomously tailoring one or more tailored geospatial intelligence products by executing an ExecML job in a computing cloud in response to a consumer request for the one or more tailored geospatial intelligence products; (b) providing the one or more tailored geospatial intelligence products to the consumer, wherein a respective CSD server runs on each respective processor in the computing cloud, and wherein each CSD server generates a CSD file representing a contextual state for each respective processor at a given time; (c) aggregating the CSD files for all of the processors of the computing cloud to form an aggregated list of CSD files; (d) determining that an optimal configuration of the computing resources within the computing cloud for executing the ExecML job does not exist; (e) determining that a less optimal configuration of the computing resources within the computing cloud that can execute the ExecML; and (f) executing the ExecML job using the less optimal configuration, wherein steps (d) and (e) are based on the aggregated list of CSD files.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein step (a) comprises: (g) filtering an event cloud to match one or more events in the event cloud to an event pattern; (h) extracting contexts for each event matched in step (g); (i) translating a workflow with the contexts into an executable process.
7. A method comprising the following steps: (a) autonomously tailoring one or more tailored geospatial intelligence products by executing an ExecML job in a computing cloud in response to a consumer request for the one or more tailored geospatial intelligence products; (b) providing the one or more tailored geospatial intelligence products to the consumer, wherein a respective CSD server runs on each respective processor in the computing cloud, and wherein each CSD server generates a CSD file representing a contextual state for each respective processor at a given time; (c) aggregating the CSD files for all of the processors of the computing cloud to form an aggregated list of CSD files; (d) determining that an optimal configuration of the computing resources within the computing cloud for executing the ExecML job does not exist; (e) determining that a less optimal configuration of the computing resources within the computing cloud that can execute the ExecML cannot fulfill all of the conditions of a service level agreement; and (f) executing the ExecML job using the less optimal configuration, wherein steps (d) and (e) are based on the aggregated list of CSD files.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein step (a) comprises: (g) filtering an event cloud to match one or more events in the event cloud to an event pattern; (h) extracting contexts for each event matched in step (f); (i) translating a workflow with the contexts into an executable process.
9. A machine readable medium having stored thereon sequences of instructions, which when executed by one or more processors, cause one or more electronic devices to perform a set of operations comprising the following steps: (a) autonomously tailoring one or more tailored geospatial intelligence products by executing an ExecML job in a computing cloud in response to a consumer request for the one or more tailored geospatial intelligence products; (b) providing the one or more tailored products to the consumer, wherein a respective CSD server runs on each respective processor in the computing cloud, and wherein each CSD server generates a CSD file representing a contextual state for each respective processor at a given time; (c) aggregating the CSD files for all of the processors of the computing cloud to form an aggregated list of CSD files; (d) determining an optimal configuration of the computing resources within the computing cloud that are needed to execute the ExecML job; and (e) executing the ExecML job using the optimal configuration, wherein step (d) is based on the aggregated list of CSD files.
10. The machine readable medium of claim 9, wherein step (a) comprises: (f) filtering an event cloud to match one or more events in the event cloud to an event pattern; (g) extracting contexts for each event matched in step (f); (h) translating a workflow with the contexts into an executable process.
