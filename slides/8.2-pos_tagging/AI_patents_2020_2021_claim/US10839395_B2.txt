Techniques for expediting processing of blockchain transactions
</title>

<abstract>
Technology is disclosed herein for expediting blockchain transactions. More specifically, the technology describes techniques for assessing risk associated with expediting processing of blockchain transactions received by a transaction processing platform. When a determination is made that a transaction can be expedited, the transaction processing platform can expedite the transaction, e.g., locally process the blockchain transaction, prior to receiving a verification or confirmation from the consensus network. In this manner, the transaction processing platform can act like a local cache allowing quick access and operation on permanently stored data within the blockchain with minimal or calculated risk.
