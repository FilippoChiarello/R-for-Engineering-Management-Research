<title>
Apparatus and methods for cellular compositions
</title>

<abstract>
Broadly speaking, embodiments of the present invention provide systems, methods and apparatus for cellular compositions/generating music in real-time using cells (i.e. short musical motifs), where the cellular compositions are dependent on user data.

<claims>
1. A cellular composition method comprising: receiving, at a first apparatus, a request for a cellular composition; receiving, at the first apparatus, user data; and transmitting, from the first apparatus to a second apparatus, a control signal comprising the request and user data; receiving, at the second apparatus, from the first apparatus, the control signal; filtering, at the second apparatus responsive to the received user data, at least one dataset containing a plurality of modules, each module comprising a plurality of cells; selecting, at the second apparatus, at least one cell from the filtered at least one dataset; arranging, at the second apparatus responsive to the control signal, the at least one cell according to a pathway; receiving, at the first apparatus, at least one change in user data; determining, at the first apparatus, for each change in user data, a change type and a change magnitude; generating, at the first apparatus, a modified control signal comprising each determined change type and change magnitude; transmitting, from the first apparatus to the second apparatus, the modified control signal; receiving, at the second apparatus from the first apparatus, the modified control signal; identifying, at the second apparatus, at least one transition rule corresponding to each determined change type and change magnitude; and applying, at the second apparatus, the at least one transition rule to the cellular composition.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein selecting at least one cell comprises selecting, at the second apparatus, a first cell from a first filtered dataset and a second cell from a second filtered dataset based on properties of the first cell, the method further comprising: at the second apparatus: arranging the first cell according to a first pathway; arranging the second cell according to a second pathway; and wherein the first pathway and second pathway at least partly overlap.
3. The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein applying the at least one transition rule comprises: identifying a cell in the cellular composition to be replaced; determining properties of the identified cell; selecting, based on the transition rule and the determined properties of the cell, a new cell from within the at least one dataset; and replacing the identified cell in the cellular composition with the selected new cell.
4. A system for cellular compositions, the system comprising: a first apparatus for: receiving a request for a cellular composition; receiving user data; generating a control signal comprising the request and user data; transmitting, to a second apparatus, the control signal; receiving at least one change in user data; determining for each change in user data, a change type and a change magnitude; generating a modified control signal comprising each determined change type and change magnitude; transmitting, to the second apparatus, the modified control signal; and a second apparatus for: receiving, from the first apparatus, the control signal; filtering, responsive to the received user data, at least one dataset containing a plurality of modules, each module comprising a plurality of cells; selecting at least one cell from the filtered at least one dataset; arranging, responsive to the control signal, the at least one cell according to a pathway; receiving the modified control signal; identifying at least one transition rule corresponding to each determined change type and change magnitude; and applying the at least one transition rule to the cellular composition.
