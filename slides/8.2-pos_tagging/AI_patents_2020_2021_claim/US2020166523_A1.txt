<title>
Cardiovascular Risk Event Prediction and Uses Thereof
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure includes biomarkers, methods, devices, reagents, systems, and kits for the evaluation of risk of a caradiovascular (CV) Event within 5 years. In one aspect, the disclosure provides biomarkers that can be used alone or in various combinations to evaluate risk of a CV event within 5 years. In another aspect, methods are provided for evaluating risk of a CV event within 5 years in an individual, where the methods include detecting, in a biological sample from an individual, at least one biomarker value corresponding to at least one biomarker selected from the group of biomarkers provided in Table 1. In a further aspect, methods are provided for evaluating the risk of a CV, where the methods include detecting, in a biological sample from an individual, at least one biomarker value corresponding to at least one biomarker selected from the group of biomarkers provided in Table 2. In a further aspect, methods are provided for evaluating the risk of a CV event in an individual, generally within 5 years, where the methods include detecting, in a biological sample from an individual, at least one biomarker value corresponding to at least one biomarker selected from the group of biomarkers provided in Table 3.

<claims>
1. A method comprising the following steps: a) contacting a biological sample from a subject with a set of aptamers comprising a 5-position pyrimidine modification, further wherein the 5-position pyrimidine modification comprises a substitution with a hydrophobic chemical group selected from the group consisting of benzyl, indole and naphthyl, further wherein each aptamer specifically binds to a different protein of the set of proteins comprising at least urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor (suPAR), Growth-differentiation factor 11 (GDF-11), Spondin-1, and Matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP-12); b) measuring the level of each of the different proteins in the biological sample from the subject based on measurement of the aptamers; c) determining a predictive score based on the measured levels of each of the different proteins; d) determining a risk level of the subject for having a cardiovascular event based on the predictive score, wherein the cardiovascular event is selected from the group consisting of myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), acute coronary artery syndrome, and congestive heart failure; and e) selecting a treatment, behavior or lifestyle change for the subject based on the risk level.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the treatment is a drug.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the behavior or lifestyle change is selected from the group consisting of a nutritional program, diet modification, lifestyle modification, exercise and smoking cessation program.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein measurement of the protein levels comprises performing an in vitro assay.
5. A computer-implemented method for retrieving protein levels measured in a biological sample from a human the method comprising: inputting into a computer measurements of protein levels from a biological sample from a human, wherein the protein levels comprise the measured protein levels of a set of proteins comprising at least urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor (suPAR), Growth-differentiation factor 11 (GDF-11), Spondin-1, and Matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP-12); and retrieving the measured protein levels from the computer.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein retrieving measured proteins levels comprises displaying the result on a computer display.
7. A computer program product for retrieving protein levels measured in a biological sample from a human, the computer program product comprising: a computer readable medium embodying program code executable by a processor of a computing device or system, the program code comprising: code that retrieves data attributed to a biological sample from an individual, wherein the data comprises protein levels of each protein of a set of proteins comprising at least urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor (suPAR), Growth-differentiation factor 11 (GDF-11), Spondin-1, and Matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP-12), wherein said proteins were measured in the biological sample.
8. The computer program product of claim 7, wherein said measured proteins levels are used in a classification method which uses a continuous measurement score or assigns to two or more classes.
9. A method comprising the following steps: a) contacting a biological sample from a subject with a set of aptamers comprising a 5-position pyrimidine modification, further wherein the 5-position pyrimidine modification comprises a substitution with a hydrophobic chemical group selected from the group consisting of benzyl, indole and naphthyl, further wherein each aptamer specifically binds to a different protein of the set of proteins comprising at least urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor (suPAR), Growth-differentiation factor 11 (GDF-11), Spondin-1, and Matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP-12); b) measuring the level of each of the different proteins in the biological sample from the subject based on measurement of the aptamers; c) determining a predictive score based on the measured levels of each of the different proteins; d) determining a risk level of the subject for having a cardiovascular event based on the predictive score, wherein the cardiovascular event is selected from the group consisting of myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), acute coronary artery syndrome, and congestive heart failure; and e) administering a treatment or therapy to the subject based on the risk level.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the treatment is a drug.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the drug is selected from the group consisting of an anti-thrombotic drug, a platelet inhibitor, a lipid metabolism drug, a fluid balance medication, an electrolyte balance medication, a beta blocker and a combination thereof.
