<title>
Reducing cybersecurity risks when purchasing products over a network
</title>

<abstract>
A computer system, computer program product, and method includes detecting a request for sensitive information to be input by a user, determining that a network is a non-secure network, disabling a sensitive user information input function to prevent the user from entering sensitive information over the unsecure network, generating a unique identifier to be displayed on the computer, wherein the user scans the unique identifier with a mobile device to initiate an automatic transaction over a secure network between the mobile device and the computing system, validating the user operating the mobile device and completing the automatic transaction over the secure network with the mobile device rather than over the unsecure network with the computer.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for reducing a cybersecurity risk using a computing system with a computer display unit and a processor connected to a product database and a user profile database that stores user identifiers and a number of a mobile device for each of the user identifiers, the method comprising: receiving, by the processor, a purchase request from a computer over a first network, wherein the request comprises a user identifier, product information and computer network information; determining, by the processor, that the first network is not secure based on the computer network information; accessing, by the processor, the user profile database and retrieving a mobile device number from the user profile database using the received user identifier; generating, by the processor, a unique identifier using the product information, wherein the unique identifier comprises a computer executable code; displaying, by the processor, the unique identifier on the computer display unit receiving, by the processor, via the computer executable code a second request over a second network, wherein the second request comprises payment information corresponding to the received user identifier; and executing, by the processor, the purchase transaction using the product information and the payment information.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the unique identifier is at least one of a OR code, a shelf label, a bar code, a UPC code, a SKU number, an encrypted token, and a photograph of the product.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the determining that the first network is unsecure includes analyzing an IP address of the computer and confirming that the IP address is connected to the Internet over a public or non-secure network.
4. A computer system with a processor connected to a product database and a user profile database that stores user identifiers and a number of a mobile device for each of the user identifiers; the system comprising: a computer display unit coupled to the processor; and a non-transitory computer readable storage device coupled to the processor, wherein the storage device contains program code then when executed by the processor causes the processor to perform the steps of: receiving, by the processor, a purchase request from a computer over a first network, wherein the request comprises a user identifier, product information and computer network information; determining, by the processor, that the first network is not secure based on the computer network information; accessing, by the processor, the user profile database and retrieving a mobile device number from the user profile database using the received user identifier; generating, by the processor, a unique identifier using the product information, wherein the unique identifier comprises a computer executable code; displaying, by the processor, the unique identifier on the computer display unit receiving, by the processor, via the computer executable code a second request over a second network, wherein the second request comprises payment information corresponding to the received user identifier; and executing, by the processor, the purchase transaction using the product information and the payment information.
5. The computer system of claim 4, wherein the unique identifier is at least one of a OR code, a shelf label, a bar code, a UPC code, a SKU number, an encrypted token, and a photograph of the product.
6. The computer system of claim 4, wherein the validated user information includes biometric data from the user.
7. The computer system of claim 4, wherein the determining that the first network is unsecure includes analyzing an IP address of the computer and confirming that the IP address is connected to the Internet over a public or non-secure network.
8. A computer program product, comprising a non-transitory storage device storing a computer readable program code that when executed by a computer processor of a computing system having a computer display unit and wherein the processor is connected to a product database and user profile database storing user identifiers and a number of a mobile device for each user identifier, causes the computer processor to implement a method, the method comprising: receiving, by the processor, a purchase request from a computer over a first network, wherein the request comprises a user identifier, product information and computer network information; determining, by the processor, that the first network is not secure based on the computer network information; accessing, by the processor, the user profile database and retrieving a mobile device number from the user profile database using the received user identifier; generating, by the processor, a unique identifier using the product information, wherein the unique identifier comprises a computer executable code; displaying, by the processor, the unique identifier on the computer display unit receiving, by the processor, via the computer executable code a second request over a second network, wherein the second request comprises payment information corresponding to the received user identifier; and executing, by the processor, the purchase transaction using the product information and the payment information.
9. The computer program product of claim 8, wherein the unique identifier is at least one of a OR code, a shelf label, a bar code, a UPC code, a SKU number, an encrypted token, and a photograph of the product.
10. The computer program product of claim 8, wherein the validated user information includes biometric data from the user.
11. The computer program product of claim 8, wherein the determining that the first network is unsecure includes analyzing an IP address of the computer and confirming that the IP address is connected to the Internet over a public or non-secure network.
