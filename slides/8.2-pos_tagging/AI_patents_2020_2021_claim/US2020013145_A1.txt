Super-resolution X-ray imaging method and apparatus
</title>

<abstract>
The presently-disclosed technology improves the resolution of an x-ray microscope so as to obtain super-resolution x-ray images having resolutions beyond the maximum normal resolution of the x-ray microscope. Furthermore, the disclosed technology provides for the rapid generation of the super-resolution x-ray images and so enables real-time super-resolution x-ray imaging for purposes of defect detection, for example. A method of super-resolution x-ray imaging using a super-resolving patch classifier is provided. In addition, a method of training the super-resolving patch classifier is disclosed. Other embodiments, aspects and features are also disclosed.

<claims>
1. A method of super-resolution x-ray imaging, the method comprising: obtaining a set of high-resolution x-ray images of an object; dividing each of the high-resolution x-ray images in the set into high-resolution patches; for each patch region, inputting the high-resolution patches corresponding to the patch region to an instance of a trained super-resolving patch classifier to generate a super-resolution patch for the patch region; and stitching together the super-resolution patches for the patch regions to obtain a super-resolution x-ray image of the object.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the set of high-resolution x-ray images of the object are obtained by changing an imaging condition; acquiring a high-resolution x-ray image using the imaging condition; and repeating the changing and acquiring steps until the set of high-resolution x-ray images is complete.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein changing the imaging condition results in a sub-pixel shift from one high-resolution x-ray image to a next high-resolution x-ray image in the set.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the imaging condition comprises an incident angle of the x-ray beam.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the incident angle is changed by varying a position of an x-ray source.
6. The method of claim 3, wherein the imaging condition comprises a position of an x-ray detector.
7. The method of claim 3, wherein the imaging condition comprises a position of the object.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the super-resolving patch classifier comprises a regression classifier.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the regression classifier comprises an artificial neural network.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the regression classifier comprises a support vector machine.
11. The method of claim 1, further comprising: displaying the super-resolution x-ray image on a monitor.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising: using the super-resolution x-ray image for detecting defects in the object.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the super-resolution x-ray image is used for process monitoring.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the super-resolution x-ray image has a resolution that is smaller in size than the high-resolution x-ray image by at least a factor of two.
15. A method of training a super-resolving patch classifier for super-resolution imaging, the method comprising: obtaining a high-resolution image of an object; dividing the high-resolution image into high-resolution patches; obtaining a set of lower-resolution images of an object; dividing each of the lower-resolution images in the set into lower-resolution patches; training the super-resolving patch classifier using the lower-resolution patches for a same patch region as an input and the corresponding high-resolution patch as a known, correct output based on the input; and repeating the training step for all patch regions.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein a ratio between each lower-resolution patch and the corresponding high-resolution patch during training of the super-resolving patch classifier is equal to a ratio between each high-resolution patch and a corresponding super-resolution patch during use of the super-resolving patch classifier for super-resolution imaging.
17. An apparatus for super-resolution x-ray imaging of an object, the apparatus comprising: an x-ray imager; and a computer system for controlling the x-ray imager, wherein the computer system comprises a super-resolving imaging module, the super-resolution imaging module performing steps including: obtaining a set of high-resolution x-ray images of the object; dividing each of the high-resolution x-ray images in the set into high-resolution patches; for each patch region, inputting the high-resolution patches corresponding to the patch region to an instance of a trained super-resolving patch classifier to generate a super-resolution patch for the patch region; and stitching together the super-resolution patches for the patch regions to obtain a super-resolution x-ray image of the object.
18. The apparatus of claim 17, wherein the set of high-resolution x-ray images of the object are obtained by the super-resolution imaging module performing steps of: changing an imaging condition; acquiring a high-resolution x-ray image using the imaging condition; and repeating the changing and acquiring steps until the set of high-resolution x-ray images is complete.
19. The apparatus of claim 18, wherein the imaging condition comprises an incident angle of the x-ray beam.
20. The apparatus of claim 19, wherein the super-resolution imaging module changes the incident angle by varying a position of an x-ray source.
21. The apparatus of claim 18, wherein the imaging condition comprises a position of an x-ray detector.
22. The apparatus of claim 18, wherein the imaging condition comprises a position of the object.
23. The apparatus of claim 17, wherein the super-resolving patch classifier comprises a regression classifier.
24. The apparatus of claim 23, wherein the regression classifier comprises an artificial neural network.
25. The apparatus of claim 23, wherein the regression classifier comprises a support vector machine.
26. The apparatus of claim 17, wherein the apparatus displays the super-resolution image on a monitor.
27. The apparatus of claim 17, wherein the apparatus comprises an inspection machine that uses the super-resolution x-ray image for detecting defects in the object.
