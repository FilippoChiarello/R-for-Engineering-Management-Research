A METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE LIKELIHOOD OF A PATIENT BEING RESPONSIVE TO CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a method for determining the likelihood of a patient being responsive to cancer immunotherapy by determining the amount of T cells expressing the markers PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, and CD38 and the amount of regulatory T cells (T-regs).
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of determining a likelihood of a patient being responsive to cancer immunotherapy, the cancer immunotherapy comprising administration of a checkpoint modulator agent, wherein the patient has been diagnosed with
a. estrogen receptor positive cancer or with
b. breast cancer,
wherein the method comprises the steps of
- identifying immune cells from a tumor sample obtained from said patient;
- determining the number of immune cells expressing a combination of markers selected from PD-1 , CTLA-4, CD38, CD45, CD3, CD25, TIM-3, FOXP3, CD4, and CD8;
- assigning a high likelihood of the patient being responsive to cancer immunotherapy if at least one ratio is above a threshold.
2. The method according to claim 1 , wherein said ratio and said threshold are selected from
• at least 7%, particularly at least 8%, more particularly at least 9% of CD45+ immune cells are CD3+CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells;
• at least 7%, particularly at least 8%, more particularly at least 9% of CD45+ immune cells are CD3+CD4+CD25+FOXP3+CTLA-4+ regulatory T cells;
• at least 3%, particularly at least 4%, more particularly at least 5% of CD45+ immune cells are PD-1+CTLA-4+TIM3OD38 T cells;
• at least 0.1 %, particularly at least 0.2%, more particularly at least 0.3% of
CD45+ immune cells are PD-1+CTLA-4+TIM3+CD38+ T cells;
• at least 22%, particularly at least 25%, more particularly at least 28% of CD4+ T cells are CD3+CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells;
• at least 22%, particularly at least 25%, more particularly at least 28% of CD4+ T cells are CD3+CD4+CD25+FOXP3+CTLA-4+ regulatory T cells;
• at least 4%, particularly at least 5%, more particularly at least 6% of CD45+ immune cells are PD-1+CTLA-4+CD38+CD4+ T cells;
• at least 0.4%, particularly at least 0.5%, more particularly at least 0.6% of CD45+ immune cells are PD-1+CTLA-4+CD38+CD8+ T cells;
• at least 12%, particularly at least 14%, more particularly at least 16% of CD4+ T cells are PD-1 +CTLA-4+CD38+CD4+ T cells; and
• at least 23%, particularly at least 25%, more particularly at least 27% of CD8+ T cells are PD-1 +CTLA-4+CD38+CD8+ T cells.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein a high likelihood of the patient being responsive to cancer immunotherapy is assigned if at least two, particularly at least three, more particularly at least four of said ratios are above their respective threshold.
4. The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein
a. the breast cancer is estrogen receptor positive breast cancer and/or b. the estrogen receptor positive cancer is breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, cervical cancer, or uterine cancer.
5. The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said markers selected from PD-1 , CTLA-4, CD38, CD45, CD3, CD25, TIM-3, LAG-3, FOXP3, CD4, and/or CD8 are identified by mass cytometry.
6. The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said markers selected from PD-1 , CTLA-4, CD38, CD45, CD3, CD25, TIM-3, LAG-3, FOXP3, CD4, and CD8 are identified by fluorescence cytometry.
7. A checkpoint modulator agent for treatment of ER-positive cancer (particularly breast cancer), in a patient assigned a high likelihood of being responsive to the treatment by a method according to any one of claims 1 to 6.
8. The checkpoint modulator agent for treatment of ER-positive cancer according to claim 7, wherein the cancer is characterized by a tumour in which
• at least 7%, particularly at least 8%, more particularly at least 9% of CD45+ immune cells are CD3+CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells;
• at least 7%, particularly at least 8%, more particularly at least 9% of CD45+ immune cells are CD3+CD4+CD25+FOXP3+CTLA-4+ regulatory T cells;
• at least 3%, particularly at least 4%, more particularly at least 5% of CD45+ immune cells are PD-1+CTLA-4+TIM3OD38 T cells;
• at least 0.1 %, particularly at least 0.2%, more particularly at least 0.3% of
CD45+ immune cells are PD-1+CTLA-4+TIM3+CD38+ T cells;
• at least 22%, particularly at least 25%, more particularly at least 28% of CD4+ T cells are CD3+CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells;
• at least 22%, particularly at least 25%, more particularly at least 28% of CD4+ T cells are CD3+CD4+CD25+FOXP3+CTLA-4+ regulatory T cells;
• at least 4%, particularly at least 5%, more particularly at least 6% of CD45+ immune cells are PD-1+CTLA-4+CD38+CD4+ T cells;
• at least 0.4%, particularly at least 0.5%, more particularly at least 0.6% of CD45+ immune cells are PD-1+CTLA-4+CD38+CD8+ T cells;
• at least 12%, particularly at least 14%, more particularly at least 16% of CD4+ T cells are PD-1 +CTLA-4+CD38+CD4+ T cells; or • at least 23%, particularly at least 25%, more particularly at least 27% of CD8+ T cells are PD-1 +CTLA-4+CD38+CD8+ T cells.
9. The checkpoint modulator agent for treatment of ER-positive cancer according to claim 7 or 8, wherein the patient is additionally treated with an anti-estrogen drug.
10. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 6 or the checkpoint modulator agent according to any one of claims 7 to 9, wherein the checkpoint modulator agent is selected from:
a. a non-agonist ligand, particularly a non-agonist antibody or antibody-like molecule, specifically reactive to any one of CTLA-4, PD-1 , PD-L1 , PD-L2, LAG-3, TIM-3, BLTA, TIGIT, VISTA or B7/H3; or
b. an agonist ligand, particularly an agonist antibody or antibody-like molecule, specifically reactive to any one of CD137 (4-1 BB), CD134 (0X40), CD357 (GITR), CD278 (ICOS), CD27, or CD28.
11. A system for the identification of a patient responsive to cancer immunotherapy, said system being capable of identifying immune cells from a tumor sample obtained from a patient and determining the number of immune cells expressing a combination of markers selected from PD-1 , CTLA-4, CD38, CD45, CD3, CD25, TIM-3, FOXP3, CD4, and CD8.
