<title>
Dynamic process execution architecture with disassociated resource control
</title>

<abstract>
The global proliferation of high speed communication networks has created unprecedented opportunities for geographically distributed resource interaction. However, while the opportunities exist and continue to grow, the realization of those opportunities has fallen behind. A dynamic process execution architecture solves the enormous technical challenges of providing effective and efficient process execution environments for geographically distributed resources to execute a complex project.
