<title>
SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTOMATED PLANT GROWTH
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method to optimize plant growth with minimal labor. The system includes a set of sensors, a set of environment controlling equipment, and a processor programmed to acquire data from the sensors and manage operation of the environment controlling equipment based on the sensed data and operator input. The processor is programmed effectively as an artificial intelligence function that learns from sensed information and prior operator inputs to generate control equipment operating instructions that optimize plant growth. A learning network such as an A.I. enabled learning network may be deployed through the processor to gather sensed information directly and indirectly and instruct actuators of the control equipment, and to gather feedback from the operation of that equipment to observe changes in plant environment conditions through sensor information. That learned information is further developed through automated programming modifications of the deep neural network to refine actuator operations and enhance environment conditions.

<claims>
1. A system for plant growth optimization, the system comprising: a sensor apparatus comprising a plurality of sensors contained in a housing, and a processor coupled to the sensor apparatus and programmed to gather information from the plurality of sensors, the processor further configured to communicate with one or more environment control devices to manage operation thereof based on information gathered from the sensor apparatus and from learned behavior to enable substantially automated regulation of the environment within which one or more plant clusters are grown.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising one or more cameras coupled to the sensor apparatus and the processor, wherein the one or more cameras are configured to capture images of the one or more plant clusters, and wherein the processor is programmed to classify such captured images and use classified image information with the sensed information and the learned behavior to optimize the automated regulation of the environment.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the sensor apparatus is rotatable.
4. A method for plant growth optimization, the method comprising the steps of: sensing information about an environment within which one or more plant clusters are grown; transmitting sensed environment information to a processor; gathering information about plant growth optimization through actions of an operator; programming the processor to learn a correlation between the sensed environment information and the information about plant growth optimization; and controlling operation of one or more environment control devices based on the learned correlation to optimizes growth of the one or more plant clusters.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising the steps of: taking images of the one or more plant clusters; classifying the images of the one or more plant clusters; and programming the processor to include the classified image information in the step of learning the correlation between the sensed environment information and the information about plant growth optimization.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the sensed information is acquired with one or more sensors and one or more cameras based in a sensor apparatus, the method further comprising the step of rotating the sensor apparatus to gather the sensed information.
