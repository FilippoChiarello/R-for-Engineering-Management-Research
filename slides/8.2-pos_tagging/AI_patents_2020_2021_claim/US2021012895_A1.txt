SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ANALYZING NOISE IN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY STUDIES
</title>

<abstract>
A system for analyzing noise in one or more electrophysiology studies is provided. The system includes at least one processor and at least one memory device. The memory device stores an application that adapts the at least one processor to: identify, based at least in part on a machine learning model, one or more noise fingerprints within data derived at least in part from one or more study signals acquired from one or more patients during the one or more electrophysiology studies.

<claims>
1. A system for analyzing noise in one or more electrophysiology studies, the system comprising: at least one processor; and at least one memory device that stores an application that adapts the at least one processor to: identify, based at least in part on a machine learning model, one or more noise fingerprints within data derived at least in part from one or more study signals acquired from one or more patients during the one or more electrophysiology studies.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model is an artificial neural network.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein at least one of the one or more noise fingerprints corresponds to at least one of an ablation device, an anesthesia device, a cautery knife, an imaging device, a monitoring device, lighting equipment, a contrast injector, pacing equipment, IT equipment, and powerlines.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein at least two of the one or more electrophysiology studies are performed at different medical sites.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the data provided to the machine learning model corresponds to waveforms.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the waveforms have a range about 0 Hz to about 200 Hz.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the application further adapts the controller to: isolate a region of interest within the data, the region of interest corresponding to a portion between R-waves of a study signal of the one or more study signals.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the application further adapts the controller to: generate a noise map of one or more noise sources based at least in part on the one or more noise fingerprints.
9. A method for analyzing noise in one or more electrophysiology studies, the method comprising: identifying, based at least in part on a machine learning model executing on at least one processor, one or more noise fingerprints within data derived at least in part from one or more study signals acquired from one or more patients during the one or more electrophysiology studies.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the machine learning model is an artificial neural network.
11. The method of claim 9 further comprising: receiving, at the at least one processor, portions of the data from different medical sites.
12. The method of claim 9 further comprising: isolating a region of interest within the data, the region of interest corresponding to a portion between R-waves of a study signal of the one or more study signals.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein, at least one of the one or more noise fingerprints corresponds to at least one of an ablation device, an anesthesia device, a cautery knife, an imaging device, a monitoring device, lighting equipment, a contrast injector, pacing equipment, IT equipment, and powerlines.
14. The method of claim 9 further comprising: transmitting, by way of the at least one processor, a noise source indicator to a medical site, the noise source indicator corresponding to an identified noise fingerprint and a noise source.
15. The method of claim 9 further comprising: generating a noise map of one or more noise sources based at least in part on the one or more noise fingerprints.
16. The method of claim 15 further comprising: transmitting, by way of the at least one processor, the noise map to a medical site.
17. A non-transitory computer readable medium comprising instructions that adapt at least one processor to: identify, based at least in part on a machine learning model, one or more noise fingerprints within data derived at least in part from one or more study signals acquired from one or more patients during one or more electrophysiology studies.
18. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 17, wherein the machine learning model is an artificial neural network.
19. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 17, wherein the instructions further adapt the at least one processor to: transmit a noise source indicator to a medical site, the noise source indicator corresponding to an identified noise fingerprint and a noise source.
20. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 17, wherein the instructions further adapt the at least one processor to: isolate a region of interest within the data, the region of interest corresponding to a portion between R-waves of a study signal of the one or more study signals.
