ESTIMATING OBJECT PROPERTIES USING VISUAL IMAGE DATA
</title>

<abstract>
A system is comprised of one or more processors coupled to memory. The one or more processors are configured to receive image data based on an image captured using a camera of a vehicle and to utilize the image data as a basis of an input to a trained machine learning model to at least in part identify a distance of an object from the vehicle. The trained machine learning model has been trained using a training image and a correlated output of an emitting distance sensor.

<claims>
1. A system, comprising: one or more processors configured to: receive image data based on an image captured using a camera of a vehicle; and utilize the image data as a basis of an input to a trained machine learning model to at least in part identify a distance of an object from the vehicle; wherein the trained machine learning model has been trained using a training image and a correlated output of an emitting distance sensor; and a memory coupled to the one or more processors.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to identify a direction of the object with respect to the vehicle.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more processors are further configured to identify a velocity vector of the object with respect to the vehicle.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the emitting distance sensor includes a radar sensor.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the emitting distance sensor includes an ultrasonic sensor.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the emitting distance sensor includes a lidar sensor.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the object is one of the following: a pedestrian, a vehicle, an obstacle, a barrier, or a traffic control object.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the training image and the correlated output of the emitting distance sensor were captured on a training vehicle.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the output of the emitting distance sensor includes an estimated distance of a second object from the training vehicle and an estimated direction of the second object with respect to the training vehicle, and wherein the second object is identified in the training image.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the training image is one of a time series of images captured using an image sensor of the training vehicle.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the second object is identified at least in part by analyzing a plurality of images included in the time series of images.
12. The system of claim 10, wherein the time series of images is used to disambiguate an output portion of the emitting sensor corresponding to the second object among a plurality of objects detected by the emitting distance sensor.
13. The system of claim 1, wherein the identified distance of the object from the vehicle is used to predict a semantic label associated with the object.
14. The system of claim 1, wherein the trained machine learning model has been trained to predict a distance output of the emitting distance sensor based on an input image.
15. The system of claim 1, wherein the distance of the object identified using the trained machine learning model is used in combination with an output of an installed emitting distance sensor included on the vehicle to determine a relative location of the object with respect to the vehicle.
16. A computer program product, the computer program product being embodied in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium and comprising computer instructions for: receiving image data based on an image captured using a camera of a vehicle; and utilizing the image data as a basis of an input to a trained machine learning model to at least in part identify a distance of an object from the vehicle, wherein the trained machine learning model has been trained using a training image and a correlated output of an emitting distance sensor.
17. A method, comprising: receiving a selected image based on an image captured using a camera of a vehicle; receiving distance data based on an emitting distance sensor of the vehicle; identifying an object using the selected image as an input to a trained machine learning model; extracting a distance estimate of the identified object from the received distance data; creating a training image by annotating the selected image with the extracted distance estimate; training a second machine learning model to predict a distance measurement using a training data set that includes the training image; and providing the trained second machine learning model to a second vehicle equipped with a second camera.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the captured image is part of a time series of captured images and the distance data is part of a time series of captured distance data.
19. The method of claim 18, further comprising tracking the identified object across the time series of captured images and wherein the extracted distance estimate is based on correlating the tracked identified object to the received distance data.
20. The method of claim 17, wherein the identified object is a detected vehicle or a pedestrian.
