METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SUPPORTING FAST LINK RECOVERY AND LINK STATUS REPORTING IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A method and apparatus for supporting a fast link recovery and link status reporting in a wireless communication system is provided. When a node detects a radio link problem on a wireless backhaul link between integrated access and backhaul (IAB) nodes from the node to a donor node of an TAB network, the node reselects a cell operated by a gNB which is directly connected to the donor node, and performs a random access procedure towards the cell operated by the gNB to report information on the radio link problem to the cell. The donor node may establish a new path for the node.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method performed by a node in a wireless communication system, the method comprising: detecting a radio link problem on a wireless backhaul link between integrated access and backhaul (IAB) nodes from the node to a donor node of an IAB network; reselecting a cell operated by a gNB which is directly connected to the donor node; performing a random access procedure towards the cell operated by the gNB; and reporting information on the radio link problem to the cell.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the gNB is in proximity of the node.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the gNB does not belongs to the IAB network.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the radio link problem includes a radio link failure (RLF), a case that a specific criteria of a reference signal received power (RSRP) threshold is not satisfied and/or a case that a specific criteria of throughput threshold is not satisfied.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein an offset is applied to the cell.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the cell is reselected based on an RSRP of the cell.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the RSRP of the cell is better than any other cells of other gNBs or other IAB nodes.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein an access priority is applied to the cell even when an RSRP of the cell is worse than IAB nodes in proximity.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the information on the radio link problem includes identifiers (IDs) of the TAB nodes and/or an ID of the donor node.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the information on the radio link problem includes an ID of an IAB node of which measured RSRP is better than any other IAB nodes.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein a new path from the donor node to the node is selected by the donor node.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the node includes an IAB node including both a user equipment (UE) part and a mobile terminating (MT) part.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the node includes a UE.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the donor node includes a central unit (CU) and a distributed unit (DU).
15. The method of claim 1, wherein the first node is in communication with at least one of a user equipment, a network, and/or autonomous vehicles other than the first node.
16. A node in a wireless communication system, the node comprising: a memory; a transceiver; and a processor, operably coupled to the memory and the transceiver, wherein the node is configured to: detect a radio link problem on a wireless backhaul link between integrated access and backhaul (IAB) nodes from the node to a donor node of an IAB network, reselect a cell operated by a gNB which is directly connected to the donor node, perform a random access procedure towards the cell operated by the gNB, and report, via the transceiver, information on the radio link problem to the cell.
17. A processor for a node in a wireless communication system, wherein the processor is configured to: detect a radio link problem on a wireless backhaul link between integrated access and backhaul (IAB) nodes from the node to a donor node of an TAB network, reselect a cell operated by a gNB which is directly connected to the donor node, perform a random access procedure towards the cell operated by the gNB, and control the node to report information on the radio link problem to the cell.
