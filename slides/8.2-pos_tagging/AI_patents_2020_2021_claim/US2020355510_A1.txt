METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR MULTI-MODAL TRANSPORTATION
</title>

<abstract>
Multi-modal itineraries may be scheduled by setting a time to request a future transportation mode. An itinerary including a set of transportation modes to allow a rider to travel from an origin to a destination may be obtained. A first non-self-controlled transportation mode from the set of transportation modes may be obtained. A second non-self-controlled transportation mode from the set of transportation modes may be obtained. A request time for the second non-self-controlled transportation mode may be scheduled.

<claims>
1. A system for scheduling multi-modal itineraries, comprising one or more processors and one or more non-transitory computer-readable memories coupled to the one or more processors and configured with instructions executable by the one or more processors to cause the system to perform operations comprising: obtaining an itinerary including a set of transportation modes to allow a rider to travel from an origin to a destination; obtaining a first non-self-controlled transportation mode from the set of transportation modes; obtaining a second non-self-controlled transportation mode from the set of transportation modes; and scheduling a time for requesting the second non-self-controlled transportation mode.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the itinerary is obtained based on a selection by the rider.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the first non-self-controlled mode includes public transportation.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the second non-self-controlled mode includes ride sharing.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the time for requesting the ride sharing is during the first non-self-controlled mode.
6. The system of claim 1, the operations further comprising: obtaining a start time of the second non-self-controlled transportation mode; and scheduling the time for requesting the second non-self-controlled transportation mode before the start time.
7. The system of claim 1, the operations further comprising: determining a delay during the first non-self-controlled transportation mode, wherein the delay causes the rider to miss a start time of the second non-self-controlled transportation mode; and generating a set of tail itineraries, wherein each itinerary in the set of tail itineraries includes a set of transportation modes to allow the rider to travel from a current location to the destination.
8. A method for scheduling multi-modal itineraries, comprising: obtaining an itinerary including a set of transportation modes to allow a rider to travel from an origin to a destination; obtaining a first non-self-controlled transportation mode from the set of transportation modes; obtaining a second non-self-controlled transportation mode from the set of transportation modes; and scheduling a time for requesting the second non-self-controlled transportation mode.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the itinerary is obtained based on a selection by the rider.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the first non-self-controlled mode includes public transportation.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein the second non-self-controlled mode includes ride sharing.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the time for requesting the ride sharing is during the first non-self-controlled mode.
13. The method of claim 8, further comprising: obtaining a start time of the second non-self-controlled transportation mode; and scheduling the time for requesting the second non-self-controlled transportation mode before the start time.
14. The method of claim 8, further comprising: determining a delay during the first non-self-controlled transportation mode, wherein the delay causes the rider to miss a start time of the second non-self-controlled transportation mode; and generating a set of tail itineraries, wherein each itinerary in the set of tail itineraries includes a set of transportation modes to allow the rider to travel from a current location to the destination.
15. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium configured with instructions executable by one or more processors to cause the one or more processors to perform operations comprising: obtaining an itinerary including a set of transportation modes to allow a rider to travel from an origin to a destination; obtaining a first non-self-controlled transportation mode from the set of transportation modes; obtaining a second non-self-controlled transportation mode from the set of transportation modes; and scheduling a time for requesting the second non-self-controlled transportation mode.
16. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the itinerary is obtained based on a selection by the rider.
17. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the second non-self-controlled mode includes ride sharing.
18. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein the time for requesting the ride sharing is during the first non-self-controlled mode.
19. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, the operations further comprising: obtaining a start time of the second non-self-controlled transportation mode; and scheduling the time for requesting the second non-self-controlled transportation mode before the start time
20. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 15, the operations further comprising: determining a delay during the first non-self-controlled transportation mode, wherein the delay causes the rider to miss a start time of the second non-self-controlled transportation mode; and generating a set of tail itineraries, wherein each itinerary in the set of tail itineraries includes a set of transportation modes to allow the rider to travel from a current location to the destination.
