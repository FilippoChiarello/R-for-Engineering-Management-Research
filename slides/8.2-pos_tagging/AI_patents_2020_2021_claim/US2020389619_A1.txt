PHOTOGRAPHING DEVICE OUTPUTTING TAGGED IMAGE FRAMES
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a photographing device having two output interfaces that respectively used to output a first image frame and a second image frame. The first image frame is provided to a processor of the photographing device to perform the feature extraction and tag the second image frame accordingly. The tagged second image frame is for the image recording of an external back end.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A photographing device, comprising: an image sensor configured to capture image data; an output interface coupled to the image sensor, and configured to output an image frame corresponding to the image data to downstream of the photographing device; and a processor coupled to the output interface, and configured to receive the image frame from the output interface, and identify a predetermined feature in the image frame, wherein the output interface is configured not to output following image frames to the processor for a predetermined interval after the image frame is identified containing the predetermined feature.
2. The photographing device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the image frame is outputted to a back end circuit, and the image sensor is further configured to receive an auto exposure control signal from the back end circuit or from the processor.
3. The photographing device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to add a tag in a data header of the image frame that is identified containing the predetermined feature.
4. The photographing device as claimed in claim 3, wherein the tag comprises at least one of a moving object tag, an identification tag, a face tag, a skin color tag, a human shape tag, a vehicle tag and a license plate tag.
5. The photographing device as claimed in claim 1, wherein when identifying that the predetermined feature disappears from the image frame, the output interface is configured not to output the image frame to the downstream.
6. The photographing device as claimed in claim 1, wherein before the processor identifies the image frame containing the predetermined feature, the output interface is configured not to output the image frame to the downstream.
7. A photographing device, comprising: an image sensor configured to capture image data; an output interface coupled to the image sensor, and configured to output an image frame corresponding to the image data to downstream of the photographing device; and a processor coupled to the output interface, and configured to receive the image frame from the output interface, and identify a predetermined feature in the image frame, wherein before the processor identifies the image frame containing the predetermined feature, the output interface is controlled not to output the image frame to the downstream.
8. The photographing device as claimed in claim 7, wherein the image frame is outputted to a back end circuit, and the image sensor is further configured to receive an auto exposure control signal from the back end circuit or from the processor.
9. The photographing device as claimed in claim 7, wherein the processor is further configured to add a tag in a data header of the image frame that is identified containing the predetermined feature.
10. The photographing device as claimed in claim 9, wherein the tag comprises at least one of a moving object tag, an identification tag, a face tag, a skin color tag, a human shape tag, a vehicle tag and a license plate tag.
11. The photographing device as claimed in claim 9, wherein the tag is added by using a register to change a digital value.
12. The photographing device as claimed in claim 7, wherein the outputting of the image frame is controlled using a switching device or a multiplexer.
13. A photographing device, comprising: an image sensor configured to capture image data of multiple pixels; a first output interface coupled to the image sensor, and configured to output a first image frame, which corresponds to a part of the captured image data and has a first size; and a second output interface coupled to the image sensor, and configured to output a second image frame, which corresponds to the captured image data and has a second size, to downstream of the photographing device, wherein the second size is larger than the first size, and the second image frame is further added with at least one tag determined according to the first image frame.
14. The photographing device as claimed in claim 13, wherein the first image frame is acquired within a frame period by turning off a part of pixels of the image sensor.
15. The photographing device as claimed in claim 13, wherein the first image frame is generated by downsampling the image data outputted by the image sensor.
16. The photographing device as claimed in claim 13, wherein the first output interface and the second output interface are not configured to output image frames simultaneously.
17. The photographing device as claimed in claim 13, wherein the second image frame is added with the at least one tag when the first image frame contains at least one predetermined feature.
18. The photographing device as claimed in claim 13, wherein the at least one tag is selected from the group consisting of a moving object tag, an identification tag, a face tag, a skin color tag, a human shape tag, a vehicle tag and a license plate tag.
19. The photographing device as claimed in claim 13, wherein the at least one tag is added in a data header of the second image frame.
20. The photographing device as claimed in claim 13, wherein whether to output the second image frame added with the at least one tag to the downstream is determined according to an output result of a passive infrared radiation sensor.
