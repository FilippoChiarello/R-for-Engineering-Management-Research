REMOTE SKU ON-BOARDING OF PRODUCTS FOR SUBSEQUENT VIDEO IDENTIFICATION AND SALE
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for remote SKU on-boarding of products for identification and sale which can include collecting image data in an environment; triggering computer vision detection of an item; processing the image data for item detection; relaying item related image data to a product mapping tool upon detection of item detection exception; presenting image data in the product mapping tool and receiving product identifier input; and updating a computer vision monitoring system in response to the product identifier input.
</abstract>

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method comprising: collecting image data in an environment; triggering computer vision detection of an item; processing the image data for item detection; relaying item related image data to a product mapping tool upon detection of item detection exception; presenting image data in the product mapping tool and receiving product identifier input; and updating a computer vision monitoring system in response to the product identifier input.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein processing the image data comprises identifying a product identity with a computer vision processing model; and wherein updating a computer vision monitoring system in response to the product identifier input comprises updating the computer vision processing model based on mapping of the item identifier input to item related image data.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising tracking the item and collecting item related image data.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein updating the computer vision monitoring system in response to the product identifier input comprises applying a product identifier to an environment model based on the product identifier input.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein processing the image data for item detection comprises detecting an item location on a shelf; and wherein applying the product identifier to the environment model comprises updating the item location with the product identifier within a map of product shelf placement.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein applying the product identifier to the environment model comprises labeling a product identity of the item involved in a user-item interaction.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein triggering computer vision detection of an item comprises detecting a user-item interaction with the item.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein updating the computer vision monitoring system in response to the product identifier input comprises labeling the item of the user-item interaction with the item identifier.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein relaying the item related image data comprises prioritizing and queuing an item identification task based on predicted user path.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising generating a set of candidate product identifiers and within the product mapping tool presenting the set of candidate product identifiers.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein generating the set of candidate product identifiers is based in part on product identifiers of items in proximity to the item, product placement data from other store locations, and shopper history for a user interacting with the item.
12. The method of claim 10, further comprising providing a query input field, and wherein generating the filtering the set of candidate product identifiers is based at least in part on input of the query input field.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein triggering computer vision detection of the item comprises periodically performing item detection processing of the image data
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the image data is communicated to a product mapping tool of a remote client device.
15. A machine-readable storage medium comprising instructions that, when executed by one or more computer processors of one or more computing devices, cause the machine to perform operations comprising: collecting image data in an environment; triggering computer vision detection of an item; processing the image data for item detection; relaying item related image data to a product mapping tool upon detection of item detection exception; presenting image data in the product mapping tool and receiving product identifier input; and updating a computer vision monitoring system in response to the product identifier input.
16. The machine-readable storage medium of claim 16, wherein processing the image data comprises identifying a product identity with a computer vision processing model; and wherein updating a computer vision monitoring system in response to the product identifier input comprises updating the computer vision processing model based on mapping of the item identifier input to item related image data.
17. The machine-readable storage medium of claim 16, wherein processing the image data for item detection comprises detecting an item location on a shelf; and wherein applying the product identifier to the environment model comprises updating the item location with the product identifier within a map of product shelf placement.
18. The machine-readable storage medium of claim 16, wherein triggering computer vision detection of the item comprises detecting a user-item interaction with the item; and wherein updating the computer vision monitoring system in response to the product identifier input comprises labeling the item of the user-item interaction with the item identifier.
19. A system comprising of: an imaging system configured to collect image data one or more computer-readable mediums storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more computer processors, cause a computing platform to perform operations comprising: trigger computer vision detection of an item; process the image data for item detection; relay item related image data to a product mapping tool upon detection of item detection exception; present image data in the product mapping tool and receiving product identifier input; and updating a computer vision monitoring system in response to the product identifier input.
