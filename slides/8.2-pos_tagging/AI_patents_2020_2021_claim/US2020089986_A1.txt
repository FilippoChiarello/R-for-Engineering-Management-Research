<title>
AUTOMATED ROBOTIC MICROSCOPY SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides automated robotic microscopy systems that facilitate high throughput and high content analysis of biological samples, such as living cells and/or tissues. In certain aspects, the systems are configured to reduce user intervention relative to existing technologies, and allow for precise return to and re-imaging of the same field (e.g., the same cell) that has been previously imaged. This capability enables experiments and testing of hypotheses that deal with causality over time with greater precision and throughput than conventional microscopy methods.
