<title>
INTERMITTENT MONITORING
</title>

<abstract>
Various examples are directed to systems and methods for monitoring a patient. For example, patient data of a first type may be monitored with a low-fidelity monitoring technique over a first time period. Patient behavior may be evaluated based on the monitored first type of patient data. Patient data of a second type may be monitored over a second time period with a continuous glucose monitor device. A parameter of the continuous glucose monitor device may be based on the evaluated patient behavior during the monitoring.

<claims>
1. A method of monitoring a patient, comprising: monitoring patient data of a first type with a low-fidelity monitoring technique over a first time period; evaluating patient behavior based on the monitored first type of patient data; and monitoring over a second time period patient data of a second type with a continuous glucose monitor device, wherein a parameter of the continuous glucose monitor device is based on the evaluated patient behavior during the monitoring.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the parameter of the continuous glucose monitor device corresponds to operation of a user interface.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the low-fidelity monitoring technique comprises at least one of single point glucose monitoring, blinded continuous glucose monitoring, or an optical monitoring technique.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the low-fidelity monitoring technique comprises activity monitoring by a wearable fitness tracker.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the wearable fitness tracker comprises at least one of a wearable heart rate monitor, activity monitor, smart phone, smart glasses, or smart watch.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the low-fidelity monitoring technique comprises receiving user input data comprising at least one of medicament data, meal data, exercise data, or sleep data.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining a goal for the patient, and wherein the parameter of the continuous glucose monitor device is related to the goal.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the goal includes a dietary goal, an exercise goal, a glucose level monitoring goal, or a medication goal.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the determining the goal for the patient is based at least in part on the data of the first type monitored over the first time period with the low-fidelity monitoring technique.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining the parameter of the continuous glucose monitor device at least in part by determining at least one parameter for an automated coaching routine.
11. The method of claim 1, further comprising: detecting a change in a patient parameter between the first time period and the second time period; and determining the parameter of the continuous glucose monitor device using the detected change in the patient parameter.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising providing a coaching functionality to the patient over the first time period, the coaching functionality comprising automated messages transmitted from a server to the continuous glucose monitor device, wherein the coaching functionality is based on patient profile data or the patient data of the first type or a combination thereof.
13. A system comprising: a low-fidelity system configured to collect a first set of sensor data of a first type relating to a patient over a first time period; a continuous glucose monitor device configured to collect a second set of sensor data of a second type of data relating to the patient; and a decision system configured to determine a parameter for the continuous glucose monitor device based upon the first set of sensor data.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein low-fidelity system includes an activity sensor.
15. The system of claim 13, wherein low-fidelity system includes a blood glucose meter.
16. The system of claim 13, wherein the continuous glucose monitor device includes a continuous glucose monitor.
17. The system of claim 13, wherein the parameter includes a schedule for use of the continuous glucose monitor device.
18. The system of claim 13, wherein the parameter is a time to initiate us of the continuous glucose monitor device.
19. The system of claim 13, further comprising a third system configured to collect a third set of sensor data relating to the patient, wherein the decision system determines the parameter based at least in part on the first set of sensor data and the third set of sensor data.
20. A machine-readable medium comprising instructions thereon that, when executed by at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to perform operations comprising: monitoring patient data of a first type with a low-fidelity monitoring technique over a first time period; evaluating patient behavior based on the monitored first type of patient data; and monitoring over a second time period patient data of a second type with a continuous glucose monitor device, wherein a parameter of the continuous glucose monitor device is based on the evaluated patient behavior during the monitoring.
