WIDEBAND DUAL-POLARIZED ELECTRICALLY COUPLED AND CONNECTED RADIATORS ON A TRIANGULAR LATTICE
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided for implementing wideband radiators that conform to regular equilateral triangular lattices with little to no performance compromise for typical offset pairs of dual-polarized element arrangements. This general radiator family/group/configuration can be referred to as the Slant Tri-V (STV) element based on the basic characteristic set of this radiator group and relative differences to conventional array elements normally seen on rectangular or triangular lattice arrangements. The STV array element has wideband, dual-polarized operation and conforms to the most efficiently sampled array lattice for the lowest array element count possible for phased arrays.
