METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING AT LEAST ONE PRODUCTION VALUE FOR PRODUCING A CUSTOM-TAILORED COMPRESSION GARMENT FOR A LIMB AND COMPUTER PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
Computer-implemented method for determining at least one production value for producing a custom tailored compression garment for a limb (23), wherein the production value is associated with at least one measurement position along the length of the limb (23), comprising the steps of: - receiving a three dimensional dataset of the limb (23) acquired using a 3D scan device (20), - evaluating the dataset to derive at least one reference information describing the position (1-14) of an anatomical feature of the limb (23) along the length of the limb (23), - determining the at least one measurement position for the at least one production value in the three dimensional dataset using at least one rule of a rule set (34), wherein each rule relates at least one reference information to at least one measurement position, - determining the at least one production value from the three dimensional dataset at the at least one determined measurement position.
