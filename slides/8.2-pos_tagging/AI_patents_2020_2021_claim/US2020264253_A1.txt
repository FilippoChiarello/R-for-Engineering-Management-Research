PARKINSON'S DISEASE DIAGNOSING APPARATUS AND METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are Parkinson's disease diagnosing apparatus and method and a configuration which includes an image acquiring unit which acquires a multi-echo magnitude and a phase image from MRI obtained by capturing a brain of a patient, an image processing unit which post-processes only substantia nigra and a nigrosome-1 region proposed as an imaging biomarker of the Parkinson's disease from the acquired image to be observed; an image analyzing unit which classifies images including the nigrosome-1 region by analyzing the processed images and detects the nigrosome-1 region from the classified image, and a diagnosing unit which determines whether the nigrosome-1 region is normal in the classified image to diagnose the Parkinson's disease is provided so that only the image which includes the nigrosome-1 region is classified in the MRI and the nigrosome-1 region is analyzed from the classified image to diagnose the Parkinson's disease.

<claims>
1. A Parkinson's disease diagnosing apparatus, comprising: an image acquiring unit which acquires a multi-echo magnitude and a phase image from MRI obtained by capturing a brain of a patient, an image processing unit which post-processes only substantia nigra and a nigrosome-1 region proposed as an imaging biomarker of the Parkinson's disease from the acquired image to be observed; an image analyzing unit which classifies images including the nigrosome-1 region by analyzing the processed images and detects the nigrosome-1 region from the classified image, and a diagnosing unit which determines whether the nigrosome-1 region is normal in the classified image to diagnose the Parkinson's disease.
2. The Parkinson's disease diagnosing apparatus of claim 1, wherein the image processing unit applies a quantitative susceptibility map mask to the image acquired by the image acquiring unit using a quantitative susceptibility mapping algorithm to post-process the image through susceptibility map weighted imaging.
3. The Parkinson's disease diagnosing apparatus of claim 1, wherein the image analyzing unit classifies the entire MRI into an image which includes the nigrosome-1 region and an image which does not include the nigrosome-1 region through machine learning, specifies a position of the nigrosome-1 region in the classified image which includes the nigrosome-1 region to detect the nigrosome-1 region.
4. The Parkinson's disease diagnosing apparatus of claim 3, wherein the diagnosing unit analyzes whether the nigrosome-1 region detected by the analyzing unit is normal using the machine learning to diagnose the Parkinson's disease.
5. A Parkinson's disease diagnosing method which generates a susceptibility map weighted imaging image which includes a nigrosome-1 region proposed as an imaging biomarker of the Parkinson's disease by applying a quantitative susceptibility mapping algorithm to an MRI captured by MRI equipment and analyzes the nigrosome-1 region from the generated image to diagnose the Parkinson's disease.
6. The Parkinson's disease diagnosing method of claim 5, comprising: (a) acquiring a multi-echo magnitude and a phase image from MRI obtained by capturing a brain of a patient, using an image acquiring unit, (b) post-processing only substantia nigra and a nigrosome-1 region proposed as an imaging biomarker of the Parkinson's disease from the acquired image to be observed, using an image processing unit, (c) classifying images including the nigrosome-1 region by analyzing the processed images using an image analyzing unit and detecting the nigrosome-1 region from the classified image, and (d) diagnosing the Parkinson's disease by analyzing whether the nigrosome-1 region detected from each analyzed image is normal, using a diagnosing unit.
7. The Parkinson's disease diagnosing method of claim 6, wherein in step (b), the image processing unit applies a quantitative susceptibility map mask to the image acquired by the image acquiring unit using a quantitative susceptibility mapping algorithm to post-process the image through a susceptibility map weighted imaging.
8. The Parkinson's disease diagnosing method of claim 7, wherein in step (c), the image analyzing unit classifies an image which includes the nigrosome-1 region and an image which does not include the nigrosome-1 region from the entire MRI through machine learning and specifies the nigrosome-1 region from the classified image which includes the nigrosome-1 region to detect the nigrosome-1 region, and in step (d), the diagnosing unit analyzes whether the nigrosome-1 region detected by the image analyzing unit is normal using the machine learning to diagnose the Parkinson's disease.
