METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING VIRTUAL MALICIOUS TRAFFIC TEMPLATE FOR TERMINAL GROUP INCLUDING DEVICE INFECTED WITH MALICIOUS CODE
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a method of generating malicious traffic, the method being performed by a computing apparatus and comprising obtaining traffic data transmitted from a first device infected with first malicious code or received by the first device, generating a traffic template of the first device by analyzing the traffic data, and generating a malicious traffic template of a terminal group, wherein the malicious traffic template of the terminal group comprises the traffic template of the first device.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of generating malicious traffic, the method being performed by a computing apparatus and comprising: obtaining traffic data transmitted from a first device infected with first malicious code or received by the first device; generating a traffic template of the first device by analyzing the traffic data; and generating a malicious traffic template of a terminal group, wherein the malicious traffic template of the terminal group comprises the traffic template of the first device.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the traffic template of the first device by analyzing the traffic data comprises analyzing the traffic data received by the first device.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the traffic template of the first device by analyzing the traffic data comprises analyzing the traffic data transmitted from the first device.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the traffic template of the first device by analyzing the traffic data comprises analyzing traffic data related to a user of the terminal group.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein analyzing the traffic data related to the user of the terminal group comprises: generating a first traffic template of the first device by analyzing traffic data related to a first user of the terminal group; and generating a second traffic template of the first device by analyzing traffic data related to a second user of the terminal group.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the traffic template of the first device by analyzing the traffic data comprises analyzing traffic data related to a function used in the first device.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein analyzing the traffic data related to the function used in the first device comprises: generating a third traffic template of the first device by analyzing traffic data related to a first function of the first device; and generating a fourth traffic template of the first device by analyzing traffic data related to a second function of the first device.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the traffic template comprises a packet comprising an Internet protocol (IP) address of a control & command (C&C) server of the first malicious code.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the traffic template comprises random noise traffic irrelevant to the first malicious code.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the malicious traffic template of the terminal group further comprises normal state traffic data of the first device.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein generating the malicious traffic template of the terminal group comprises inserting a behavior pattern of the first malicious code into the normal state traffic data of the first device.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the malicious traffic template of the terminal group further comprises a traffic template of a second device included in the terminal group.
13. A method of generating malicious traffic, the method being performed by a computing apparatus and comprising: obtaining normal traffic data related to a terminal group which comprises a first device not infected with malicious code; generating a virtual malicious traffic template of the first device infected with malicious code by using the normal traffic data of the first device and behavior analysis information of first malicious code; and generating a malicious traffic template of the terminal group, wherein the malicious traffic template of the terminal group comprises the malicious traffic template related to the first device infected with the malicious code.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein generating the virtual malicious traffic template of the first device infected with malicious code by using the normal traffic data of the first device and the behavior analysis information of the first malicious code comprises: obtaining a behavior pattern of the first malicious code from the behavior analysis information of the first malicious code; and generating a malicious traffic template related to the first device infected with the malicious code by inserting the behavior pattern of the first malicious code into the normal traffic data.
15. A computing apparatus comprising: a memory into which a malicious traffic generation program is loaded; and a processor which executes the malicious traffic generation program loaded into the memory, wherein the malicious traffic generation program comprises: an instruction for obtaining traffic data transmitted from a first device infected with first malicious code or received by the first device; an instruction for generating a traffic template of the first device by analyzing the traffic data; and an instruction for generating a malicious traffic template of a terminal group, wherein the malicious traffic template of the terminal group comprises the traffic template of the first device.
