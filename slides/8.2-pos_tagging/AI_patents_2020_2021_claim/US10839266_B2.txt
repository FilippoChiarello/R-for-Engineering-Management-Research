<title>
Distributed object detection processing
</title>

<abstract>
Various systems and methods for implementing distributed object detection processing are described herein. An object detection system includes a plurality of computer vision accelerators to process a respective plurality of portions of an input image and produce a list of detected objects in the respective plurality of portions of the input image; and a processor subsystem to: combine the list of detected objects from each of the plurality of computer vision accelerators, to produce a combined list of detected objects; sort the combined list of detected objects; and remove duplicate entries in the combined list of detected objects to produce an output list of detected objects.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An object detection system, the system comprising: a plurality of computer vision accelerator circuits to process a respective plurality of portions of an input image and produce a list of detected objects in the respective plurality of portions of the input image; and a processor subsystem to: combine the list of detected objects from each of the plurality of computer vision accelerator circuits, to produce a combined list of detected objects; sort the combined list of detected objects based on locations of the detected objects in the input image; and remove duplicate entries in the combined list of detected objects to produce an output list of detected objects.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of computer vision accelerator circuits includes a computer vision accelerator circuit to process a scaled-down version of the input image and produce a list of detected objects in the scaled-down image.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein one portion of the input image comprises a left portion and another portion of the input image comprises a right portion of the input image.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the left portion and the right portion include an overlapping area of the input image.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the left portion and the right portion are each at least 55% of the input image.
6. The system of claim 4, wherein the left portion and the right portion are each no more than 75% of the input image.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein to sort the combined list of detected objects, the processor subsystem is to sort the combined list based on coordinates of bounding boxes that contain detected objects in the combined list.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein to remove duplicate entries in the combined list of detected objects, the processor subsystem is to compare bounding boxes of adjacent entries, and replace entries with similar bounding boxes with a replacement bounding box.
9. A method of object detection, the method comprising: splitting an input frame into a plurality of portions; transmitting the plurality of portions to a plurality of computer vision accelerator circuits, each computer vision accelerator circuit to process only one of the plurality of portions; performing an object detection process on the plurality of portions at each of the computer vision accelerator circuits; outputting a list of objects detected in each of the computer vision accelerator circuits; sorting the list of objects based on locations of the objects in the input frame; and removing duplicate entries in the list of objects.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising: providing a scaled-down version of the input frame to another computer vision accelerator circuit, the another computer vision accelerator circuit distinct from the plurality of computer vision accelerator circuits; and performing the object detection process on the scaled-down version to produce a list of objects detected in the scaled-down version.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein splitting the input frame comprises splitting the input frame into a first part and a second part, the first and second parts of equal size with an overlapping area.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the first and second parts are each at least 55% of the input frame.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the first and second parts are each no more than 75% of the input frame.
14. The method of claim 9, wherein sorting the list of objects comprises sorting the list of objects based on coordinates of bounding boxes that contain objects in the list.
15. The method of claim 9, wherein removing duplicate entries in the list of objects comprises comparing bounding boxes of adjacent entries, and replacing entries with similar bounding boxes with a replacement bounding box.
16. At least one non-transitory machine-readable medium, including instructions for object detection, which when executed on a machine, cause the machine to perform the operations comprising: splitting an input frame into a plurality of portions; transmitting the plurality of portions to a plurality of computer vision accelerator circuits, each computer vision accelerator circuit to process only one of the plurality of portions; performing an object detection process on the plurality of portions at each of the computer vision accelerator circuits; outputting a list of objects detected in each of the computer vision accelerator circuits; sorting the list of objects based on locations of the objects in the input frame; and removing duplicate entries in the list of objects.
17. The at least one non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 16, further comprising: providing a scaled-down version of the input frame to another computer vision accelerator circuit, the another computer vision accelerator circuit distinct from the plurality of computer vision accelerator circuits; and performing the object detection process on the scaled-down version to produce a list of objects detected in the scaled-down version.
18. The at least one non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 16, wherein splitting the input frame comprises splitting the input frame into a first part and a second part, the first and second parts of equal size with an overlapping area.
19. The at least one non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 18, wherein the first and second parts are each at least 55% first and second.
20. The at least one non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 18, wherein the first and second parts are each no more than 75% first and second.
21. The at least one non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 16, wherein sorting the list of objects comprises sorting the list of objects based on coordinates of bounding boxes that contain objects in the list.
