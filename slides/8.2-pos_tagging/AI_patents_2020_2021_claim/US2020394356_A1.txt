TEXT INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD, DEVICE AND TERMINAL
</title>

<abstract>
A text information processing method, device and terminal, wherein the method comprises: determining a pinyin character string corresponding to text information; using an N-tuple algorithm to convert the pinyin character string into a string set that comprises a plurality of character string elements; determining an index and the occurrence number, in a total string set, of each character string element in the string set; generating a pinyin hash vector corresponding to the text information according to the index and occurrence number corresponding to each character string element; and processing the pinyin hash vector by means of an embedded neural network to obtain continuous features corresponding to the text information.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for processing text information, wherein the method comprises: determining a first pinyin string corresponding to text information; determining a first string set based on the first pinyin string, wherein the first string set comprises a plurality of first string elements; determining an index and an occurrence number of each first string element in a total string set; generating a pinyin hash vector based on the index and the occurrence number; and determining continuous features of the text information based on the pinyin hash vector and an embedded neural network.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein said determining the first string set, comprises: determining the first string set by using a sliding window algorithm based on the first pinyin string, wherein the sliding window algorithm comprises a preset step length and a window size.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the method further comprise: determining second pinyin strings of words in a dictionary; generating a second string element by adding placeholders before and after a second pinyin string for each of the words respectively; determining a second string set based on the second string element; and generating the total string set by uniting second string sets.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein said generating a pinyin hash vector, comprises: generating a zero vector, wherein a dimension of the zero vector is equal to that of the total string set; determining a dimension of the index in the zero vector; generating the pinyin hash vector by adjusting a numerical value of the dimension as the occurrence number.
5. A terminal, comprising a memory, a processor and a program for processing text information, wherein the program is stored on the memory, the processor is configured to execute the program to implement followings; determining a first pinyin string corresponding to text information; determining a first string set based on the first pinyin string, wherein the first string set comprises a plurality of first string elements; determining an index and an occurrence number, in a total string set, of each first string element; generating a pinyin hash vector based on the index and the occurrence number; and determining continuous features of the text information based on the pinyin hash vector and an embedded neural network.
6. The terminal according to claim 5, wherein the processor is configured to execute the program to determine the first string set by: determining the first string set by using a sliding window algorithm based on the first pinyin string, wherein the sliding window algorithm comprises a preset step length and a window size.
7. The terminal according to claim 5, wherein the processor is configured to execute the program to generate the total string set by: determining second pinyin strings of words in a dictionary; generating a second string element by adding placeholders before and after a second pinyin string for each of the words respectively; determining a second string set based on the second string element; and generating the total string set by uniting second string sets.
8. The terminal according to claim 5, wherein the processor is configured to execute the program to generate a pinyin hash vector by: generating a zero vector, wherein a dimension of the zero vector is equal to that of the total string set, determining a dimension, in the zero vector, of the index, generating the pinyin hash vector by adjusting a numerical value of the dimension as the occurrence number.
9. A computer readable storage medium, wherein the computer readable storage medium stores a program for processing text information, the program comprising sets of instructions for: determining a first pinyin string corresponding to text information; determining a first string set based on the first pinyin string, wherein the first string set comprises a plurality of first string elements; determining an index and an occurrence number of each first string element in a total string set; generating a pinyin hash vector based on the index and the occurrence number; and determining continuous features of the text information based on the pinyin hash vector and an embedded neural network.
10. The computer readable storage medium according to claim 9, wherein said determining the first string set, comprises: determining the first string set by using a sliding window algorithm based on the first pinyin string, wherein the sliding window algorithm comprises a preset step length and a window size.
11. The computer readable storage medium according to claim 9, wherein the program further comprises a set of instructions for: determining second pinyin strings of words in a dictionary; generating a second string element by adding placeholders before and after a second pinyin string for each of the words respectively; determining a second string set based on the second string element; and generating the total string set by uniting second string sets.
12. The computer readable storage medium according to claim 9, wherein said generating a pinyin hash vector, comprises: generating a zero vector, wherein a dimension of the zero vector is equal to that of the total string set; determining a dimension of the index in the zero vector; generating the pinyin hash vector by adjusting a numerical value of the dimension as the occurrence number.
