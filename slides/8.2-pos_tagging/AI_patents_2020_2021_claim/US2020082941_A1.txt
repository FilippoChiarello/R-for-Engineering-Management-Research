CARE PATH ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT PLATFORM
</title>

<abstract>
In some examples, a system may generate a plurality of care path patient profile models based on a plurality of care path patterns for a plurality of past patient admissions. For example, each care path patient profile model may include a trained classifier. Further, the system may receive information related to a new patient admission, and may generate features from the received information related to the new patient admission. The system may input the features generated from the received information related to the new patient admission into the plurality of care path patient profile models to obtain a respective probability of being classified in a respective care path based on an amount of similarity to the patients who have gone through each care path. In addition, the system may present, on a display, information related to at least one care path pattern in a graphical user interface.
