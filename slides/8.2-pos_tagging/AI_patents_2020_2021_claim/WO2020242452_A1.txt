METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR ENCODING IMAGES
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure is directed to encoding images. In particular, one or more computing devices can receive data representing one or more machine learning (ML) models configured, at least in part, to encode images comprising objects of a particular type. The computing device(s) can receive data representing an image comprising one or more objects of the particular type. The computing device(s) can generate, based at least in part on the data representing the image and the data representing the ML model(s), data representing an encoded version of the image that alters at least a portion of the image comprising the object(s) such that when the encoded version of the image is decoded, the object(s) are unrecognizable as being of the particular type by one or more object-recognition ML models based at least in part upon which the ML model(s) configured to encode the images were trained.
