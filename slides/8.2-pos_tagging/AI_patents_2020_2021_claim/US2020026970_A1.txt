<title>
System and method for processing character images and transforming font within a document
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to a system and method to transform character images from one representation to another representation. According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, a form may be processed to separate background data from content data, wherein character images from one or both the background data and the content data may be transformed. In some aspects, one or both handwritten font and type font may be processed in the character images, wherein the original fonts may be transformed into a uniform type font. In some embodiments, the character images may be translated to their correct state, wherein the translation may occur before or after the transformation. In some implementations, the translation and font transformation may allow for more efficient and effective character recognition.

<claims>
1. A process for processing character images within a form, the process comprising: receiving a form with data; analyzing the form and data through an artificial entity; identifying a plurality of character image elements within the data without requiring recognition of character images comprising the plurality of character image elements; and transforming at least a portion of the plurality of character image elements without requiring recognition of character images comprising the plurality of character image elements.
2. The process of claim 1, further comprising inpainting missing character image elements, wherein the inpainting increases a legibility of a character image comprising at least a portion of missing character image elements.
3. The process of claim 1, further comprising identifying at least a portion of the plurality of character image elements as one or more of content data, background data, and noise.
4. The process of claim 3, further comprising mapping relative locations of each of the plurality of character image elements within the form.
5. The process of claim 4, further comprising identifying correct relative locations of content data and background data, wherein correct relative locations of content data and background data increase effectiveness of recognition.
6. The process of claim 4, further comprising translating at least a portion of the plurality of character image elements.
7. The process of claim 6, wherein the translating comprises shifting at least a portion of the plurality of character image elements to correct relative locations within the form.
8. The process of claim 4, further comprising: removing content data from the form; and repopulating the content data with transformed character image elements.
9. The process of claim 1, wherein a plurality of character images comprises one or both a handwritten font or a typed font, wherein the plurality of character images comprises at least a portion of the character image elements.
10. The process of claim 9, further comprising identifying handwritten font and typed font.
11. The process of claim 10, wherein the identifying creates separable layers that, when separate, allows for increased recognition of at least a portion of one or both background data and content data.
12. The process of claim 1, wherein transforming changes at least a portion of the plurality of character image elements to one or more predefined transformed fonts.
13. The process of claim 12, wherein one or more predefined transformed fonts increase accuracy of character recognition.
14. A process for processing character images within a form, the process comprising: receiving a form with data; analyzing the form and data through an artificial entity; identifying a plurality of character image elements within the data without requiring recognition of character images comprising the plurality of character image elements; and translating at least a portion of the plurality of character image elements without requiring recognition of character images comprising the plurality of character image elements, wherein translating maps relative locations of each of the plurality of character image elements within the form.
15. The process of claim 14, further comprising identifying at least a portion of the plurality of character image elements as content data, background data, or both.
16. (canceled)
17. The process of claim 15, wherein translating identifies correct relative locations of content data and background data, wherein correct relative locations of content data and background data increase effectiveness of recognition.
18. The process of claim 14, wherein translating shifts at least a portion of the plurality of character image elements to correct relative locations within the form.
19. The process of claim 15, further comprising: removing content data from the form; and repopulating the content data with translated character image elements.
20. The process of claim 15, further comprising transforming at least a portion of the plurality of character image elements.
