<title>
SALIENCY-BASED OBJECT COUNTING AND LOCALIZATION
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems, and computer programs are presented for adding new features to a network service. An example method includes accessing an image from a user device to determine a salient object count of a plurality of objects in the image. A salient object count of the plurality of objects in the image is determined. An indicator of the salient object count of the plurality of objects in the image is caused to be displayed on the user device.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: determining, via hardware processing circuitry, a plurality of probability regions based on an image; determining, via the hardware processing circuitry, a count of a plurality of objects based on the plurality of probability regions; and causing display, on a device, of an indicator of the count of the plurality of objects.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining a heat map based on the image, the heat map indicating the plurality of probability regions.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining a plurality of peak probability regions based on the plurality of probability regions.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the determining of the count is based on the plurality of peak probability regions.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising defining bounding polygons determining portions of the image corresponding to the plurality of peak probability regions, wherein the determining of the count is based on the bounding polygons.
6. The method of claim 4, further comprising counting a total number of the plurality of peak probability regions, wherein the count is based on the total number.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising iteratively performing the determining of the plurality of probability regions and the count for a sequence of video frames.
8. A system, comprising: hardware processing circuitry; and one or more memories storing instructions that, when executed, configure the hardware processing circuitry to perform operations comprising: determining a plurality of probability regions based on an image; determining a count of a plurality of objects based on the plurality of probability regions; and causing display, on a device, of an indicator of the count of the plurality of objects.
9. The system of claim 8, the operations further comprising determining a heat map based on the image, the heat map indicating the plurality of probability regions.
10. The system of claim 8, the operations further comprising determining a plurality of peak probability regions based on the plurality of probability regions.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the determining of the count is based on the plurality of peak probability regions.
12. The system of claim 11, the operations further comprising defining bounding polygons determining portions of the image corresponding to the plurality of peak probability regions, wherein the determining of the count is based on the bounding polygons.
13. The system of claim 11, the operations further comprising counting a total number of the plurality of peak probability regions, wherein the count is based on the total number.
14. The system of claim 13, the operations further comprising iteratively performing the determining of the plurality of probability regions and the count for a sequence of video frames.
15. A non-transitory computer readable storage medium comprising instructions that, when executed, configure hardware processing circuitry to perform operations comprising: determining a plurality of probability regions based on an image; determining a count of a plurality of objects based on the plurality of probability regions; and causing display, on a device, of an indicator of the count of the plurality of objects.
16. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 15, the operations further comprise determining a heat map based on the image, the heat map indicating the plurality of probability regions.
17. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 15, the operations further comprising determining a plurality of peak probability regions based on the plurality of probability regions.
18. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein the determining of the count is based on the plurality of peak probability regions.
19. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 18, the operations further comprising defining bounding polygons determining portions of the image corresponding to the plurality of peak probability regions, wherein the determining of the count is based on the bounding polygons.
20. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 18, the operations further comprising counting a total number of the plurality of peak probability regions, wherein the count is based on the total number.
