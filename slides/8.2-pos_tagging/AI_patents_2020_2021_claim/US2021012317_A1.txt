MODULATING MOBILE-DEVICE DISPLAYS BASED ON AMBIENT SIGNALS TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF FRAUD
</title>

<abstract>
Provided is a process of classifying ambient signals to reduce fraudulent use of information, the process including: receiving, with the mobile computing device, from a remote server, balance-access information by which a stored value card balance can be spent at a point of sale terminal; storing, with the mobile computing device, the balance-access information; sensing, with one or more sensors of a mobile computing device, ambient signals; classifying the ambient signals as indicating the user is in a retail establishment; and in response to the classification, displaying, on a display screen of the mobile computing device, the balance-access information, such that the balance-access information can be input to a point-of-sale terminal.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A tangible, non-transitory machine-readable media storing instructions to classify ambient signals to reduce fraudulent use of stored value card information, wherein the instructions, when executed by one or more processors of a mobile computing device effectuate operations comprising: receiving, with the mobile computing device, from a remote server, balance-access information by which a stored value card balance can be spent at a point of sale terminal; storing, with the mobile computing device, the balance-access information; sensing, with one or more sensors of a mobile computing device, ambient signals; classifying the ambient signals as indicating the user is in a retail establishment; and in response to the classification, displaying, on a display screen of the mobile computing device, the balance-access information, such that the balance-access information can be input to a point-of-sale terminal.
2. The media of claim 1, wherein: sensing ambient signals comprises: sensing audio; sensing an image; sensing an orientation; and sensing a wireless beacon; and classifying the ambient signals as indicating the user is in a retail establishment comprises: calculating a score based on a weighted combination of a classification of the sensed audio, a classification of the image, a classification of the orientation, and a classification of the wireless beacon; and determining that the score satisfies a threshold.
3. The media of claim 1, comprising: determining a geolocation of the mobile computing device; requesting from a remote server parameters of an ambient signal classifier pertinent to the geolocation; receiving the parameters; and wherein classifying the ambient signals comprises classifying the ambient signals based on the parameters.
4. The media of claim 3, wherein determining a geolocation of the mobile computing device comprises: receiving an encrypted rolling code emitted by a wireless beacon; and validating that the encrypted rolling code corresponds to wireless beacon of a retailer.
5. The media of claim 1, wherein sensing ambient signals comprises sensing audio with a microphone of the mobile computing device.
6. The media of claim 5, wherein classifying the ambient signals comprises: normalizing the audio; extracting a feature vector from the normalized audio; and scoring the feature vector with a value indicating a likelihood of whether the user is in a retail establishment.
7. The media of claim 5, wherein classifying the ambient signals comprises: extracting a feature by passing a representation of the audio through a band-pass filter.
8. The media of claim 5, wherein classifying the ambient signals comprises: extracting a feature by determining a Fourier transform of a representation of the audio.
9. The media of claim 5, wherein the features comprise: an audio signal within a range of frequencies; and duration of the audio signals within the range of frequencies.
10. The media of claim 9, wherein the range of frequencies is selected from among a plurality of ranges of frequencies based on a geolocation sensed by the mobile computing device.
11. The media of claim 1, wherein sensing ambient signals comprises receiving a reading from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) of the mobile computing device.
12. The media of claim 11, wherein classifying the ambient signals comprises: determining an orientation of the mobile computing device with respect to gravity.
13. The media of claim 11, wherein classifying the ambient signals comprises: classifying a multi-dimensional time series of readings from the IMU as indicating a gesture.
14. The media of claim 13, wherein classifying a multi-dimensional time series of readings from the IMU as indicating a gesture comprises dynamic time warping the multi-dimensional time series.
15. The media of claim 1, wherein sensing, with one or more sensors of a mobile computing device, ambient signals comprises: sensing an image with a camera of the mobile computing device.
16. The media of claim 15, wherein classifying the ambient signals comprises: classifying the image as containing at least part of a point-of-sale terminal.
17. The media of claim 15, wherein classifying the ambient signals comprises: classifying the image as containing at least part of a point-of-sale terminal by detecting translation invariant features in the image corresponding to the point-of-sale terminal with a convolution layer of a neural network.
18. The media of claim 15, wherein classifying the ambient signals comprises: classifying two images from two cameras of the mobile computing device by determining that one image from a camera facing in a direction opposite the display screen contains the user's face, such that the display screen is oriented away from the user.
19. The media of claim 1, wherein classifying the ambient signals comprises performing steps for classifying the ambient signals.
20. The media of claim 1, wherein displaying, on a display screen of the mobile computing device, the balance-access information comprises: receiving an input from a touchscreen of the mobile computing device indicating a user input; in response to the user input, displaying the balance-access information; and determining that the user input has ceased and, in response, ceasing to display the balance access information.
