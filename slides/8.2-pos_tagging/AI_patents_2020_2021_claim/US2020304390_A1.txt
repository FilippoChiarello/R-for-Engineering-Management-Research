<title>
SYNTHETIC DATA FOR DETERMINING HEALTH OF A NETWORK SECURITY SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
An example method can include choosing a pattern or patterns of network traffic. This pattern can be representative of a certain type of traffic such as an attack. The pattern can be associated with various components of a network and can describe expected behavior of these various components. A system performing this method can then choose a nodes or nodes to generate traffic according to the pattern and send an instruction accordingly. After this synthetic traffic is generated, the system can compare the behavior of the components with the expected behavior. An alert can then be created to notify an administrator or otherwise remedy any problems.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: determining that a plurality of nodes of a network generate data corresponding to a pattern, the pattern associated with expected behavior of the plurality of nodes; causing each of the plurality of nodes to generate a portion of the data corresponding to the pattern; comparing actual behavior of the plurality of nodes with the expected behavior; and when the actual behavior does not correspond to the expected behavior, generating an alert that at least one of the plurality of nodes is non-conforming.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: capturing network traffic data and associated data using at least a first sensor of a first virtual machine of the network, a second sensor of a first server hosting the first virtual machine, and a third sensor of a first networking device connected to the first server; determining a plurality of patterns in the network traffic data and the associated data; and causing respective data corresponding to each of the plurality of patterns to be generated over a specified period of time.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, further comprising: selecting a random order for the respective data corresponding to each of the plurality of patterns to be generated from a configured set of patterns.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: selecting a port of at least one node of the plurality of nodes from which to generate a respective portion of the data corresponding to the pattern.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the pattern corresponds to at least one of a DDoS attack, a MAC address spoofing, a port knock, or normal traffic.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein a packet of the pattern includes a flag indicating the packet is a synthetic packet.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: when the actual behavior corresponds to the expected behavior, generating an alert that at least one of the plurality of nodes is conforming, wherein the alert that the plurality of nodes are conforming includes providing information to a presentation module.
8. A non-transitory computer-readable medium comprising instructions stored thereon that, when executed, cause a computing device to: determine a plurality of nodes of a network generate data corresponding to a pattern, the pattern associated with expected behavior of the plurality of nodes; cause each of the plurality of nodes to generate a portion of the data corresponding to the pattern; compare actual behavior of the plurality of nodes with the expected behavior; and when the actual behavior does not correspond to the expected behavior, generate an alert that at least one of the plurality of nodes is non-conforming.
9. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, comprising further instructions, which when executed, further cause the computing device to: capture network traffic data and associated data using at least a first sensor of a first virtual machine of the network, a second sensor of a first server hosting the first virtual machine, and a third sensor of a first networking device connected to the first server; determine a plurality of patterns in the network traffic data and the associated data; and cause respective data corresponding to each of the plurality of patterns to be generated over a specified period of time.
10. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 9, comprising further instructions, which when executed, further cause the computing device to: select a random order for the respective data corresponding to each of the plurality of patterns to be generated from a configured set of patterns
11. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, comprising further instructions, which when executed, further cause the computing device to: select a random port of at least one node of the plurality of nodes from which to generate a respective portion of the data corresponding to the pattern.
12. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein the pattern corresponds to at least one of a DDoS attack, a MAC address spoofing, or a port knock.
13. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, wherein a packet of the pattern includes a flag indicating that the packet is a synthetic packet.
14. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, comprising further instructions, which when executed, further cause the computing device to: when the actual behavior corresponds to the expected behavior, generate an alert that at least one of the plurality of nodes is conforming, wherein the alert that the plurality of nodes are conforming includes providing information to a presentation module.
15. A system comprising: a processor; and a memory including instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to: determine a plurality of nodes of a network generate data corresponding to a pattern, the pattern associated with expected behavior of the plurality of nodes; cause each of the plurality of nodes to generate a portion of the data corresponding to the pattern; compare actual behavior of the plurality of nodes with the expected behavior; and when the actual behavior does not correspond to the expected behavior, generate an alert that at least one of the plurality of nodes is non-conforming.
16. The system of claim 15, comprising further instructions, which when executed by the processor cause the processor to: capture network traffic data and associated data using at least a first sensor of a first virtual machine of the network, a second sensor of a first server hosting the first virtual machine, and a third sensor of a first networking device connected to the first server; determine a plurality of patterns in the network traffic data and the associated data; and cause respective data corresponding to each of the plurality of patterns to be generated over a specified period of time.
17. The system of claim 16, comprising further instructions, which when executed by the processor cause the processor to: select a random order for respective data corresponding to each of the plurality of patterns to be generated from a configured set of patterns.
18. The system of claim 15, comprising further instructions, which when executed by the processor cause the processor to: select a random port of at least one node of the plurality of nodes from which to generate a respective portion of the data corresponding to the pattern.
19. The system of claim 15, wherein the pattern corresponds to at least one of a DDoS attack, a MAC address spoofing, or a port knock.
20. The system of claim 15, comprising further instructions, which when executed by the processor cause the processor to: when the actual behavior corresponds to the expected behavior, generate an alert that at least one of the plurality of nodes is conforming, wherein the alert that the plurality of nodes are conforming includes providing information to a presentation module.
