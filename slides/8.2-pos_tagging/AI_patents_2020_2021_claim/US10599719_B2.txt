<title>
System and method for providing prediction-model-based generation of a graph data model
</title>

<abstract>
In some embodiments, templates related to each graph data model of a graph data model set for converting non-graph data representations in a non-graph database to graph data representations compatible with a graph database may be obtained. One or more templates and the non-graph data representations may be provided to a neural network for the neural network to predict additional templates. The additional templates may be provided to the neural network as reference feedback for the neural network's prediction of the additional templates to train the neural network. A collection of non-graph data representations from a given non-graph database may be provided to the neural network for the neural network to generate one or more templates for a given graph data model for converting non-graph data representations in the given non-graph database into graph data representations compatible with a given graph database.
