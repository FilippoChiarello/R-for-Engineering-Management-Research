<title>
Electric travelling vehicle and grass mower
</title>

<abstract>
An electric travelling vehicle including: a motor controller configured to control an electric motor based on displacement of a steering operation part to a forward travel position, a neutral position, and a rearward travel position, a brake controller configured to bring an electromagnetic power-off brake into a released state or a braking state; and a travel state detector configured to detect a travelling state that is accompanied with the released state, a stopped state that is accompanied with the braking state, and a transit stopped state that is accompanied with the braking state.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A grass mower comprising: a mower unit that includes a rotation shaft to which a cutter blade is attached, a mower motor, and a mower power transmission mechanism that establishes a power transmission path through which power from the mower motor is transmitted to the cutter blade; a mower motor controller configured to control the mower motor; a mower drive state detector configured to detect a drive state of the mower motor; and a mower abnormality detector configured to detect an abnormality in the power transmission path based on a detection signal from the mower drive state detector; and a manual operation part configured to provide the mower motor controller with a drive instruction that is an instruction to drive the mower motor and a stop instruction that is an instruction to stop the mower motor from driving, wherein the mower motor controller forcibly stops the mower motor upon the mower motor abnormality detector detecting the abnormality, and wherein, when the mower motor is to be recovered from a forcibly stopped state, the stop instruction and the drive instruction that is subsequent to the stop instruction are required to be provided from the manual operation part.
2. A grass mower comprising: a mower unit that includes a rotation shaft to which a cutter blade is attached, a mower motor, and a mower power transmission mechanism that establishes a power transmission path through which power from the mower motor is transmitted to the cutter blade; a mower motor controller configured to control the mower motor; and a mower drive state detector configured to detect a drive state of the mower motor; and a mower abnormality detector configured to detect an abnormality in the power transmission path based on a detection signal from the mower drive state detector; wherein the mower motor is supplied with power via an inverter, the mower drive state detector includes a current detector that is built into the inverter and is configured to detect a current value of the mower motor, and the mower abnormality detector detects an abnormality in the mower unit upon the current value falling below a predetermined value while the mower unit is driving.
3. The grass mower according to claim 2, wherein the mower abnormality detector detects, as an abnormality in the power transmission path, a power transmission failure in the mower power transmission mechanism or an attachment failure in which the cutter blade and the rotation shaft are improperly attached to each other, upon the current value falling below the predetermined value while the mower unit is driving.
