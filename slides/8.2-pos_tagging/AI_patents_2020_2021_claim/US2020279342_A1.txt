COMPUTER PLATFORMS DESIGNED FOR IMPROVED ELECTRONIC EXECUTION OF ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
In order to facilitate secure and confidential electronic exchanges, systems and methods include establishing an electronic communication session based on participation levels controlled by a stack software object such that each invitee computing device associated with each invitee is prevented from accessing activities in the electronic communication session unless the invitee satisfies first predetermined parameters based on a locked stack participation level; an initiating computing device associated with the initiating user is enabled to access the electronic communication setting at a reserve level while each invitee computing device is prevented from accessing the activities in the electronic communication session unless the invitee satisfies second predetermined parameters based on an unlocked stack participation level; and the initiating computing device and each invitee computing device are enabled to access the activities in the electronic communication session based on an open stack participation level.

<claims>
What is claims is:
1. A method comprising: receiving, by at least one processor, a session request from an initiating user; wherein the session request comprises an electronic communication session over a cloud computing network for a transfer of a quantity of a position in at least one financial instrument from the initiating user to at least one session invitee; generating, by the at least one processor, a list of potential intermediate entities based at least in part on a respective dealer liquidity score associated with each potential intermediate entity of the potential intermediate entities; receiving, by the at least one processor, a selection from the initiating user identifying a selected intermediate entity of the potential intermediate entities to mediate the electronic communication session; enabling, by the at least one processor, the initiating user and the selected intermediate entity to negotiate attributes of the electronic communication session; generating, by the at least one processor, based on the attributes of the electronic communication session, a stack software object controlling a plurality of participation levels in the electronic communication session for each selected invitee of a set of selected invitees; wherein the plurality of participation levels comprises: i) a locked stack participation level, ii) an unlocked stack participation level, and iii) an open stack participation level; receiving, by the at least one processor, an invitee selection from the selected intermediate entity indicating the set of selected invitees selected from a plurality of potential invitees; establishing, by the at least one processor, the electronic communication session, associated with an intermediary computing device of the selected intermediate entity; wherein the electronic communication session comprises the stack software object; preventing, by the at least one processor, a respective invitee computing device associated with each respective selected invitee from accessing activities in the electronic communication session unless the respective selected invitee satisfies at least one first predetermined parameter based on the locked stack participation level of the stack software object; enabling, by the at least one processor, an initiating computing device associated with the initiating user to access in the electronic communication setting at a reserve level while preventing each respective invitee computing device associated with each respective selected invitee from accessing the activities in the electronic communication session unless the respective selected invitee satisfies at least one second predetermined parameter based on the unlocked stack participation level of the stack software object; and enabling, by the at least one processor, the initiating computing device associated with the initiating user and each respective invitee computing device associated with each respective selected invitee to access the activities in the electronic communication session based on the open stack participation level of the stack software object.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the dealer liquidity score comprises a calculated score assigned to each potential intermediate entity for the electronic communication session based at least in part on historical trading data of related financial instruments to the at least one financial instrument;
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising generating, by the at least one processor, an alert to a respective user computing associated with each respective selected invitee of the selected invitees to enable each respective selected invitee to join the electronic communication session according to the plurality of participation levels.
4. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein a dealer selection GUI further enable the selected intermediate entity to buy the at least a portion of the quantity of the position in the at least one financial instrument from the initiating user prior to the electronic communication session.
5. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the stack software object provides options for each selected invitee of the set of selected invitees to submit respective trade parameters comprising a respective size and a respective level of a respective portion of the position in the at least one financial instrument.
6. The method as recited in claim 5, wherein the stack software object prevents each selected invitee of the set of selected invitees to submit respective trade parameters having lesser value than previously submitted trade parameters.
7. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the stack software object is configured to anonymize each selected invitee in the electronic communication session.
8. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein the electronic communication session remains active until the quantity of the position in the at least one financial instrument is fully allocated.
9. The method as recited in claim 1, wherein a computing device associated with one or more of: the initiating user, the selected intermediate user and the set of selected invitees, interfaces with the electronic communication session using an application programming interface (API).
10. The method as recited in claim 1, further comprising: utilizing, by the at least one processor, a liquidity analytical model to predict a respective value indicative of a respective expected level of interest for each respective potential invitee of a plurality of potential invitees based on characteristics of the at least one financial instrument and transaction histories of each potential invitee; wherein each respective expected level of interest comprises a respective probability of each respective potential invitee to execute a trade of a financial instrument having common attributes to the at least one financial instrument; and ranking, by the at least one processor, the plurality of potential invitees according to each respective value indicative of the respective expected level of interest.
11. A system comprising: at least one processor configured to: receive a session request from an initiating user; wherein the session request comprises an electronic communication session over a cloud computing network for a transfer of a quantity of a position in at least one financial instrument from the initiating user to at least one session invitee; generate a list of potential intermediate entities based at least in part on a respective dealer liquidity score associated with each potential intermediate entity of the potential intermediate entities; receive a selection from the initiating user identifying a selected intermediate entity of the potential intermediate entities to mediate the electronic communication session; enable the initiating user and the selected intermediate entity to negotiate attributes of the electronic communication session; generate based on the attributes of the electronic communication session, a stack software object controlling a plurality of participation levels in the electronic communication session for each selected invitee of a set of selected invitees; wherein the plurality of participation levels comprises: i) a locked stack participation level, ii) an unlocked stack participation level, and iii) an open stack participation level; receive an invitee selection from the selected intermediate entity indicating the set of selected invitees selected from a plurality of potential invitees; establish the electronic communication session, associated with an intermediary computing device of the selected intermediate entity; wherein the electronic communication session comprises the stack software object; prevent a respective invitee computing device associated with each respective selected invitee from accessing activities in the electronic communication session unless the respective selected invitee satisfies at least one first predetermined parameter based on the locked stack participation level of the stack software object; enable an initiating computing device associated with the initiating user to access in the electronic communication setting at a reserve level while preventing each respective invitee computing device associated with each respective selected invitee from accessing the activities in the electronic communication session unless the respective selected invitee satisfies at least one second predetermined parameter based on the unlocked stack participation level of the stack software object; and enable the initiating computing device associated with the initiating user and each respective invitee computing device associated with each respective selected invitee to access the activities in the electronic communication session based on the open stack participation level of the stack software object.
