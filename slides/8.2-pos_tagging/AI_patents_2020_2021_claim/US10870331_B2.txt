<abstract>
Systems and methods for managing an environment comfort system includes a control system. The control system is communicatively coupled to a location positioning system. The control system is structured to determine a first time parameter corresponding to a vehicle proximate to a path location, determine a second time parameter corresponding to a path schedule, determine a stop duration corresponding to the vehicle based, at least in part, on the first time parameter and the second time parameter, and generate a command structured to manage an environment comfort system in response to movement of the one or more vehicle components between a current performance level and an adjusted performance level based on the stop duration determined.

<claims>
1. A controller structured to: determine a first time parameter corresponding to a vehicle proximate to a path location, wherein the vehicle comprises one or more vehicle components; and determine a second time parameter corresponding to a path schedule; determine a stop duration corresponding to the vehicle based on the first time parameter and the second time parameter, the stop duration being a time duration occurring when the vehicle stops and an engine of the vehicle continues to run; and adjust an operating parameter of an environment comfort system in response to movement of the one or more vehicle components between a current performance level and an adjusted performance level based on the stop duration determined.
2. The controller of claim 1, wherein the controller is communicatively coupled to a location positioning system, and wherein the location positioning system is structured to provide path location data.
3. The controller of claim 2, wherein the location positioning system is structured to determine at least one of the first time parameter or the second time parameter.
4. The controller of claim 1, wherein the first time parameter comprises an arrival time and the second time parameter comprises a departure time.
5. The controller of claim 1, wherein the controller is further structured to generate a path pattern according to at least one of the path location or the path schedule associated with the vehicle comprising the one or more vehicle components.
6. The controller of claim 1, wherein the one or more vehicle components comprises at least one of an engine system, energy storage system, auxiliary power system, or aftertreatment device.
7. The controller of claim 1, wherein the controller is further structured to: determine a path interference event; and manage the environment comfort system in response to movement of the one or more vehicle components between the current performance level and the adjusted performance level based on the path interference event determined.
8. The controller of claim 1, wherein conserved electrical energy is converted to manage the environment comfort system.
9. The controller of claim 1, wherein the controller is further structured to determine one or more parameters associated with the one or more vehicle components, and wherein the one or more parameters comprises at least one of an ambient temperature, cabin temperature, or aftertreatment device temperature.
10. The controller of claim 1, wherein the vehicle comprises at least one of an on-road vehicle or off-road vehicle.
11. A method for managing an environment comfort system, the method comprising: determining, by a controller, a path interference event corresponding to a vehicle comprising an environment comfort system; adjust, by the controller, an operating parameter of the environment comfort system in response to movement of the one or more vehicle components between a current performance level and an adjusted performance level based on the path interference event determined; and communicatively coupling to a location positioning system, the location positioning system structured to provide path location data and determine at least one of a first time parameter corresponding to the vehicle proximate to a path location and a second time parameter corresponding to a path schedule, the first time parameter comprising an arrival time and the second time parameter comprising a departure time.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the method further comprises generating a path pattern according to at least one of the path location or path schedule associated with the vehicle comprising the one or more vehicle components.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the one or more vehicle components comprises at least one of an engine system, energy storage system, auxiliary power system, or aftertreatment device.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein conserved electrical energy is converted to manage the environment comfort system.
15. The method of claim 11, further comprising determining one or more parameters associated with the one or more vehicle components of the vehicle, and wherein the one or more parameters comprises at least one of an ambient temperature, cabin temperature, or aftertreatment device temperature.
16. A system comprising: a control system communicatively coupled to a location positioning system, the control system including a controller structured to: determine a first time parameter corresponding to a vehicle proximate to a path location; and determine a second time parameter corresponding to a path schedule; determine a stop duration corresponding to the vehicle based on the first time parameter and the second time parameter, the stop duration being a time duration occurring when the vehicle stops and an engine of the vehicle continues to run; and adjust an operation parameter of an environment comfort system in response to movement of one or more vehicle components between a current performance level and an adjusted performance level based on the stop duration determined.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein the control system is further structured to generate a path pattern according to at least one of the path location or the path schedule associated with the vehicle.
18. The system of claim 16, wherein the one or more vehicle components comprises at least one of an engine system, energy storage system, auxiliary power system, or aftertreatment device.
