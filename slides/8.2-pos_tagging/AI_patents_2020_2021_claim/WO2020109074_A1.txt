METHOD FOR DECREASING UNCERTAINTY IN MACHINE LEARNING MODEL PREDICTIONS
</title>

<abstract>
Described herein is a method for quantifying uncertainty in parameterized (e.g., machine learning) model predictions. The method comprises causing a parameterized model to predict multiple posterior distributions from the parameterized model for a given input. The multiple posterior distributions comprise a distribution of distributions. The method comprises determining a variability of the predicted multiple posterior distributions for the given input by sampling from the distribution of distributions; and using the determined variability in the predicted multiple posterior distributions to quantify uncertainty in the parameterized model predictions. The parameterized model comprises encoder-decoder architecture. The method comprises using the determined variability in the predicted multiple posterior distributions to adjust the parameterized model to decrease the uncertainty of the parameterized model for predicting wafer geometry, overlay, and/or other information as part of a semiconductor manufacturing process.
