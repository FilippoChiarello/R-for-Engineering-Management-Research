SMART HOME AIR CONDITIONER AUTOMATIC CONTROL SYSTEM BASED ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
</title>

<abstract>
There are provided an air conditioner automatic control method, an air conditioner automatic control apparatus, a recording medium, and an air conditioner. The air conditioner automatic control method receives occupancy detection data indicating whether a user occupies a room, receives temperature data and humidity data indicating indoor temperature and humidity, predicts future occupancy probability information of the user by using the occupancy detection data, derives an optimal PMV by using the temperature data and the humidity data, and calculates an optimal temperature by using the optimal PMV, and controls the air conditioner based on the occupancy detection data, the future occupancy probability, and the optimal temperature. Accordingly, the air conditioner can be driven at the optimal temperature suitable for the user.
