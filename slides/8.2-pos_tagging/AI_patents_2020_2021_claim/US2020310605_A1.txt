COMPUTING DEVICE WITH AN APPROPRIATE ADAPTABLE USER HARDWARE INTERFACE
</title>

<abstract>
A computing device includes at least one processor. The computing device also includes a memory, wherein the memory includes instructions that causes the at least one processor to perform operations. The operations include detecting at least one device connected to the computing device, selecting a user interface based on the at least one device; and displaying the user interface on a display associated with the computing device.

<claims>
1. A computing device comprising: at least one processor; and a memory, wherein the memory includes instructions that causes the at least one processor to perform action comprising: detecting at least one device connected to the computing device; selecting a user interface based on the at least one device; and displaying the user interface on a display associated with the computing device.
2. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the user interface is selected from a plurality of different user interfaces.
3. The computer device of claim 2, wherein the plurality of different user interfaces includes at least a PDA type user interface, and a workstation type user interface.
4. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the detecting and selecting are performed by an appropriate adaptive user interface display manager.
5. The computing device of claim 1, wherein the at least one device is at least one of a mouse, a pointing input device, a monitor, a projector, a television, a monitor type device, a keyboard device, a game controller, and an input device.
6. The computing device of claim 1 further comprising: a data store, the data store storing records identifying devices and corresponding user interfaces; and wherein selecting a user interface comprises accessing the data store.
7. A computer-implemented method comprising: detecting at least one device connected to a computing device; selecting a user interface based on the at least one device; and displaying the user interface on a display associated with the computer-device.
8. The computer-implemented method of claim 7, wherein the user interface is selected from a plurality of different user interfaces.
9. The computer device of claim 8, wherein the plurality of different user interfaces includes at least a PDA type user interface, and a workstation type user interface.
10. The computer-implemented method of claim 7, wherein the detecting and selecting are performed by an appropriate adaptive user interface display manager.
11. The computer-implemented method of claim 7, the at least one device is at least one of a mouse, a pointing input device, a monitor, a projector, a television, a monitor type device, a keyboard device, a game controller, and an input device.
12. The computer-implemented method of claim 7 wherein selecting the user interface comprises accessing the data store, the data store storing records identifying devices and corresponding user interfaces; and wherein selecting.
13. A non-transitory computer readable medium storing instructions that when executed cause a processor to perform operations comprising: detecting at least one device connected to a computing device; selecting a user interface based on the at least one device; and displaying the user interface on a display associated with the computer-device.
14. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 7, wherein the user interface is selected from a plurality of different user interfaces.
15. The computer device of claim 14, wherein the plurality of different user interfaces includes at least a PDA type user interface, and a workstation type user interface.
16. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 7, wherein the detecting and selecting are performed by an appropriate adaptive user interface display manager.
17. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 7, wherein the at least one device is at least one of a mouse, a pointing input device, a monitor, a projector, a television, a monitor type device, a keyboard device, a game controller, and an input device.
18. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 7 wherein selecting the user interface comprises accessing the data store, the data store storing records identifying devices and corresponding user interfaces; and wherein selecting.
