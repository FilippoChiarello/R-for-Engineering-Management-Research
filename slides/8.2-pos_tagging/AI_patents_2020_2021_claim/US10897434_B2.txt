<title>
Processing system performing dynamic training response output generation control
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the disclosure relate to enhanced dynamic training response output generation control systems with enhanced dynamic training response output determinations. A computing platform may receive, from the user device and in response to an initial dynamic training interface, a training request input. The computing platform may send, to an NLU engine, the training request input and commands directing the NLU engine to perform natural language understanding and processing on the training request input to determine a natural language result output. Using the natural language result output, the computing platform may determine third party data sources that correspond to the natural language result output, and may request source data from the third party data sources. Using the source data and the natural language result output, the computing platform may generate a dynamic training response output, and may direct the user device to cause display of the dynamic training response output.
