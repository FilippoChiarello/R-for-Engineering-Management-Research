OPEN VS ENCLOSED SPATIAL ENVIRONMENT CLASSIFICATION FOR A MOBILE OR WEARABLE DEVICE USING MICROPHONE AND DEEP LEARNING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A method and apparatus for classifying a spatial environment as open or enclosed are provided. In the method and apparatus, one or more microphones (102) detect ambient sound in a spatial environment and output an audio signal representative of the ambient sound. A processor (104) determines a spatial environment impulse response (SEIR) for the audio signal and extracts one or more features of the SEIR. The processor classifies the spatial environment as open or enclosed based on the one or more features of the SEIR.

<claims>
1. 1. A method for open or enclosed spatial environment classification, comprising: detecting by, one or more microphones (102), ambient sound in a spatial environment; outputting, to a processor (104), an audio signal representative of the ambient sound; determining, by the processor, a spatial environment impulse response (SEIR) for the audio signal; extracting one or more features of the SEIR; and classifying, by a pattern classifier executed by the processor, the spatial environment as open or enclosed based on the one or more features of the SEIR.
2. 2. The method of claim 1, comprising: determining the SEIR by at least: performing a deconvolution on the audio signal; and determining a cepstrum for the deconvoluted audio signal; augmenting the one or more features of the SEIR with features extracted from Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), delta MFCCs or double delta MFCC to form a composite vector; and classifying the spatial environment as open or enclosed based on the composite vector.
3. 2. The method of claim 2, comprising:
performing cepstral mean subtraction on the features extracted from the MFCC, delta MFCC or double delta MFCC to reduce mismatch between training and testing conditions.
4. 4. The method of any of claims 1-3, wherein classifying the spatial environment as open or enclosed includes identifying a type of the spatial environment as office, home, mall, supermarket, street, stadium, beach or nature.
5. 5. The method of claim 1, comprising: dividing the audio signal into a plurality of frames; determining an energy ratio for each frame of the plurality of frames; selecting, from the plurality of frames, a set of frames having respective energy ratios that meet a criterion; performing exponential windowing on the set of frames to minimize phase; determining a cepstrum for the set of frames; and performing inverse exponential windowing on the set of frames.
6. 6. The method of any of claims 1-5, wherein extracting the one or more features of the SEIR includes: obtaining a first SEIR feature of the one or more features as energy of multiple bands of initial samples of the SEIR; and obtaining a second SEIR feature of the one or more features as an average of maxima indices of SEIR magnitude.
7. 7. The method of claim 6, wherein extracting the one or more features of the SEIR includes: obtaining a third SEIR feature of the one or more features as a time kurtosis of the SEIR; obtaining a fourth SEIR feature of the one or more features as a spectral standard deviation at a center frequency of the SEIR; and obtaining a fifth SEIR feature of the one or more features as a slope of samples of the SEIR.
8. 8. A device, comprising: one or more microphones (102) configured to: detect ambient sound in a spatial environment; and output an audio signal representative of the ambient sound; and a processor (100) configured to: receive the audio signal representative of the ambient sound; determine a spatial environment impulse response (SEIR) for the audio signal; extract one or more features of the SEIR; and classify the spatial environment as open or enclosed based on the one or more features of the SEIR.
9. 9. The device of claim 8, wherein the processor (100) is configured to: determine the SEIR by at least: performing a deconvolution on the audio signal; and determining a cepstrum for the deconvoluted audio signal; augment the one or more features of the SEIR with features extracted from Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), delta MFCCs or double delta MFCC to form a composite vector; and classify the spatial environment as open or enclosed based on the composite vector.
10. 10. The device of claim 9, wherein the processor (100) is configured to:
perform cepstral mean subtraction on the features extracted from the MFCC, delta MFCC or double delta MFCC to reduce mismatch between training and testing conditions.
11. 11. The device of any of claims 8-10, wherein classifying the spatial environment as open or enclosed includes identifying a type of the spatial environment as office, home, mall, supermarket, street, stadium, beach or nature.
12. 12. The device of claim 8, wherein the processor (100) is configured to: divide the audio signal into a plurality of frames; determine an energy ratio for each frame of the plurality of frames; select, from the plurality of frames, a set of frames having respective energy ratios that meet a criterion; perform exponential windowing on the set of frames to minimize phase; determine a cepstrum for the set of frames; and perform inverse exponential windowing on the set of frames.
13. 13. The device of any of claims 8-12, wherein the processor (100) is configured to extract the one or more features of the SEIR by: obtaining a first SEIR feature of the one or more features as energy of multiple bands of initial samples of the SEIR; and obtaining a second SEIR feature of the one or more features as an average of maxima indices of SEIR magnitude.
14. 14. The device of claim 13, wherein the processor (100) is configured to extract the one or more features of the SEIR by: obtaining a third SEIR feature of the one or more features as a time kurtosis of the SEIR; obtaining a fourth SEIR feature of the one or more features as a spectral standard deviation at a center frequency of the SEIR; and obtaining a fifth SEIR feature of the one or more features as a slope of samples of the SEIR.
