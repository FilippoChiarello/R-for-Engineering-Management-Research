METHOD FOR TRAINING MACHINE LEARNING MODEL TO DETERMINE OPTICAL PROXIMITY CORRECTION FOR MASK
</title>

<abstract>
Described herein are training methods and a mask correction method. One of the methods is for training a machine learning model configured to predict a post optimal proximity correction (OPC) image for a mask. The method involves obtaining (i) a pre-OPC image associated with a design layout to be printed on a substrate, (ii) an image of one or more assist features for the mask associated with the design layout, and (iii) a reference post- OPC image of the design layout; and training the machine learning model using the pre-OPC image and the image of the one or more assist features as input such that a difference between the reference image and a predicted post-OPC image of the machine learning model is reduced.

1. A method of training a machine learning model configured to predict a post optimal proximity correction (OPC) image for a mask, the method comprising:
obtaining (i) a pre-OPC image associated with a design layout to be printed on a substrate, (ii) an image of one or more assist features for the mask associated with the design layout, and (iii) a reference post-OPC image of the design layout; and
training, by a hardware computer, the machine learning model using the pre-OPC image and the image of the one or more assist features as input such that a difference between the reference image and a predicted post-OPC image of the machine learning model is reduced.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the obtaining of the pre-OPC image and the image of the one or more assist features comprises:
obtaining geometric shapes of the design layout and the one or more assist features; and
generating, via image processing, the pre-OPC image from the geometric shapes of the design layout and another image from geometric shapes of the one or more assist features.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the image processing comprises a rasterization operation based on the geometric shapes.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the obtaining of the geometric shapes of the one or more assist features comprises:
determining, via a rule-based approach, the geometric shapes of one or more assist features associated with the design layout; and/or
determining, via a model-based approach, geometric shapes of one or more assist features associated with the design layout.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the obtaining of the reference image comprises:
performing a mask optimization process and/or a source mask optimization process using the design layout.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the mask optimization process employs optical proximity correction process.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the training of the machine learning model is an iterative process, an iteration comprises:
inputting the pre-OPC image and the image of the one or more assist features to the machine learning model;
predicting the post-OPC image by simulating the machine learning model;
determining the difference between the predicted post-OPC image and the reference image; and
adjusting weights of the machine learning model such that the difference between the predicted and reference images is reduced.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the adjusting the weights is based on a gradient decent of the difference.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the difference is minimized.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
obtaining geometric shapes of the design layout;
dissecting the geometric shapes of the design layout into a plurality of segments; and determining corrections to the plurality of segments such that a difference between an image associated with the design layout and the predicted post-OPC image along the geometric shapes is reduced.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising:
placing one or more evaluation points on each segment of a plurality of segments.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein the determining of the corrections is an iterative process, an iteration comprising:
adjusting the plurality of segments of the geometric shapes;
generating an image from the adjusted geometric shapes of the design layout; and evaluating the difference between the generated image and the predicted post-OPC image along the geometric shapes within the respective images.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the difference between the generated and predicted images is a difference in intensity values along the geometric shapes, and/or
wherein the adjusting the plurality of the segments comprises:
adjusting shape and/or position of at least a portion of the plurality of segments such that the difference between the generated and predicted images is reduced.
14. The method of claim 12, wherein the difference between the generated image and the predicted post-OPC image is minimized. 15. A computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable medium having instructions recorded thereon, the instructions when executed by a computer implementing the method of claim 1.
