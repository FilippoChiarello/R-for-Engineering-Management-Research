CHECK SYSTEM OF A PROCESS SUBJECT TO EXECUTION RULES
</title>

<abstract>
A check procedure of a production process of an artifact (6), wherein image acquisition means (4) acquire 2D and 3D images from a work area (1). Said images are processed in an analysis check (100), using neural networks, to extract data that are sent to a check cycle (300) that checks said data in order to inform alarm situations by means of signaling means (5).

<claims>
1. Check procedure of a production process of a product (6) comprising the following steps: - definition of a job that comprises a plurality of tasks; - identification of a work area (1) wherein the product (6) is to be produced; - allocation of passive elements (P) comprising components (C1, C2, C3) and tools (T1, T2, T3) for producing the product (6) in the work area (1); - provision of image acquisition means (4) suitable for acquiring 2D images (F) and 3D images (G) in the work area (1) wherein said passive elements (P) are picked out by at least one actor (A1, A2) for producing the product; - creation of interference areas (101) in the 2D images (F) around each passive element (P) and around the product (6), - extraction of a movement map (101) from the 2D images (F) wherein areas with movement are identified; - excitation (103) of the passive elements (P), the interference areas of the passive elements (P) interfering with the areas with movement in such a way to obtain a movement map with excited elements (F3); - neural analysis (104) of the movement map with excited elements (F3) in order to identify the actors (A1, A2) in the movement map with excited elements; - extraction of a 3D coordinate map (105) from the 3D images (G) in such a way to obtain a 3D coordinate map (G1); - actor localization (106) based on the results (F4) of the neural analysis (104) and on the 3D coordinate map (G1) to find the position (H) of the actors in a 3D space; - queuing of the position of the actors in a 3D space in a queue (200); - picking-out check (301) to check that all the passive elements (P) have been picked out by the actors (A1, A2) based on the task to be executed; - if not all the passive elements have been picked out, an excitation check (302) is executed for each passive element (P) to check whether the passive element is in excitation; - if the passive element (P) is in excitation, a collision check (303) is executed to check whether the passive element is in collision with another element; if a passive element is in collision with another element, an alarm signal is transmitted to signaling means (5); - if all the passive elements have been picked out, a deposition check (304) is performed to check whether all the tools (T1, T2, T3) have been deposited in their initial position; if not all the tools have been deposited in their initial position within a preset time, an alarm signal is transmitted to the signaling means (5); - after depositing all the tools, a time check (305) is executed to check the execution time of the task; if the execution time of the task is lower than a preset threshold value, the task is considered to be concluded, otherwise an alarm signal is transmitted to the signaling means (5).
2. The procedure of claim 1, also comprising a consistency check step (107) to check whether a position of an actor acquired in a given moment is consistent with the sequence of preceding positions, analyzing the trajectory followed by the actor during its movement.
