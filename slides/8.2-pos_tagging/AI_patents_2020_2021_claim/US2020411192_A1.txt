DISEASE VULNERABILITY PREDICTION USING CONTEXTUAL DEVICES
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems for visually disease vulnerability prediction using contextual devices are disclosed. A computer-implemented method includes: determining, by a computing device, information about a patient including a current disease and contextual parameters; determining, by the computing device, a vulnerability score indicating a predicted vulnerability of the patient to at least one associated disease, based on the information about the patient; determining, by the computing device, a surrounding context for the patient, based on the information about the patient; and determining, by the computing device, a treatment for the patient, based on the information about the patient.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: determining, by a computing device, information about a patient including a current disease and contextual parameters; determining, by the computing device, a vulnerability score indicating a predicted vulnerability of the patient to at least one associated disease, based on the information about the patient; determining, by the computing device, a surrounding context for the patient, based on the information about the patient; and determining, by the computing device, a treatment for the patient, based on the information about the patient.
2. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the contextual parameters include physiological indicators for the patient.
3. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the contextual parameters include psychological attributes and insights for the patient.
4. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the contextual parameters include past history for the patient.
5. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the determining the surrounding context for the patient comprises determining a surrounding context to be adopted and a surrounding context to be avoided.
6. The computer-implemented method according to claim 5, wherein the surrounding context includes a geographic location.
7. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the determining the treatment for the patient comprises determining a treatment to be adopted and a treatment to be avoided.
8. A computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by a computing device to cause the computing device to: determine diseases from a plurality of diseases that commonly occur together using clustering; determine individual risk factors of each of the plurality of diseases using a data pipeline; determine common risk factors of the plurality of diseases; and determine a probability of two diseases occurring together in a patient using the determined diseases that commonly occur together, the determined individual risk factors, and the determined common risk factors.
9. The computer program product according to claim 8, wherein the determining the diseases from the plurality of diseases that commonly occur together comprises finding clusters between contextual parameters and the diseases.
10. The computer program product according to claim 9, wherein the contextual parameters include physiological indicators for the patient.
11. The computer program product according to claim 9, wherein the contextual parameters include psychological attributes and insights for the patient.
12. The computer program product according to claim 9, wherein the contextual parameters include past history for the patient.
13. The computer program product according to claim 9, wherein the determining the individual risk factors comprises using a logistic model formula to determine a probability of a selected disease as a function of a value of the contextual parameters.
14. The computer program product according to claim 13, wherein the logistic model formula is
15. A system comprising: a hardware processor, a computer readable memory, and a computer readable storage medium associated with a computing device; program instructions to determine information about a patient including a current disease and contextual parameters; program instructions to determine a vulnerability score indicating a predicted vulnerability of the patient to at least one associated disease, based on the information about the patient; program instructions to determine a surrounding context for the patient, based on the information about the patient; and program instructions to determine a treatment for the patient, based on the information about the patient, wherein the program instructions are stored on the computer readable storage medium for execution by the hardware processor via the computer readable memory.
16. The system according to claim 15, wherein the contextual parameters include physiological indicators for the patient.
17. The system according to claim 15, wherein the contextual parameters include psychological attributes and insights for the patient.
18. The system according to claim 15, wherein the contextual parameters include past history for the patient.
19. The system according to claim 15, wherein the determining the surrounding context for the patient comprises determining a surrounding context to be adopted and a surrounding context to be avoided.
20. The system according to claim 15, wherein the determining the treatment for the patient comprises determining a treatment to be adopted and a treatment to be avoided.
