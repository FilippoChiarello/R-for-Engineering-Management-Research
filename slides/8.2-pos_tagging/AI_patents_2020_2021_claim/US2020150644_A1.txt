METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR DETERMINING A NORMALIZED SEVERITY MEASURE OF AN IMPACT OF VIBRATION OF A COMPONENT OF AN INDUSTRIAL MACHINE USING THE INDUSTRIAL INTERNET OF THINGS
</title>

<abstract>
An industrial machine predictive maintenance system and method for determining a normalized severity measure of an impact of vibration of a component of an industrial machine. Vibration data can be captured from at least one vibration sensor disposed to capture vibration of a portion of an industrial machine and a frequency, a peak amplitude and gravitational force of the captured vibration can be determined. A frequency range-specific segment of a multi-segment vibration frequency spectra that bounds the captured vibration based on the determined frequency can be determined, and a vibration severity level for the captured vibration data can be determined based on the determined segment and at least one of the peak amplitude and the gravitational force. A signal in a predictive maintenance circuit for executing a maintenance action on the portion of the industrial machine based on the vibration severity level can be generated.
