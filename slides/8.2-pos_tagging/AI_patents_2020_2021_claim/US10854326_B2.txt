Systems and methods for full body circulation and drug concentration prediction
</title>

<abstract>
A method for predicting drug concentration levels includes receiving at least one subject characteristic of the subject, and executing a full body circulation model by: determining a first concentration of the drug in a first blood flow entering a first organ determining a second concentration of the drug in the first organ, determining a third concentration of a drug in a third blood flow entering a second organ, the third blood flow downstream of the first organ, and determining, using the second organ model a fourth concentration of the drug in the second organ.
