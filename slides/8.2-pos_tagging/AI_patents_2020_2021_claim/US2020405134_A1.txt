<title>
SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DETECTING DEFECTS IN MEDICAL DEVICES
</title>

<abstract>
Consistent with the present disclosure, a detection system is adapted to perform methods for detecting defects in medical devices, during a reprocessing procedure, for example. The detection system may utilize computer-implemented instructions to determine the presence and nature of the defects, whether biological or mechanical, for example. The computer-implemented instructions may be adapted to include artificial intelligence and/or machine learning algorithms, and process image data from currently available digital inspection camera systems or proprietary camera systems, as desired. Upon identification of a defect present in a medical device, the detection system may notify users of the presence of the defect, as well as provide further recommended action to be taken regarding the medical device, if desirable, reducing potential instrument failure, patient injury or death. The disclosed detection system may be integrated into existing disinfection and sterilization systems currently used in medical facilities, such as hospitals and surgery centers, for example.

<claims>
1. A method for detecting defects of a medical device, comprising: obtaining procedural data related to the medical device; positioning a detection scope within the medical device; acquiring one or more images at a current location of the detection scope; advancing the detection scope within the medical device; identifying one or more defects within the medical device; and updating the procedural data related to the medical device.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein obtaining procedural data includes obtaining one or more of a medical instrument record, a service data record, and a meta data record.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein positioning the detection scope includes positioning the detection scope within a working channel of a medical device.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising determining whether an end of the working channel of the medical device has been reached.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising repeating the steps of acquiring the plurality of images, advancing the detection scope, identifying defects, and determining whether the end of the working channel of the medical device has been reached.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein updating the procedural data is performed after the end of the working channel of the medical device has been reached.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein updating the procedural data includes one or more of updating a medical instrument record, updating a service record, and updating a meta data record.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying one or more defects includes determining a location for each of the one or more defects.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein determining the location for each of the one or more defects includes performing an optical flow analysis.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein determining the location for each of the one or more defects includes measuring an acceleration of the distal tip of the detection scope.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein determining the location for each of the one or more defects includes measuring the ratio between the rotational movement of the motor and the linear movement of the detection scope.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising removing the medical device from service.
13. A device, comprising: an imaging device configured to acquire image data; a processor coupled to the imaging device, the processor configured to analyze image data received from the imaging device; and a data source coupled to the processor, the data source adapted to store image data acquired by the imaging device.
14. The device of claim 1, further comprising an input device coupled to the imaging device and the processor, the input device communicating image data between the imaging device and the processor, the input device adapted to control the characteristics of the imaging device.
15. The device of claim 1, wherein the data source includes a meta data record, a medical instrument record, and a service data record.
16. The device of claim 1, wherein the input device is configured to couple to the imaging device wirelessly.
17. The device of claim 7, wherein the input device is configured to couple to the processor wirelessly.
18. The device of claim 2, wherein the input device further includes a processing unit adapted to process image data.
