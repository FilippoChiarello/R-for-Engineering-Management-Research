HEMODYNAMIC PARAMETER ESTIMATION BASED ON IMAGE DATA
</title>

<abstract>
The present approach relates to determining a reference value based on image data that includes a non-occluded vascular region (such as the ascending aorta in a cardiovascular context). This reference value is compared on a pixel-by pixel basis with the CT values observed in the other vasculature regions. With this in mind, and in a cardiovascular context, the determined FFR value for each pixel is the ratio of CT value in the vascular region of interest to the reference CT value.

<claims>
1. A method for estimating hemodynamic parameters, comprising the steps of: acquiring vasculature image data using an imaging system; segmenting the vasculature image data into a reference vessel region and into a vessel region of interest; determining a reference value based on the reference vessel region; determining for each pixel of the vessel region of interest a fractional flow reserve (FFR) pixel value based at least in part on a ratio of the original pixel value to the reference value; and generating and displaying a FFR image based at least in part on the FFR pixel values determined for the respective pixels of the vessel region of interest.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the vasculature image data comprises cardiac image data.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the imaging system comprises a computed tomography (CT) imaging system or a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging system.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein segmenting the vasculature image data comprises: providing the vascular image data as an input to a neural network trained to perform a binary segmentation of the vasculature image data with respect to the reference vessel region and the vessel region of interest.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the reference vessel region comprises an aortic region and the vessel region of interest comprises a coronary artery region.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the coronary artery region is further segmented into a left anterior descending artery, a right coronary artery, and a left circumflex artery.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of: processing the reference vessel region and the vessel region of interest by: selecting one or more seed points; performing a region growing technique using the one or more seed points to eliminate or re-characterize mis-labeled pixels within the reference vessel region and the vessel region of interest.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the reference value is determined for the reference vessel region by: performing a morphological erosion on the reference vessel region; performing a convolution on the reference vessel region to obtain a set of one-dimensional vectors; averaging the one-dimensional vectors to generate the reference value.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the FFR pixel value for each pixel of the vessel region of interest is a ratio of coronary contrast media uptake to the reference value at each respective pixel.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of: based on the FFR image, measuring an extent of vascular stenosis in a vessel or vessel region based on one of area or diameter.
11. A processor-based system, comprising: a processing component; and a storage or memory encoding one or more processor-executable routines, wherein the routines, when executed by the processing component, cause acts to be performed by the processor-based system comprising: accessing or acquiring vasculature image data; segmenting the vasculature image data into a reference vessel region and into a vessel region of interest; determining a reference value based on the reference vessel region; determining for each pixel of the vessel region of interest a fractional flow reserve (FFR) pixel value based at least in part on a ratio of the original pixel value to the reference value; and generating and displaying a FFR image based at least in part on the FFR pixel values determined for the respective pixels of the vessel region of interest.

17. The processor-based system of claim 11, wherein the routines, when executed by the processing component, cause further acts to be performed by the processor-based system comprising: processing the reference vessel region and the vessel region of interest by: selecting one or more seed points; performing a region growing technique using the one or more seed points to eliminate or re-characterize mis-labeled pixels within the reference vessel region and the vessel region of interest.
18. The processor-based system of claim 11, wherein the reference value is determined for the reference vessel region by: performing a morphological erosion on the reference vessel region; performing a convolution on the reference vessel region to obtain a set of one-dimensional vectors; averaging the one-dimensional vectors to generate the reference value.
