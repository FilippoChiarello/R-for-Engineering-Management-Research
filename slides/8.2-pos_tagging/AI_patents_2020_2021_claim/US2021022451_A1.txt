MOTORIZED TENSIONING SYSTEM WITH SENSORS
</title>

<abstract>
A tensioning system for articles of footwear and articles of apparel is disclosed. The tensioning system includes a tensioning member that is tightened or loosened using a motorized tensioning device for winding and unwinding the tensioning member on a spool. The tensioning system may be used with various sensors to determine how the motorized tensioning device should be controlled.

1. (canceled)
2. An article of footwear, comprising: an upper portion including a lace to adjust fit of the upper portion against a foot, the lace adjustable between a plurality of preset positions based at least in part on manipulation of an effective length of the lace; a lower portion including a mid-sole and an out-sole; a power source, positioned in the lower portion; a motorized tensioning system, coupled to the power source, including: a lace spool to engage a loop of the lace to enable manipulation of the effective length of the lace through rotation of the lace spool; a motor operatively coupled to the spool, wherein the motor is configured to rotate the spool; and an electronic control unit, operatively coupled to the motorized tensioning system, configured to cause the motorized tensioning system to transition between and among the plurality of preset positions, the plurality of preset positions including a preset tightened state, a preset loosened state, and a plurality of transitory states.
3. The article of footwear of claim 2, wherein the electronic control unit is configured to switch among the plurality of preset positions based on interaction with a control device.
4. The article of footwear of claim 3, further comprising the control device.
5. The article of footwear of claim 4, wherein the control device is configured to generate an output based on a touch of the control device by a user.
6. The article of footwear of claim 5, wherein the electronic control unit is further configured to transition among the plurality of transitory states to incrementally increase or decrease the effective length of the lace.
7. The article of footwear of claim 6, wherein a decrease of the effective length of the lace corresponds to a tightening of the lace and an increase of the effective length of the lace corresponds to a loosening of the lace.
8. The article of footwear of claim 7, wherein the preset tightened state corresponds to a state including a shortest effective lace length and the preset loosened state corresponds to a state including a longest effective lace length.
9. A system, comprising: an upper footwear portion including a lace to adjust fit of the upper footwear portion against a foot, the lace adjustable between a plurality of preset positions based at least in part on manipulation of an effective length of the lace; a lower footwear portion including a mid-sole and an out-sole; a power source, positioned in the lower footwear portion; a motorized tensioning system, coupled to the power source, including: a lace spool to engage a loop of the lace to enable manipulation of the effective length of the lace through rotation of the lace spool; a motor operatively coupled to the spool, wherein the motor is configured to rotate the spool; and an electronic control unit, operatively coupled to the motorized tensioning system, configured to cause the motorized tensioning system to transition between and among the plurality of preset positions, the plurality of preset positions including a preset tightened state, a preset loosened state, and a plurality of transitory states.
10. The system of claim 9, further comprising a control device, wherein the electronic control unit is configured to switch among the plurality of preset positions based on interaction with the control device.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the control device is configured to generate an output based on a touch of the control device by a user.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the electronic control unit is further configured to transition among the plurality of transitory states to incrementally increase or decrease the effective length of the lace.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein a decrease of the effective length of the lace corresponds to a tightening of the lace and an increase of the effective length of the lace corresponds to a loosening of the lace.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein preset tightened state corresponds to a fully tightened state and the preset loosened state corresponds to a fully loosened state.
15. A method, comprising: forming an upper footwear portion including a lace to adjust fit of the upper footwear portion against a foot, the lace adjustable between a plurality of preset positions based at least in part on manipulation of an effective length of the lace; coupling a lower footwear portion including a mid-sole and an out-sole to the upper footwear portion; positioning a power source in the lower footwear portion; coupling a motorized tensioning system to the power source, the motorized tensioning system including: a lace spool to engage a loop of the lace to enable manipulation of the effective length of the lace through rotation of the lace spool; a motor operatively coupled to the spool, wherein the motor is configured to rotate the spool; and operatively coupling an electronic control unit to the motorized tensioning system, the electronic control unit configured to cause the motorized tensioning system to transition between and among the plurality of preset positions, the plurality of preset positions including a preset tightened state, a preset loosened state, and a plurality of transitory states.
16. The method of claim 15, further comprising configuring the electronic control unit to switch among the plurality of preset positions based on interaction with a control device.
17. The method of claim 16, further comprising operatively coupling the control device to the electronic control unit.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the control device is configured to generate an output based on a touch of the control device by a user.
19. The method of claim 18, further comprising configuring the electronic control unit is further configured to transition among the plurality of transitory states to incrementally increase or decrease the apparent length of the lace.
20. The method of claim 19, further comprising configurating the electronic control unit to a decrease of the apparent length of the lace to tighten the lace and increase the apparent length of the lace to loosen the lace.
21. The method of claim 20, wherein preset tightened state corresponds to a fully tightened state and the preset loosened state corresponds to a fully loosened state.
