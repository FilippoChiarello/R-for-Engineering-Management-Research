Metadata-Based Cloud Security
</title>

<abstract>
The technology disclosed relates to enforcing multi-part policies on data-deficient transactions of independent data stores. In particular, it relates to combining active analysis of access requests for the independent object stores with inspection of objects in the independent object stores, each of the analysis and inspection generating and persisting object metadata in a supplemental data store, actively processing data-deficient transactions that apply to the objects by accessing the supplemental data store to retrieve object metadata not available in transaction streams of the data-deficient transactions, and actively enforcing the multi-part policies using the retrieved object metadata.
