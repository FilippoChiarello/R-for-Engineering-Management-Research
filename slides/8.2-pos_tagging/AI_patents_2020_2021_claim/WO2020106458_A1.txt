LOCATING SPATIALIZED SOUNDS NODES FOR ECHOLOCATION USING UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
Described herein is a system for generating echolocation sounds to assist a user having no sight or limited sight to navigate a three-dimensional space (e.g., physical environment, computer gaming experience, and/or virtual reality experience). Input is received from a user to generate echolocation sounds to navigate a three-dimensional space. Based at least on the received input, a digital representation of the threedimensional space is segmented into one or more depth planes using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. For each depth plane, object segments are determined for each object within the particular depth plane. Locations of a plurality of echo sound nodes are determined in accordance with the depth level and surface area of each object defined by the determined segments. The echolocation sounds comprising a spatialized sound from each echo sound node originating from the determined location are generated.
