<claims>
1. A cognitive information processing system comprising: a processor; a data bus coupled to the processor; and a non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium embodying computer program code, the non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium being coupled to the data bus, the computer program code interacting with a plurality of computer operations and comprising instructions executable by the processor and configured for: receiving data from a plurality of data sources, the plurality of data sources comprising a blockchain data source, the blockchain data source providing blockchain data; processing the blockchain data to generate a plurality of knowledge elements, the processing being performed via a cognitive inference and learning system, the cognitive inference and learning system executing on a hardware processor of an information processing system and interacting with the plurality of data sources, the cognitive inference and learning system comprising a cognitive platform, the cognitive platform comprising a cognitive graph, the cognitive graph being derived from the plurality of data sources, the cognitive graph comprising an application cognitive graph, the application cognitive graph comprising a cognitive graph associated with a cognitive application, interactions between the cognitive application and the application cognitive graph being represented as a set of nodes in the cognitive graph, and, a cognitive engine, the cognitive engine comprising a dataset engine, a graph query engine and an insight/learning engine; performing a cognitive operation via the cognitive inference and learning system using the blockchain data, the cognitive learning operation implementing a cognitive learning technique according to a cognitive learning framework, the cognitive learning framework comprising a plurality of cognitive learning styles and a plurality of cognitive learning categories, each of the plurality of cognitive learning styles comprising a generalized learning approach implemented by the cognitive inference and learning system to perform the cognitive learning operation, each of the plurality of cognitive learning categories referring to a source of information used by the cognitive inference and learning system when performing the cognitive learning operation, an individual cognitive learning technique being associated with a primary cognitive learning style and bounded by an associated primary cognitive learning category, the cognitive learning operation applying the cognitive learning technique via a machine learning algorithm to generate a cognitive learning result; processing the blockchain data to generate cognitive blockchain data; updating a knowledge model using the cognitive learning result, the updating being performed via the cognitive platform of the cognitive inference and learning system; storing the plurality of knowledge elements and the cognitive blockchain data within the cognitive graph; and, processing the plurality of knowledge elements to generate a cognitive insight associated with a compliance requirement.
2. The cognitive information processing system of claim 1, wherein: the compliance requirement is related to at least one of a governance compliance requirement, a regulatory compliance requirement and an anti-fraud compliance requirement.
3. The cognitive information processing system of claim 2, wherein the instructions are further configured for: generating a cognitive session graph, the cognitive session graph being associated with a session, the cognitive session graph comprising at least some enriched data; and, associating a cognitive blockchain with the cognitive session graph.
4. The cognitive information processing system of claim 3, wherein the instructions are further configured for: using the block chain data to establish an identity of an entity; and, validating legitimacy of a blockchain transaction based upon the identity of the entity.
