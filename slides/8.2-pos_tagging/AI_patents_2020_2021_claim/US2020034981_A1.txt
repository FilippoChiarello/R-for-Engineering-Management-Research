FACE DIRECTION ESTIMATION DEVICE AND FACE DIRECTION ESTIMATION METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A face direction estimation device (10) includes a face image acquiring unit (11) acquiring a shot face image, a face detecting unit (12) detecting the face position in the face image, a face organ detecting unit (13) detecting face organs in the detected face position, a switching determining unit (14) evaluating the detected face organs, and switching between first and second face direction estimating methods in accordance with the evaluation, a first face direction estimating unit (15) estimating the face direction in accordance with a positional relationship among the detected face organs when the switching determining unit switches to the first face direction estimating method, and a second face direction estimating unit (16) calculating a face movement amount on the basis of the detected face position and estimating the face direction in accordance with the movement amount when the switching determining unit switches to the second face direction estimating method.
