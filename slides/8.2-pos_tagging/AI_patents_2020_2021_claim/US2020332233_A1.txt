SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR SPOTTING TREATMENT, INSPECTION, AND TRACKING OF ARTICLES
</title>

<abstract>
A method of treatment of one or more articles may comprise locating a stain on an article based on a tag on the article; placing the stain on a nose of a spotting board; positioning a steam gun at least two or more inches away from the stain; simultaneously activating a steam supply and a vacuum supply of the spotting board; moving the steam gun in a defined motion relative to the stain for at least 30 seconds; simultaneously activating the vacuum supply and an air supply of the spotting board; moving the steam gun in the defined motion relative to the stain until the article is at least partially dry; and inspecting the stain.

1. 1-17. (canceled)
18. A method of treatment of one or more articles, comprising: locating a stain on an article based on a tag comprising a spotting treatment tracker for the article and a treatment name or identifier associated with treatment of the article; placing a portion of the article comprising the stain on a spotting board having a corrosion-resistant layer; treating the article with one or both of a wet-side pre-spotting agent and a dry-side pre-spotting agent; treating the portion of the article comprising the stain with one or both of a steam supply and a vacuum supply of the spotting board; treating the portion of the article comprising the stain with one or both of the vacuum supply and an air supply of the spotting board until the article is at least partially dry; inspecting the stain on an inspection surface to determine a status of the stain; treating the article with a spotting agent treatment based on the determined status of the stain; re-inspecting the stain on the inspection surface; and updating the tag of the article and/or a data record of the article in one or more servers based on one or more results of the re-inspection.
19. The method of claim 18, comprising treating the portion of the article comprising the stain with a steam supply and a vacuum supply of the spotting board by: positioning a steam gun at least two or more inches away from the portion of the article comprising the stain; and moving the steam gun in a defined motion relative to the portion of the article comprising the stain.
20. The method of claim 18, comprising treating the portion of the article comprising the stain with one or both of the vacuum supply and the air supply of the spotting board by moving one or more of the steam gun, the vacuum supply, and the air supply in a defined motion relative to the stain until the article is at least partially dry.
21. The method of claim 18, further including laying the article flat on drying racks to dry for at least 30 minutes.
22. The method of claim 18, wherein the treatment name or identifier is a name or identifier of a technician or supervisor associated with treatment of the article.
23. The method of claim 20, wherein the moving the one or more of the steam gun, the vacuum supply, and the air supply comprises moving the one or more of the steam gun, the vacuum supply, and the air supply in the defined motion relative to the stain until the article is fully dry.
24. The method of claim 18, further including categorizing the stain into one of one or more categories.
25. The method of claim 24, wherein the one or more categories include oil stain, dye stain, or tannin stain.
26. The method of claim 25, where the tannin stain is invisible before being subjected to heat.
27. The method of claim 18, wherein the method is performed by a robot.
28. The method of claim 18, wherein inspecting the stain comprises inspecting the stain with one or more sensors, wherein the one or more sensors comprise light sensors, chemical sensors, humidity sensors, color sensors, or odor sensors.
29. The method of claim 18, wherein the tag comprises a barcode.
30. The method of claim 20, wherein the defined motion is a circular, a rectangular, a triangular, or a linear motion.
31. A system for treating of one or more articles, comprising: a tag comprising a spotting treatment tracker for the one or more articles and a treatment name or identifier associated with treatment of the article; an imaging device configured to scan the tag and locate a stain on the article based on the tag; a spotting board having a corrosion-resistant layer configured to receive a portion of the article comprising the stain, wherein the spotting board is configured to enable a human or robot to perform one or more operations, the one or more operations comprising: treating the article with one or both of a wet-side pre-spotting agent and a dry-side pre-spotting agent; treating the article by activating one or both of a steam supply and a vacuum supply of the spotting board; treating the article by activating one or both of the vacuum supply and an air supply of the spotting board until the article is at least partially dry; inspecting the stain on an inspection surface to determine a status of the stain; treating the article with a spotting agent treatment based on the determined status of the stain; and re-inspecting the stain on the inspection surface; and one or more servers including one or more databases and one or more processors programmed with instructions to update the tag of the article and/or a data record of the article stored in the one or more databases based on one or more results of the re-inspection.
32. The system of claim 31, wherein the tag comprises a barcode.
33. The system of claim 31, wherein the treatment name or identifier is a name or identifier of a technician or supervisor associated with treatment of the article.
34. The system of claim 31, wherein the tag further comprises a type of the stain, a type of a spotting agent, or whether the stain is removed.
35. The system of claim 31, wherein the article is made of cashmere.
