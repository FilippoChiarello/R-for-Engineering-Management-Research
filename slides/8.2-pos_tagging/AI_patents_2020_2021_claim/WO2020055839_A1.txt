<title>
NEURAL NETWORK INFERENCING ON PROTECTED DATA
</title>

<abstract>
A method and apparatus for inferencing on protected data. A user device retrieves protected data from a secure memory, generates inferences about the protected data using one or more neural network models stored on the user device, and updates a user interface of the user device based at least in part on the inferences. The secure memory is inaccessible to applications executing in a rich environment of the user device. Thus, in some aspects, the inferences may be generated, at least in part, by a neural network application executing in a trusted environment of the user device.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1 . A method of inferencing by a user device, comprising:
retrieving protected data from a secure memory, wherein the secure memory is inaccessible to applications executing in a rich environment of the user device;
generating inferences about the protected data using one or more neural network models stored on the user device; and
updating a user interface of the user device based at least in part on the inferences.
2. The method of claim 1 , wherein the one or more neural network models are stored in the secure memory.
3. The method of claim 1 , wherein the inferences are generated, at least in part, by a neural network application executing in a trusted environment of the user device.
4. The method of claim 1 , wherein the inferences are generated, at least in part, by a neural network processing unit (NPU).
5. The method of claim 1 , wherein the protected data includes pixel data for premium media content to be displayed or played back via the user interface.
6. The method of claim 1 , wherein the protected data includes user input data or personal information about a user of the device.
7. The method of claim 1 , wherein the updating comprises:
outputting content or recommendations via the user interface based at least in part on the inferences.
8. The method of claim 1 , further comprising:
transmitting filtered feedback data to an external network based at least in part on the inferences, wherein the filtered feedback data does not include any of the protected data stored in the secure memory.
9. The method of claim 1 , further comprising:
updating the one or more neural network models based at least in part on the inferences.
10. The method of claim 7, further comprising:
sending the updated neural network models to an external network resource configured for training neural network models.
1 1 . A user device comprising:
a user interface;
processing circuitry; and
a secure memory storing instructions that, when executed by the processing circuitry, causes the user device to:
retrieve protected data from the secure memory, wherein the secure memory is inaccessible to applications executing in a rich environment of the user device;
generate inferences about the protected data using one or more neural network models stored on the user device; and
update the user interface based at least in part on the inferences.
12. The user device of claim 1 1 , wherein the one or more neural network models are stored in the secure memory.
13. The user device of claim 1 1 , wherein the instructions are executed in a trusted environment of the user device.
14. The user device of claim 1 1 , wherein the processing circuitry includes a neural network processing unit (NPU).
15. The user device of claim 1 1 , wherein the protected data includes pixel data for premium media content to be displayed or played back via the user interface.
16. The user device of claim 1 1 , wherein the protected data includes user input data or personal information about a user of the device.
17. The user device of claim 1 1 , wherein execution of the instructions for updating the user interface causes the user device to:
output content or recommendations via the user interface based at least in part on the inferences.
18. The user device of claim 1 1 , wherein execution of the instructions further causes the user device to:
update the one or more neural network models based at least in part on the inferences.
19. A user device comprising:
processing circuitry configured to operate in a secure state or a nonsecure state; and
a memory having a secure partition and a non-secure partition, the secure partition storing instructions that, when executed by the processing circuitry while operating in the secure state, causes the user device to:
retrieve protected data from the secure partition, wherein the secure partition is inaccessible to the processing circuitry when operating in the non-secure state;
retrieve one or more neural network models from the secure partition; and
generate inferences about the protected data using the one or more neural network models.
20. The user device of claim 19, wherein the protected data includes pixel data for premium media content to be displayed or played back via the user interface.
21 . The user device of claim 19, wherein the protected data includes user input data or personal information about a user of the device.
22. The user device of claim 19, wherein execution of the instructions further causes the user device to:
output content or recommendations based at least in part on the inferences.
23. The user device of claim 19, wherein the non-secure partition stores instructions that, when executed by the processing circuitry, further causes the user device to:
transmit filtered feedback data to an external network based at least in part on the inferences, wherein the filtered feedback data does not include any of the protected data stored in the secure memory.
24. The user device of claim 19, wherein execution of the instructions further causes the user device to:
update the one or more neural network models based at least in part on the inferences.
25. The user device of claim 24, wherein the non-secure partition stores instructions that, when executed by the processing circuitry, further causes the user device to:
transmit the updated neural network models to an external network resource configured for training neural network models.
