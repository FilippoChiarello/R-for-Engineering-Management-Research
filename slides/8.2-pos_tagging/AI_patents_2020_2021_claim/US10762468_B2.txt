<title>
Adaptive process for guiding human-performed inventory tasks
</title>

<abstract>
An inventory management system is described. The inventory management system may be configured to determine a head or eye level of an operator interacting with a storage structure. As part of this process, visual image data, thermal image data, or LiDAR data can be obtained and the eyes or head of the operator identified in the obtained data, or the operator may wear a device usable to determine head or eye position. The determined head or eye level can be correlated with a vertical position on a display, and inventory information can be displayed to the operator at the determined level.

<claims>
1. A method for dynamically positioning display information, the method comprising, via one or more computer processors in data communication with a display: receiving image data representing one or more interactions between an operator and one or both of the display and a storage structure of an inventory system, the storage structure having multiple levels, the display positioned to display information that is visible to the operator while the operator interacts with the storage structure, the display having a height that spans the multiple levels of the storage structure, wherein the image data includes an image of the head of the operator; analyzing the image data to identify at least a head level of the operator during the one or more interactions; correlating the identified head level with a position on the display such that a vertical displacement between a floor and the position on the display is approximately equal to a vertical displacement between the floor and the head level of the operator; receiving contextual information representing an item of the inventory system in the storage structure, the contextual information usable by the operator to identify the item among a plurality of physical items in the storage structure; and causing display of the contextual information to the operator at the position on the display.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: tracking a plurality of interactions between the operator and a plurality of storage structures of the inventory system; predicting, based on the tracked plurality of interactions, a location on the display where the operator looks first in at least one inventory assignment situation; and selecting an initial position on the display at which to display information based at least partly on the location where the operator looks first.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the image data comprises LiDAR data.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein analyzing the image data comprises identifying the head of the operator in the image data.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: detecting, based on the image data, a change in the head level of the operator to a new head level during the one or more interactions; and updating a display position of the contextual information on the display to correspond to the new head level.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the head level is an eye level of the operator.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the display is mounted at a fixed location in a work area.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the storage structure is coupled to a mobile drive unit that moves the storage structure, and the method comprises causing the mobile drive unit to move the storage structure to a position adjacent to the fixed location of the display.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining a bin of the storage structure that contains the item; and causing a projector to illuminate the bin.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the height of the display is in the range of five to ten feet.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the height of the display is in the range of seven to nine feet.
12. A system comprising: a display that is positioned to display information that is visible to an operator while the operator interacts with a storage structure that holds physical inventory items, the storage structure having multiple levels, the display having a height that spans the multiple levels; and a computing system comprising one or more processors, the computing system programmed to implement a process that comprises: receiving image data showing at least a head of the operator as the operator interacts with one or both of the display and the storage structure; determining at least a head level of the operator by analyzing the image data; receiving contextual information representing an item of inventory stored in the storage structure, the contextual information usable by the operator to identify the item among a plurality of physical items in the storage structure; determining a display position on the display corresponding to the determined head level such that a vertical displacement between a floor and the display position is approximately equal to a vertical displacement between the floor and the head level of the operator; and causing the contextual information to be displayed on the display at said display position.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the image data comprises LiDAR data.
14. The system of claim 12, wherein the computing system is programmed to detect the head of the operator in the image data.
15. The system of claim 12, wherein the computing system is additionally programmed to: detect, based on the image data, a change in the head level of the operator to a new head level; and update a display position of the contextual information on the display to correspond to the new head level.
16. The system of claim 12, wherein the head level is an eye level of the operator.
17. The system of claim 12, wherein the display is mounted at a fixed location in a work area.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the storage structure is coupled to a mobile drive unit that moves the storage structure, and the computing system is programmed to cause the mobile drive unit to move the storage structure to a position adjacent to the fixed location of the display.
19. The system of claim 12, wherein the computing system is additionally programmed to: determine a bin of the storage structure that contains the item; and cause a projector to illuminate the bin.
20. The system of claim 12, wherein the height of the display is in the range of five to ten feet.
21. The system of claim 12, wherein the height of the display is in the range of seven to nine feet.
22. The system of claim 12, wherein the display is a touch-sensitive display.
