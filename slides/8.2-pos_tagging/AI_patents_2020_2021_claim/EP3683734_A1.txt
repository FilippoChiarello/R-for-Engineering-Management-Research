LEARNING METHOD, LEARNING PROGRAM, AND LEARNING APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
A learning apparatus (100) is configured to augment original training data based on non-stored target information included in the original training data to generate a plurality of augmented training data. The learning apparatus (100) is configured to generate a plurality of intermediate feature values by inputting the plurality of augmented training data to a learning model. The learning apparatus (100) is configured to learn a parameter of the learning model such that, with regard to the plurality of intermediate feature values, each of the plurality of intermediate feature values generated from a plurality of augmented training data, augmented from reference training data, becomes similar to a reference feature value.

<claims>
1. A learning method comprising: augmenting original training data based on non-stored target information included in the original training data to generate a plurality of augmented training data; generating a plurality of intermediate feature values by inputting the plurality of augmented training data to a learning model; and learning a parameter of the learning model such that, with regard to the plurality of intermediate feature values, each of the plurality of intermediate feature values generated from a plurality of augmented training data, augmented from reference training data, becomes similar to a reference feature value.
2. The learning method according to claim 1, wherein the generating the augmented training data includes generating dummy information based on the non-stored target information and adding the generated dummy information to the original training data to generate the augmented training data.
3. The learning method according to claim 2, wherein
the non-stored target information is information with which an individual person is identifiable, and
the generating the augmented training data includes generating, as the dummy information, information similar to the information with which the individual person is identifiable.
4. The learning method according to claim 1, 2, or 3, further including storing a learned reference feature value and correct information corresponding to original training data in a related manner.
5. A learning program that causes a computer (300) to execute a process comprising: augmenting original training data based on non-stored target information included in the original training data to generate a plurality of augmented training data; generating a plurality of intermediate feature values by inputting the plurality of augmented training data to a learning model; and learning a parameter of the learning model such that, with regard to the plurality of intermediate feature values, each of the plurality of intermediate feature values generated from a plurality of augmented training data, augmented from reference training data, becomes similar to a reference feature value.
6. The learning program according to claim 5, wherein the generating the augmented training data generates dummy information based on the non-stored target information and adds the generated dummy information to the original training data to generate the augmented training data.
7. The learning program according to claim 6, wherein
the non-stored target information is information with which an individual person is identifiable, and
the generating the augmented training data generates, as the dummy information, information similar to the information with which the individual person is identifiable.
8. The learning program according to claim 5, 6, or 7, further including storing a learned reference feature value and correct information corresponding to original training data in a related manner.
9. A learning apparatus (100) comprising: an augmentation unit (150b) configured to augment original training data based on non-stored target information included in the original training data to generate a plurality of augmented training data; a feature value generation unit (150c) configured to generate a plurality of intermediate feature values by inputting the plurality of augmented training data to a learning model; and a learning unit (150d) configured to learn a parameter of the learning model such that, with regard to the plurality of intermediate feature values, each of the plurality of intermediate feature values generated from a plurality of augmented training data, augmented from reference training data, becomes similar to a reference feature value.
10. The learning apparatus (100) according to claim 9, wherein the augmentation unit (150b) is configured to generate dummy information based on the non-stored target information and add the generated dummy information to the original training data to generate the augmented training data.
11. The learning apparatus (100) according to claim 10, wherein
the non-stored target information is information with which an individual person is identifiable, and
the augmentation unit (150b) is configured to generate, as the dummy information, information similar to the information with which the individual person is identifiable.
12. The learning apparatus (100) according to claim 9, 10, or 11, wherein the learning unit (150d) is configured to store a learned reference feature value and correct information corresponding to original training data in a related manner.
