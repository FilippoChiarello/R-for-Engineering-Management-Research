Message sender security in messaging system
</title>

<abstract>
Some embodiments include a method of providing security and privacy for a message sender. The method can include a messaging application determining that a messaging interface of the computing device is active and is revealing or about to reveal the electronic message. The messaging application can identify a recipient account of a messaging server system that is associated with the electronic message according to the electronic message or the messaging server system. The messaging application can then monitor a data feed from a sensor of the computing device to detect a biometric pattern that matches against a biometric profile model associated with the recipient account utilizing a biometric recognition process. In response to determining that the detected biometric pattern does not match the biometric profile model associated with the recipient account, the messaging application can activate a privacy shield to prevent content of the electronic message from being revealed.
