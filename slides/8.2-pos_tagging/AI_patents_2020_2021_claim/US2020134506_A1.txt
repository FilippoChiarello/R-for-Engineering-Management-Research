MODEL TRAINING METHOD, DATA IDENTIFICATION METHOD AND DATA IDENTIFICATION DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A method of training a student model corresponding to a teacher model is provided. The teacher model is obtained through training by taking first input data as input data and taking a corresponding output data as an output target. The method comprises training the student model by taking second input data as input data and taking the corresponding output data as an output target. The second input data is data obtained due to changing of the first input data.

<claims>
1. A method of training a student model corresponding to a teacher model, the method comprising: training the student model corresponding to the teacher model where the teacher model is obtained through training by taking first input data as input data and taking a corresponding output data as an output target, the training of the student model being implemented by taking second input data as input data and taking the corresponding output data as an output target, and wherein the second input data is data obtained due to changing of the first input data.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the training of the student model comprises: training the student model by iteratively decreasing a difference between an output of the teacher model and an output of the student model.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein a difference function for calculating the difference is determined based on a data correlation between the first input data and the second input data.
4. The method according to claim 3, wherein the difference function is MK-MMD.
5. The method according to claim 3, wherein a Logit loss function and a characteristic loss function are calculated by using the difference function in the training of the student model.
6. The method according to claim 4, wherein a Logit loss function and a characteristic loss function are calculated by using the difference function in the training of the student model.
7. The method according to claim 3, wherein a Softmax loss function is calculated in the training of the student model.
8. The method according to claim 4, wherein a Softmax loss function is calculated in the training of the student model.
9. The method according to claim 1, wherein the first input data comprises one of image data, voice data or text data.
10. The method according to claim 2, wherein the first input data comprises one of image data, voice data or text data.
11. The method according to claim 3, wherein the first input data comprises one of image data, voice data or text data.
12. The method according to claim 4, wherein the first input data comprises one of image data, voice data or text data.
13. The method according to claim 5, wherein the changing is based on a signal processing corresponding to a type of the first input data.
14. The method according to claim 1, wherein the teacher model is obtained through training by taking the first input data prior to the changing.
15. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: developing a new student model through the training of student model without requiring re-training of the teacher model.
16. A data identification method, comprising: performing data identification by using the student model obtained through training by using the method according to claim 1.
17. A data identification device, comprising: at least one processor configured to implement the method according to claim 16.
