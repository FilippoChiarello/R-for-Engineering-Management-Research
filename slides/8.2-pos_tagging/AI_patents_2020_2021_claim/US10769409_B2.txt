Culture detection and measurement over time

<abstract>
A computer method for correlating depictions of colonies of microorganisms includes receiving an image of a substrate associated with a first time and showing a colony of microorganisms. A second image of the same substrate and associated with a second time shows a candidate colony of microorganisms. A region of the second image that shows the candidate colony of microorganisms is located. The first region of the first image is compared to the second region of the second image. Based on the comparison of the images, the candidate colony of microorganism is determined to be the same colony as the first colony of microorganisms. Systems for moving substrates having colonies of microorganisms and maintaining orientation of the substrates before and after movement are also described.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for correlating depictions of colonies of microorganisms, the method comprising: receiving a first image of a substrate having disposed on a surface thereof a colony of microorganisms, the first image associated with a first time and depicting the colony of microorganisms; locating, using a processor, a first region in the first image, the first region depicting the colony of microorganisms; receiving a second image of the substrate having disposed on the surface thereof a candidate colony of microorganisms, the second image associated with a second time different from the first time and depicting the candidate colony of microorganisms; locating, using the processor, a second region in the second image, the second region depicting the candidate colony of microorganisms; comparing, using the processor, the first region in the first image and the second region in the second image to provide a comparison result; and determining, based at least in part on the comparison result, that the candidate colony of microorganisms is a same colony as the colony of microorganisms, wherein the comparing is based at least in part on mathematically minimizing an objective function comparing first coordinates of the first region, second coordinates of the second region, third coordinates of a third region in the first image, the third region depicting a second colony of microorganisms, and fourth coordinates of a fourth region in the second image, the fourth region depicting a second candidate colony of microorganisms.
2. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the first image and the second image are both images of substantially an entirety of the surface of the substrate.
3. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the comparing is based at least in part on least-squares mathematical minimization comparing the first coordinates of the first region with the second coordinates of the second region.
4. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, further comprising receiving a first magnified light image of the first region and a second magnified light image of the second region.
5. The computer-implemented method according to claim 4, further comprising creating a visual representation of the colony of microorganisms changing over time by aligning the first magnified light image of the first region with the second magnified light image of the second region in an order based at least in part on the first time associated with the first image and the second time associated with the second image.
6. The computer-implemented method according to claim 4, further comprising determining, using the processor, a growth rate of the colony of microorganisms based on a change in size between the colony of microorganisms in the first magnified light image and the colony of microorganisms in the second magnified light image.
7. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, further comprising: operating, using the processor, a coherent light source to generate a first scatter pattern of the colony of microorganisms associated with the first time; operating, using the processor, the coherent light source to generate a second scatter pattern the candidate colony of microorganisms associated with the second time; and creating a visual representation of the colony of microorganisms changing over time by aligning a first scatter image of the first scatter pattern with a second scatter image of the second scatter pattern in an order based in at least part on the first time associated with the first scatter pattern and the second time associated with the second scatter pattern.
