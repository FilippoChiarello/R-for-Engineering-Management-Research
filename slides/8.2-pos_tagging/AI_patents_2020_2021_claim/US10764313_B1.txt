Method and system for protection against network-based cyber threats
</title>

<abstract>
An Active Cyber Defense method and system is provided for detecting and stopping malicious cyber activity including for example Drive-By Exploits, Malicious Binaries, Data Exfiltration, Social Engineering and Credential Stealing Attacks. The system disclosed herein can be configured to detect and block multi protocol network-based cyber attacks targeting different platforms or operating systems. The system can also be configured to be scalable. The system as disclosed herein can conduct real time inspection of network traffic and can self-learn and adapt as needed to a changing cyber threat landscape.

<claims>
1. A cyber defense system for detecting and blocking malicious cyber activity of a network, the cyber defense system comprising: at least one processor, a memory, and a computer program including instructions executable by the processor to create an application, wherein the application comprises: (a) a first module configured to monitor and capture network session activity between one or more client devices and one or more internet servers and to extract a network flow from the network session activity; (b) a second module configured to evaluate the network flow to identify a type of protocol associated with the network flow; and (c) a third module configured to: i. extract and evaluate a first set of features from the network flow, ii. classify the network flow as a potentially malicious flow or as a benign flow by processing the first set of features using a first set of classifiers, and iii. evaluate only the potentially malicious flow and to determine whether the potentially malicious flow is malicious or benign by: collecting active features in real-time and processing the active features using a second set of classifiers different from the first set of classifiers.
2. The cyber defense system of claim 1, wherein the application further comprises a fourth module configured to: i. identify a malware name in response to the malicious flow and to evaluate the malicious flow to identify a hacker group responsible for an attack associated with the malicious flow; and ii. block subsequent communication associated with the malicious flow.
3. The cyber defense system of claim 2, wherein the fourth module is further configured to store the infected machine and user information, and wherein the stored infected machine and user information are marked as an incident.
4. The cyber defense system of claim 2, wherein the fourth module is further configured to send a notification related to the incident.
5. The cyber defense system of claim 1, wherein the first set of features comprise protocol features.
6. The cyber defense system of claim 5, wherein the first set of features further comprise one or more members selected from the group consisting of: binary features, nominal features, and numeric features.
7. The cyber defense system of claim 1, wherein the potentially malicious flow is classified using automated self-learning classifiers.
8. The cyber defense system of claim 1, wherein the active features comprise at least visual and natural language based features.
9. The cyber defense system of claim 8, wherein the visual and natural language based features comprise at least images.
10. The cyber defense system of claim 8, wherein the active features further comprise features extracted from real-time intelligence collected by probing a suspicious server associated with the potentially malicious flow.
11. The cyber defense system of claim 1, wherein the second set of classifiers are automated self-learning classifiers.
12. The cyber defense system of claim 1, wherein the first set of classifiers are selected based on the type of protocol identified in (b).
13. The cyber defense system of claim 12, wherein each of the first set of classifiers corresponds to a type of protocol.
14. The cyber defense system of claim 9, wherein the at least visual and natural language based features are processed by the second set of classifiers to detect a credential stealing attack.
15. The cyber defense system of claim 14, wherein the second set of classifiers.
16. The cyber defense system of claim 10, wherein the real-time intelligence comprises evasion-based intelligence about a presence of an evasion behavior of the one or more internet servers employing an evasion technique to avoid detection of malicious activities of the one or more internet servers.
17. The cyber defense system of claim 10, wherein the real-time intelligence is collected using anonymous VPN/Proxy servers to establish out-of-band connections with the one or more internet servers.
