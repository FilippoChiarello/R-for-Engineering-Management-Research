<title>
Data extraction and duplicate detection
</title>

<abstract>
A system provides an end-to-end solution for invoice processing which includes reading invoices (both pdfs and images), extracting key relevant information from the face of invoices, organizing the relevant information in a structured template as a key-value pair, and comparing invoices based on the similarities between different invoice fields to identify potential duplicate invoices.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: receiving, by a computer-based system, an invoice; performing, by the computer-based system, optical character recognition on the invoice; extracting, by the computer-based system, a plurality of key-value pairs from the invoice; generating, by the computer-based system, a structured template comprising the plurality of key-value pairs; forming, by the computer-based system, a feature vector; determining, by the computer-based system using a duplicate model and based on the feature vector, that the invoice is a duplicate of a historic invoice in a historic invoice database; receiving, by the computer-based system, an input to the duplicate model indicating an accuracy of the duplicate determination; and modifying, by the computer-based system and based on the input, the duplicate model.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the forming the feature vector comprises concatenating similarity measures across different fields.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising executing, by the computer-based system, a word break algorithm to segment non-space separated words which exist in a reference dictionary.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising dividing, by the computer-based system, a plurality of bigrams in the invoice into categories consisting of (1) both words in a reference dictionary; (2) only first word in the reference dictionary; (3) only second word in the reference dictionary; and (4) neither word in the reference dictionary.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising performing, by the computer-based system, a table parsing operation on the invoice.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising saving, by the computer-based system, a value and location of a field in the invoice.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising creating, by the computer-based system, a lookup dictionary comprising description keywords.
8. A system comprising: a processor; and a tangible, non-transitory memory configured to communicate with the processor, the tangible, non-transitory memory having instructions stored thereon that, in response to execution by the processor, cause the processor to perform operations comprising: receiving, by the processor, an invoice; performing, by the processor, optical character recognition on the invoice; extracting, by the processor, a plurality of key-value pairs from the invoice; generating, by the processor, a structured template comprising the plurality of key-value pairs; forming, by the processor, a feature vector; determining, by the processor using a duplicate model and based on the feature vector, that the invoice is a duplicate of a historic invoice in a historic invoice database; receiving, by the processor, an input to the duplicate model indicating an accuracy of the duplicate determination; and modifying, by the processor and based on the input, the duplicate model.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the forming the feature vector comprises concatenating similarity measures across different fields.
10. The system of claim 8, further comprising executing, by the processor, a word break algorithm to segment non-space separated words which exist in a reference dictionary.
11. The system of claim 8, further comprising dividing, by the processor, a plurality of bigrams in the invoice into categories consisting of (1) both words in a reference dictionary; (2) only first word in the reference dictionary; (3) only second word in the reference dictionary; and (4) neither word in the reference dictionary.
12. The system of claim 8, further comprising performing, by the processor, a table parsing operation on the invoice.
13. The system of claim 8, further comprising saving, by the processor, a value and location of a field in the invoice.
14. The system of claim 8, further comprising creating, by the processor, a lookup dictionary comprising description keywords.
15. An article of manufacture including a non-transitory, tangible computer readable storage medium having instructions stored thereon that, in response to execution by a computer-based system, cause the computer-based system to perform operations comprising: receiving, by the computer-based system, an invoice; performing, by the computer-based system, optical character recognition on the invoice; extracting, by the computer-based system, a plurality of key-value pairs from the invoice; generating, by the computer-based system, a structured template comprising the plurality of key-value pairs; forming, by the computer-based system, a feature vector; determining, by the computer-based system using a duplicate model and based on the feature vector, that the invoice is a duplicate of a historic invoice in a historic invoice database; receiving, by the computer-based system, an input to the duplicate model indicating an accuracy of the duplicate determination; and modifying, by the computer-based system and based on the input, the duplicate model.
16. The article of manufacture of claim 15, wherein the forming the feature vector comprises concatenating similarity measures across different fields.
17. The article of manufacture of claim 15, further comprising executing, by the computer-based system, a word break algorithm to segment non-space separated words which exist in a reference dictionary.
18. The article of manufacture of claim 15, further comprising dividing, by the computer-based system, a plurality of bigrams in the invoice into categories consisting of (1) both words in a reference dictionary; (2) only first word in the reference dictionary; (3) only second word in the reference dictionary; and (4) neither word in the reference dictionary.
19. The article of manufacture of claim 15, further comprising performing a table parsing operation on the invoice.
20. The article of manufacture of claim 15, further comprising saving, by the computer-based system, a value and location of a field in the invoice.
