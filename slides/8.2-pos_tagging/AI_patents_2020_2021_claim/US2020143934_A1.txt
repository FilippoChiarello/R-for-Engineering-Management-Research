SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR SEMI-AUTOMATIC TUMOR SEGMENTATION
</title>

<abstract>
A method for volumetric segmentation in a plurality of planar medical images includes, receiving, at an electronic processor, the plurality of planar medical images. A boundary of a candidate structure in the plurality of medical images is generated using a segmentation model. A first planar medical image from the plurality of planar medical images is displayed on a display. A user input is received using a user interface indicating a region in the first planar medical image. A first planar contour of the candidate structure is generated. The region is compared to the boundary. Responsive to the region being at least partially within the boundary, the first planar medical image is re-displayed on the display showing the first planar contour of the structure, and a finding record for the candidate structure including the boundary is generated.
