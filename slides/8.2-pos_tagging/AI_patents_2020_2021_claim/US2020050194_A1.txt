APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR SWITCHING CONTROL AUTHORITY OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus for switching a control authority of an autonomous vehicle may include: a capturing unit configured to capture an image of the inside of a vehicle and provide the captured image; a storage unit configured to store learning information and weights for inferring the presence and age of a passenger and whether a driver holds a steering wheel, based on deep learning; and a control unit configured to determine whether the passenger can drive the vehicle, by inferring the presence and age of the passenger through the learning information and weights stored in the storage unit from the image inputted from the capturing unit according to a manual mode switch request, infer whether the driver holds the steering wheel, and switch the control authority of the vehicle to a manual mode.

<claims>
1. An apparatus for switching a control authority of an autonomous vehicle, comprising: a capturing unit configured to capture an image of the inside of a vehicle and provide the captured image; a storage unit configured to store learning information and weights for inferring the presence and age of a passenger and whether the passenger holds a steering wheel, based on deep learning; and a control unit configured to determine whether the passenger can drive the vehicle, by inferring a presence and an age of the passenger through the learning information and weights stored in the storage unit from the image inputted from the capturing unit according to a manual ii mode switch request, infer whether the passenger holds the steering wheel, and switch the control authority of the vehicle to a manual mode.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the control unit checks a legal age of the passenger and whether the passenger has a license, when determining whether the passenger can drive the vehicle.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein when the determination result indicates that the passenger cannot drive the vehicle, the control unit stops the vehicle through an autonomous driving unit.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a seat moving unit configured to move a seat of the passenger in the vehicle, wherein when the passenger who can drive the vehicle is not seated in a driver seat after the determining of whether the passenger can drive the vehicle, the control unit operates the seat moving unit to move the seat of the passenger to the driver seat.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising an output unit configured to inform a driver of the switch-over of the control authority by the control unit.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein, when it is determined that the passenger can drive the vehicle, the control unit infers whether the passenger holds the steering wheel.
7. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein, when it is inferred that the passenger does not hold the steering wheel, the control unit stops the vehicle through an autonomous driving unit.
8. A method for switching a control authority of an autonomous vehicle, comprising: receiving, by a control unit, an image from a capturing unit according to a manual mode switch request; inferring, by the control unit, a presence and an age of a passenger from the image through learning information and weights stored in a storage unit; determining, by the control unit, whether the passenger can drive the vehicle, after the inferring of the presence and age of the passenger; inferring, by the control unit, whether a passenger holds a steering wheel, according to the determination result of the determining of whether the passenger can drive the vehicle; and switching, by the control unit, a control authority of the vehicle to a manual mode according to the result of the inferring of whether the passenger holds the steering wheel.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the determining of whether the passenger can drive the vehicle comprises checking a legal age of the passenger and whether the passenger has a license.
10. The method of claim 8, further comprising: determining, by the control unit, whether the passenger who can drive the vehicle is seated in a driver seat, after the determining of whether the passenger can drive the vehicle; and operating, by the control unit, a seat moving unit to move the seat of the passenger to the driver seat, according to a result of the determining of whether the passenger is seated in the driver seat.
11. The method of claim 8, further comprising stopping, by the control unit, the vehicle through an autonomous driving unit, when a result of the determining of whether the passenger can drive the vehicle indicates that the passenger cannot drive the vehicle.
12. The method of claim 8, further comprising informing, by the control unit, a driver that the control authority was switched to the manual mode, through an output unit.
13. The method of claim 8, wherein, in the determining of whether the passenger can drive the vehicle, when it is determined that the passenger can drive the vehicle, the control unit performs the step of the inferring whether the passenger holds the steering wheel.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein, in the inferring whether the passenger holds the steering wheel, when it is inferred that the passenger does not hold the steering wheel, the control unit stops the vehicle through an autonomous driving unit.
