DETECTION APPARATUS AND METHOD, AND IMAGE PROCESSING APPARATUS AND SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A detection method including extracting features from an image, detecting a human in the image based on the extracted features, detecting an object in a surrounding region of the detected human based on the extracted features and determining human-object interaction information in the image based on the extracted features, the detected human and the detected object. The detection speed and detection precision of detecting the human, object and human-object interaction relationship from the video/image can be enhanced, and therefore the timeliness and accuracy of offering help to the human in need of help can be better met.

<claims>
1. A detection apparatus comprising: a feature extraction unit which extracts features from an image; a human detection unit which detects a human in the image based on the features; an object detection unit which detects an object in a surrounding region of the detected human based on the features; and an interaction determination unit which determines human-object interaction information in the image based on the features, the detected human and the detected object.
2. The detection apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the human detection unit and the object detection unit are configured to detect regions of the human and the object or detect key points of the human and the object.
3. The detection apparatus according to claim 2, wherein at least one part of the detected human is determined based on a type of an object to be detected; wherein, the surrounding region is a region surrounding the determined at least one part.
4. The detection apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the determined at least one part is the lower-half-body of the detected human.
5. The detection apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the surrounding region is determined by determining a human pose of the detected human.
6. The detection apparatus according to claim 3, wherein in a case where the key points of the human are detected, the surrounding region is a region surrounding at least one of the key points of the human.
7. The detection apparatus according to claim 1, wherein, the feature extraction unit, the human detection unit, the object detection unit and the interaction determination unit execute corresponding operations by using a pre-generated neural network.
8. A detection method comprising: a feature extraction step of extracting features from an image; a human detection step of detecting a human in the image based on the features; an object detection step of detecting an object in a surrounding region of the detected human based on the features; and an interaction determination step of determining a human-object interaction information in the image based on the features, the detected human and the detected object.
9. The detection method according to claim 8, wherein the human detection step and the object detection step are configured to detect regions of the human and the object or detect key points of the human and the object.
10. The detection method according to claim 9, wherein at least one part of the detected human is determined based on a type of an object to be detected, wherein the surrounding region is a region surrounding the determined at least one part.
11. The detection method according to claim 10, wherein the surrounding region is determined by determining a human pose of the detected human
12. The detection method according to claim 10, wherein in a case where the key points of the human are detected, the surrounding region is a region surrounding at least one of the key points of the human.
13. An image processing apparatus comprising: an acquisition device for acquiring an image or a video; a storage device which stores instructions; and a processor which executes the instructions based on the acquired image or video, such that the processor implements at least the detection method according to claim 8.
14. An image processing system comprising: an acquisition apparatus for acquiring an image or a video; a detection apparatus including a feature extraction unit which extracts features from an image, a human detection unit which detects a human in the image based on the features, an object detection unit which detects an object in a surrounding region of the detected human based on the features and an interaction determination unit which determines human-object interaction information in the image based on the features, the detected human and the detected object, for detecting the human, object and human-object interaction information from the acquired image or video; and a processing apparatus for executing subsequent image processing operations based on the detected human-object interaction information, wherein, the acquisition apparatus, the detection apparatus and the processing apparatus are connected to each other via a network.
