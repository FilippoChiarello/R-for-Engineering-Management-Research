<title>
METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PERFORMING SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION OF PLURALITY OF ENTITIES IN AN IMAGE
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to a method and system for performing semantic segmentation of plurality of entities in an image. In an embodiment, the present disclosure discloses identifying a Weak Region of Interest (WRoI) comprising at least one smaller entity enclosed within a larger entity using a first model of a neural network. Further, a location of center of the WRoI is estimated for weakly predicting a portion of the larger entity. Thereafter, the portion of the larger entity is dynamically cropped from the WRoI and analyzed using a second model of the neural network for segmenting each of the plurality of entities in the image. In an embodiment, the present disclosure helps in segmenting multiple entities in an image using a weakly predicted portion of a larger entity in the image, thereby reducing the computational complexity involved in segmentation of the plurality of entities.

<claims>
1. A method of semantic segmentation of a plurality of entities in an image, the method comprising:
identifying, by a segmentation system, a Weak Region of Interest (WRoI), comprising at least one smaller entity enclosed within a larger entity, in the image by analyzing the image using a first model of a neural network, trained for predicting the WRoI;
estimating, by the segmentation system, a location of center of the WRoI for weakly predicting a portion of the larger entity;
dynamically cropping, by the segmentation system, the portion of the larger entity from the WRoI; and
analyzing, by the segmentation system, the cropped portion of the larger entity using a second model of the neural network, trained for segmenting each of the at least one smaller entity and the larger entity, thereby segmenting each of the plurality of entities in the image.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the neural network comprises encoders, decoders and encoder-decoder parameters corresponding to the first model and the second model of the neural network.
3. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein dynamically cropping the portion of the larger entity is based on a predetermined cropping factor dynamically selected based on size of the image.
4. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein segmenting the at least one smaller entity and the larger entity comprises:
extracting the portion of the larger entity using a first set of encoders and a first set of decoders corresponding to the second model of the neural network; and extracting region of the at least one smaller entity from the portion of the larger entity using the first set of encoders and a second set of decoders corresponding to the second model of the neural network, wherein the first set of decoders is different from the second set of decoders.
5. The method as claimed in claim 1 further comprises mapping each of the plurality of segmented entities with the image for generating segmentation results, indicating location of each of the plurality of entities within the image.
6. A segmentation system for performing semantic segmentation of a plurality of entities in an image, the segmentation system comprises:

7. The segmentation system as claimed in claim 6, wherein the neural network comprises encoders, decoders and encoder-decoder parameters corresponding to the first model and the second model of the neural network.
8. The segmentation system as claimed in claim 6, wherein dynamically cropping the portion of the larger entity is based on a predetermined cropping factor dynamically selected based on size of the image.
