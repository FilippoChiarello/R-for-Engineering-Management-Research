<title>
Targeted e-commerce business strategies based on affiliation networks derived from predictive cognitive traits
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments are directed to a computer implemented business campaign development system. The system includes an electronic tool configured to hold data of a user, and an analyzer circuit configured to derive a cognitive trait of the user based at least in part on the data of the user. The system further includes a targeted business strategy development system configured to derive a targeted business strategy based at least in part on the cognitive trait of the user.

<claims>
1. A computer system configured to identify and communicate with an ad hoc affinity network of individuals, the computer system comprising: an electronic tool having a processor circuit communicatively coupled to a memory; wherein the processor circuit and the memory are configured to hold text data of a user; wherein the processor circuit is configured to perform an ad hoc affinity network identification method comprising: using a graphical text analyzer circuit to derive cognitive trait data representing a cognitive trait of the user based at least in part on the text data of the user; wherein the cognitive trait data comprises a representation of measures of the user's total behavior over a period of time within a lower dimensional feature space; wherein the graphical text analyzer circuit comprises a graphical text analysis module communicatively coupled to a learning engine and a predictive engine; wherein the graphical text analysis module of the graphical text analyzer circuit is configured to apply feature extraction techniques to generate word graphs; and wherein the feature extraction techniques comprise reducing the set of behavioral measures of the user over the period of time to a set of feature nodes and vectors that correspond to representations in the lower dimensional feature space of the set of behavioral measures of the user over the period of time; based at least in part on the learning engine receiving multiple instances of the word graphs, applying, using the learning engine, classifier training techniques to the multiple instances of the word graphs to generate and continuously refine a cognitive trait model of the user; based at least in part on the predictive engine receiving the word graphs and the cognitive trait model of the user, predicting, using the predictive engine, a predicted cognitive trait of the user; wherein the predicted cognitive trait of the user comprises the representations in the lower dimensional feature space of the set of behavioral measures of the user over the period of time; and determining, using a decision engine of the computing system, based at least in part on the predicted cognitive trait of the user, that the user is a member of the ad hoc affinity network of individuals; wherein all members of the ad hoc affinity network of individuals share the predicted cognitive trait; wherein the processor circuit is configured to perform a communications method for generating communications for the ad hoc affinity network identification, the communications method comprising: transforming the cognitive trait data into an artificial agent configured and arranged to communicate with the user in a manner that reflects the predicted cognitive trait of the user; identifying a nexus between a desired outcome and the predicted cognitive trait that is shared by all members of the ad hoc affinity network; generating a communication targeted to the members of the ad hoc affinity network based at least in part on the nexus between the desired outcome and the predicted cognitive trait that is shared by all members of the ad hoc affinity network; and providing the communication to the user using the artificial agent.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein all members of the ad hoc affinity network of individuals have been selected for and included in the ad hoc affinity network based on application of the feature extraction techniques individually to each of a plurality of users.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the user comprises a super-organism.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the super-organism comprises the user and a merchant.
5. The system of claim 3, wherein the super-organism comprises the user and an artificial agent.
6. A computer program product for identifying and communicating with an ad hoc affinity network of individuals, the computer program product comprising: a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, wherein the computer readable storage medium is not a transitory signal per se, the program instructions readable by a processor circuit to cause the processor circuit to perform a method comprising: storing, using a memory of the processor circuit, text data generated by a user; deriving, using a graphical text analyzer of the processor circuit, cognitive trait data representing a cognitive trait of the user based at least in part on the text data generated by the user; wherein the cognitive trait data comprises a representation of measures of the user's total behavior over a period of time within a lower dimensional feature space; wherein the graphical text analyzer circuit comprises a graphical text analysis module communicatively coupled to a learning engine and a predictive engine; wherein the graphical text analysis module of the graphical text analyzer circuit is configured to apply feature extraction techniques to generate word graphs; wherein the feature extraction techniques comprise reducing the set of behavioral measures of the user over the period of time to a set of feature nodes and vectors that correspond to representations in the lower dimensional feature space of the set of behavioral measures of the user over the period of time; based at least in part on the learning engine receiving multiple instances of the word graphs, applying, using the learning engine, classifier training techniques to the multiple instances of the word graphs to generate and continuously refine a cognitive trait model of the user; based at least in part on the predictive engine receiving the word graphs and the cognitive trait model of the user, predicting, using the predictive engine, a predicted cognitive trait of the user; wherein the predicted cognitive trait of the user comprises the representations in the lower dimensional feature space of the set of behavioral measures of the user over the period of time; determining, using a decision engine of the processor system, based at least in part on the predicted cognitive trait of the user, that the user is a member of the ad hoc affinity network of individuals; wherein all members of the ad hoc affinity network of individuals share the predicted cognitive trait; transforming the cognitive trait data into an artificial agent configured and arranged to communicate with the user in a manner that reflects the predicted cognitive trait of the user; identifying a nexus between a desired outcome and the predicted cognitive trait that is shared by all members of the ad hoc affinity network; generating a communication targeted to the members of the ad hoc affinity network based at least in part on the nexus between the desired outcome and the predicted cognitive trait that is shared by all members of the ad hoc affinity network; providing the communication to the user using the artificial agent.
7. The computer program product of claim 6, wherein all members of the ad hoc affinity network of individuals have been selected for and included in the ad hoc affinity network based on application of the computer implemented method of claim 1 individually to each of a plurality of users.
8. The computer program product of claim 7, wherein determining that the user is a member of the ad hoc affinity network of individual is further based at least in part on identifying a nexus between a desired outcome and the predictive cognitive trait that the members of the ad hoc affinity network have in common.
