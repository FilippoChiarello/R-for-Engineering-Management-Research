ANOMALY DETECTION METHOD, SYSTEM, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention provides an anomaly detection method, an anomaly detection system, and an anomaly detection program that can detect an anomaly at high accuracy by using log output quantity distributions generated for to different aggregate units and different devices. An anomaly detection system according to one example embodiment of the present invention has: a reference distribution, which is a time-series distribution of a log output quantity acquisition unit that acquires a plurality of distributions generated for each device that outputs logs and for each unit of a time range in which logs are aggregated; and an anomaly detection unit that detects an anomaly by using the plurality of distributions.
