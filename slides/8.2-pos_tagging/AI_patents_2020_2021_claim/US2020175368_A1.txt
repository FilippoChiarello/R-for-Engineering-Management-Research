SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR NOISE-BASED TRAINING OF A PREDICTION MODEL
</title>

<abstract>
In some embodiments, noise data may be used to train a neural network (or other prediction model). In some embodiments, input noise data may be obtained and provided to a prediction model to obtain an output related to the input noise data (e.g., the output being a prediction related to the input noise data). One or more target output indications may be provided as reference feedback to the prediction model to update one or more portions of the prediction model, wherein the one or more portions of the prediction model are updated based on the related output and the target indications. Subsequent to the portions of the prediction model being updated, a data item may be provided to the prediction model to obtain a prediction related to the data item (e.g., a different version of the data item, a location of an aspect in the data item, etc.).

<claims>
1. A method being implemented by one or more processors configured to execute one or more computer program instructions that, when executed, perform the method, the method comprising: obtaining first noise data and second noise data, wherein the second noise data comprises a modified version of the first noise data or the first noise data comprises a modified version of the second noise data; providing the second noise data to a prediction model to obtain a reconstruction of the first noise data, the reconstruction comprising noise data; and providing the first noise data to the prediction model as reference feedback to update one or more configurations of the prediction model, wherein the one or more configurations are updated based on the first noise data and the reconstruction of the first noise data.

4. The method of claim 2, wherein: the data item comprises a Magnetic Resonance Imaging ("MRI") image that includes one or more aberrations; and the different version of the data item does not include the one or more aberrations in the MRI image.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the one or more aberrations comprise at least one of: distortions to the MRI image, vignetting to the MRI image, and chromatic aberrations.
6. The method of claim 2, wherein the data item includes at least some aberrations, and the different version of the data item is a version of the data item having a reduction in the at least some aberrations.
