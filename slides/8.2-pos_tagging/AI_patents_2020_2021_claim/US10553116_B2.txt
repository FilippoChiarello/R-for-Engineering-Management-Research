<title>
Method for detecting right lane area and left lane area of rear of vehicle using region of interest and image monitoring system for vehicle using the same
</title>

<abstract>
An image monitoring system for vehicle for detecting a left lane area and a right lane area behind a vehicle using a region of interest (ROI) is provided. The system includes a rear camera, a memory configured to store an image obtained from the rear camera, and a controller configured to be set to one of a driving mode and a parking mode based on whether the vehicle is traveling and to detect an event from the image obtained from the rear camera. The controller set to the driving mode sets the ROI corresponding to the left lane area and the right lane area behind the vehicle on the image obtained from the rear camera, while the vehicle is traveling, detects whether an object is located on or enters the ROI, and notifies a driver of the vehicle of the detected result using an alarm.

<claims>
1. An image monitoring system for vehicle for detecting a left lane area and a right lane area behind a vehicle using a region of interest (ROI), the system comprising: a rear camera; a memory configured to store an image obtained from the rear camera; and a controller configured to be set to one of a driving mode and a parking mode based on whether the vehicle is traveling and to detect an event from the image obtained from the rear camera, wherein the controller set to the driving mode sets the ROI corresponding to the left lane area and the right lane area behind the vehicle on the image obtained from the rear camera, while the vehicle is traveling, detects whether an object is located on or enters the ROI, and notifies a driver of the vehicle of the detected result using an alarm, wherein the controller does not set the ROI if a shadow of the object is not found from the image obtained from the rear camera, wherein the controller set to the driving mode sets the ROI based on left lane information and right lane information detected from the image obtained from the rear camera if the shadow of the object is found from the image obtained from the rear camera, wherein the controller set to the driving mode determines the ROI in at least one of location, form, size, or number using shadow information of the object, wherein the controller set to the driving mode calculates blind spots of side mirrors and a room mirror of the vehicle between the left lane area and the right lane area behind the vehicle based on the left lane information and the right lane information detected from the image obtained from the rear camera and location information of a vanishing point on the image obtained from the rear camera and sets a region including the calculated blind spots to the ROI.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the controller set to the driving mode detects whether the object is located on the ROI by extracting a feature from the ROI using at least one of a histogram of gradients (HOG) technique or an Haar-like feature technique and identifying the object using at least one of a support vector machine (SVM) technique, an Adaboost technique, or an artificial neural network (ANN) technique.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the controller set to the driving mode sets parameters used for the HOG technique based on appearance information previously constructed for each of a plurality of objects including the object, if using the HOG technique.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the controller set to the driving mode recognizes a change of appearance information or identification information of the object, or detects whether the object enters the ROI or whether the object is traveling at the same speed as the vehicle on the ROI by calculating a motion vector of the object.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the controller set to the driving mode recognizes the change of the appearance information or the identification information of the object or detects whether the object departs from the ROI by calculating the motion vector of the object, if the object is located on the ROI.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the controller set to the driving mode detects whether the object is located on or enters one of a first area of a distance or more from the vehicle, which is not recognized by the driver through side mirrors of the vehicle and is captured by the rear camera, a second area of less than the distance from the vehicle, which is not recognized by the driver through the side mirrors and is captured by the rear camera, or a third area which is not recognized by the driver through the side mirrors and is not captured by the rear camera.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the controller set to the driving mode recognizes a change of appearance information or identification information of the object or detects whether the object enters the third area by calculating a motion vector of the object, if the object is located on the second area in the ROI.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein, after detecting that the object enters the third area and notifying the driver of the vehicle of the detected result using the alarm, the controller set to the driving mode clears the alarm, if detecting that the object departs from the third area.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the controller set to the driving mode detects that the object departs from the third area, using an image obtained from a front camera included in the image monitoring system for vehicle or the image obtained from the rear camera.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the ROI is set in at least one of location, form, size, or number based on at least one of left lane information and right lane information detected from the image obtained from the rear camera, location information of a vanishing point on the image obtained from the rear camera, appearance information of the object located on the image obtained from the rear camera, a speed calculated by the controller, or power consumed by the controller.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the controller set to the driving mode detects whether the object is located on or enters the ROI for each frame or at intervals of a time, while the vehicle is traveling.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein the controller set to the driving mode notifies the driver of the vehicle of the detected result using the alarm through at least one of a display device or an audio device installed in the vehicle.
