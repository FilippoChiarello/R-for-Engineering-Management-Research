COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED PROCESS AND SYSTEM FOR GENERATING RECOMMENDATIONS RELATING TO USER EXPERIENCES OF ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented process and system are provided. The process and system provide recommendations for the creation or modification of a user experience of a candidate entertainment production, destined to a plurality of end-users or consumers, in view of user experiences associated to one or more other entertainment productions. Recommendations of changes to apply on the human-interpretable UX-metrics of the candidate entertainment production are automatically generated based on similarities or differences between the candidate's transformed UX-data and a target UX-template and/or ii) the human interpretable UX-metrics of the candidate entertainment production and of the UX-template.
