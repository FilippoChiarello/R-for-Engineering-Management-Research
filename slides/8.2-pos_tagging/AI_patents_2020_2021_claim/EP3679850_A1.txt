ROBOT CLEANER, ROBOT CLEANING SYSTEM HAVING THE SAME
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a robot cleaner and to a method for operating the robot cleaner. To provide an robot cleaner and a method for operating the robot cleaner allowing an improved cleaning process avoiding any undesired cleaning operation and preferably providing a possibility for an interaction with the user, even if the user has left the apartment or could not manually control the robot cleaner, an robot cleaner (10) is provided, comprising: a main body (210) having a suction port; a travelling device (280) to move the main body (210); a cleaning device or brush assembly (245) installed on the main body (210); a controller (270); a communication unit (222) adapted to transmit cleaning status information to a remote device (600) and to receive cleaning command information from a remote device (300); at least one sensor (180, 190, 195) sensing the floor to be cleaned and providing cleanliness information to the controller (270); wherein the controller (270) is adapted to determine whether to stop cleaning operation or whether to continue the cleaning operation based on the cleanliness information and (or) based on the cleaning command information.

<claims>
1. A robot cleaner (200) comprising: a traveling unit (280) configured to move a main body; a cleaning unit (245) configured to execute cleaning; at least one a camera (230) configured to capture an image including foreign substances or sense the foreign substances; a communication unit (222) configured to exchange data with a mobile terminal (600) or a server (500); a controller (270) configured to execute cleaning of an area around the foreign substances based on cleaning execution information regarding the foreign substances or to execute no cleaning of the area around the foreign substances based on cleaning avoidance information regarding the foreign substances; and a memory (243) connected to the controller (270), and to store image or data, wherein the memory (243) is configured to store an image or pattern of foreign material which should stop cleaning operation.
2. The robot cleaner according to claim 1, wherein the controller (270) is configured to: detect a foreign substance in an image captured by the camera (230) control the memory (243) to store an image or a pattern of foreign material which should stop the cleaning operation.
3. The robot cleaner according to claim 1, wherein the controller (270) is configured to decide whether detected or sensed foreign material is critical or not based on storing image or pattern of foreign material which should stop the cleaning operation.
4. The robot cleaner according to claim 1, wherein the controller (270) is configured to: compare an image captured by the camera with the stored image in the memory, and control transmission of captured image to the mobile terminal or to the server if a difference between the captured image and the stored image is a designated value or more.
5. The robot cleaner according to claim 1, wherein the controller (270) is configured to compare an image captured by the camera with the stored image in the memory to decide whether to stop or whether to continue the cleaning operation.
6. The robot cleaner according to claim 1, wherein the controller (270) is configured to: transmit cleaning status information to the mobile terminal (600) or the server (500), receive cleaning command information from the mobile terminal (600) or the server (500), and provide an adaptive learning process based on processing the cleaning command information.
7. The robot cleaner according to claim 1, wherein the controller (270) is configured to: detect a foreign substance in an image captured by the camera (230), receive a cleaning command for continuing the cleaning operation regarding the detected foreign substance from the mobile terminal (600) or the server (500), after once receiving the cleaning command regarding the detected foreign substance, store the image captured from camera (230) or transmitted status information to the memory (243).
8. The robot cleaner according to claim 1, wherein the controller (270) is configured to: control transmission of the image including the foreign substances and image related information to the mobile terminal (600) or to the server (500), execute cleaning of an area around the foreign substances based on cleaning execution information regarding the foreign substances or execute no cleaning of the area around the foreign substances based on cleaning avoidance information regarding the foreign substances, transmitted from the mobile terminal (600) or the server (500).
9. The robot cleaner according to claim 1, wherein the controller (270) is configured to control transmission of a conversation-type message to the mobile terminal (600) or the server.
10. The robot cleaner according to claim 1 or 8, wherein the controller (270) is configured to control transmission of cleaning completion information to the mobile terminal (600), after completion of cleaning of the area around the foreign substances according to the cleaning execution information.
11. The robot cleaner according to claim 1 or 8, wherein the controller (270) is configured to control transmission of response information corresponding to the cleaning avoidance information to the mobile terminal (600).
12. The robot cleaner according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the controller (270) is configured to control operation of the camera (230) during an automatic traveling mode or an automatic cleaning mode, and to control transmission of the image including the foreign substances and the image related information to the mobile terminal (600) or the server if the image including the foreign substances is acquired from the camera (230).
13. The robot cleaner according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the controller (270) is configured to control operation of the camera (230) based on an image capture command from the mobile terminal (600) and controls transmission of an image captured by the camera (230) to the mobile terminal (600).
14. A robot cleaning system (50) comprising: a robot cleaner (200) according to any one of claims 1 to 13; and a mobile terminal (600) configured to display an image received from the robot cleaner (200) and to transmit cleaning execution information or cleaning avoidance information to the robot cleaner (200) based on the displayed image.
