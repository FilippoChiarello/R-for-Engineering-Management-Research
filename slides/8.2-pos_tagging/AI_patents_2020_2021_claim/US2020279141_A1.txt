EXTRACTION METHOD, EXTRACTION DEVICE, AND COMPUTER-READABLE RECORDING MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium stores therein an extraction program that causes a computer to execute a process including: generating a plurality of combinations of conditions relating to a plurality of item values included in data; calculating an index value that indicates a degree of cooccurrence between a specified response variable and each of the plurality of combinations, by using a machine learning model that estimates a response variable from the plurality of item values, the machine learning model having been trained by using the data; and extracting a specific combination from among the plurality of combinations based on any one of the condition and the index value.

<claims>
1. A non-transitory computer-readable recording medium storing therein an extraction program that causes a computer to execute a process comprising: generating a plurality of combinations of conditions relating to a plurality of item values included in data; calculating an index value that indicates a degree of cooccurrence between a specified response variable and each of the plurality of combinations, by using a machine learning model that estimates a response variable from the plurality of item values, the machine learning model having been trained by using the data; and extracting a specific combination from among the plurality of combinations based on any one of the condition and the index value.
2. The non-transitory computer-readable recording medium according to claim 1, wherein the generating includes generating a combination of a response variable and a condition relating to one or more explanatory variables corresponding to the response variable, and the calculating includes calculating a plausibility of the response variable of satisfying the condition per combination, as the index value.
3. The non-transitory computer-readable recording medium according to claim 1, wherein the extracting includes extracting a combination, the index value of which is equal to or higher than a predetermined value, from among the combinations.
4. The non-transitory computer-readable recording medium according to claim 1, wherein the process further includes displaying a list of the combinations extracted at the extracting, while emphasizing a first combination compared to other combinations when the index value of the first combination, which is a combination of a first condition and another condition, is higher than a first criterion, and when the index value of only the first condition is equal to or lower than a second criterion, out of the combinations extracted at the extracting.
5. The non-transitory computer-readable recording medium according to claim 1, wherein the generating includes generating a combination of conditions, a frequency of which of matching with the data is equal to or higher than a predetermined value, out of the conditions.
6. The non-transitory computer-readable recording medium according to claim 1, wherein the generating includes generating a combination of conditions relating to a plurality of item values included in data that increases as time passes.
7. An extraction method executed by a computer, the extraction method comprising: generating a plurality of combinations of conditions relating to a plurality of item values included in data; calculating an index value that indicates a degree of cooccurrence between a specified response variable and each of the plurality of combinations, by using a machine learning model that estimates a response variable from the plurality of item values, the machine learning model having been trained by using the data; and extracting a specific combination from among the plurality of combinations based on any one of the condition and the index value.
8. An extraction device comprising: a processor configured to: generate a plurality of combinations of conditions relating to a plurality of item values included in data; calculate an index value that indicates a degree of cooccurrence between a specified response variable and each of the plurality of combinations, by using a machine learning model that estimates a response variable from the plurality of item values, the machine learning model having been trained by using the data; and extract a specific combination from among the plurality of combinations based on any one of the condition and the index value.
