<title>
SMART SHINGLES
</title>

<abstract>
At least one shingle is integrated with logic circuitry and various other components which enable high-level functionality and automated system diagnostics. Each shingle can automatically determine its absolute position on a rooftop and/or its position relative to other shingles in the smart shingle system. Each shingle can also detect various changes in its own power generation, efficiency, and/or operating conditions, as well as those of neighboring shingles. Each shingle can then leverage this information to conduct system diagnostics and possibly to generate and/or execute recommended solutions. In another embodiment, each shingle can be coupled to a centralized controller which can perform the same automapping and diagnostic functions. The controller can also monitor the power usage of the building to help optimize the power generation of the smart shingle system. In some embodiments, the smart shingle system can be outfitted with heating components and/or actuators to help automate the process of keeping the smart shingles clear of debris.

<claims>
1. A system of smart shingles located on a building and capable of automated system diagnostics, comprising: a first shingle that comprises: a processor that executes computer executable components stored in a memory; a solar collector; and a location component that determines relative position of the first shingle to a second shingle of the system.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the first shingle comprises an artificial intelligence component that employs inferential logic.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the first shingle comprises an artificial intelligence component that pattern recognition.
4. The system of claim 2, wherein the artificial intelligence component diagnoses problems with first shingle.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the first shingle generates a recommended solutions for the problem.
6. The system of claim 4, wherein the first shingle receives information from a pressure sensor or light sensor, and determines whether an object resting on the surface of the first shingle.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the first shingle sends a notification that sunlight is being blocked due to an obstruction.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the first shingle sends a notification to remove snow from the first shingle.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the first shingle comprises an efficiency sensor component that determines an efficiency at which the first shingle generates electricity.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the first shingle comprises a temperature sensor component that detects at least one of a temperature of a surface of the first shingle or an ambient temperature associated with the first shingle.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the first shingle comprises a pressure sensor component that determines at least one of an amount of pressure or an amount of force that is applied to a surface of the first shingle.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein the first shingle comprises a light sensor component that detects presence of light or an amount of light incident on a surface of the first shingle.
13. The system of claim 1, wherein the first shingle comprises a moisture sensor component that detects at least one of amount of liquid, moisture, or humidity on a surface of the first shingle.
14. The system of claim 1, wherein the first shingle further comprises an inter-shingle communication component that facilitates the first shingle to leverage data collected by at least one of a sensor component or a location component of another shingle in the system.
15. The system of claim 14, further comprising at least one of: a heating component, located inside or outside the first shingle, wherein the heating component generates heat by consuming electricity and can be used to help keep the first shingle clear of snow or ice accumulation; an actuator component, located inside or outside the at least one shingle, wherein the actuator component can perform at least one of: clearing the at least one shingle of a debris other than snow or ice accumulation; or adjusting an angle of incidence between the at least one shingle and a light that is at least partially incident on the at least one shingle; or an LED component, wherein the LED component is capable of displaying at least one light that is visible from an external view of the at least one shingle.
16. A roof shingle, comprising: a processor that executes computer executable components stored in a memory; a solar collector; and a location component that determines relative position of the roof shingle to a second shingle.
17. The roof shingle of claim 16, further comprising an artificial intelligence component that diagnoses problems with roof shingle.
18. The system of claim 16, wherein the roof shingle sends a notification that sunlight is being blocked due to an obstruction.
19. A system, comprising: a first shingle that comprises: a processor that executes computer executable components stored in a memory; a solar collector; a location component that determines relative position of the first shingle to a second shingle of the system; and a controller, wherein the first shingle is communicatively coupled to the controller and wherein the controller comprises: a processor that executed computer executable instructions stored in computer-readable memory to perform acts, comprising: determining a neighboring shingle of the first shingle; monitoring data gathered by at least one sensor component of the first shingle; and performing system diagnostics for the first shingle.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein the controller further comprises a power regulation component, wherein the power regulation component controls amount of electricity channeled to or from the first shingle.
