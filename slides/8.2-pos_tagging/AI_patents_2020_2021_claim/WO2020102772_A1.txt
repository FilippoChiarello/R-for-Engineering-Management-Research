<title>
COORDINATE ESTIMATION ON N-SPHERES WITH SPHERICAL REGRESSION
</title>

<abstract>
A method for labeling a spherical target includes receiving an input including a representation of an object. The method also includes estimating unconstrained coordinates corresponding to the object. The method further includes estimating coordinates on a sphere by applying a spherical exponential activation function to the unconstrained coordinates. The method also associates the input with a set of values corresponding to a spherical target based on the estimated coordinates on the sphere.
