CROSS-SENSOR PREDICTIVE INFERENCE
</title>

<abstract>
There is a need for solutions for efficiently and reliably perform sensor-based predictive data analysis. This need can be addressed by, for example, solutions for performing cross-sensor predictive data analysis. In one example, a method for performing cross-sensor predictive data analysis includes identifying sensor input data objects comprising one or more image data objects; determining sensor feature data objects based on the sensor input data objects; generating predictions for a target predictive entity associated with the sensor input data objects by processing the sensor feature data objects using a cross-sensor predictive inference model; and performing prediction-based actions based on the cross-sensor predictions.
