DRIVING ASSISTANCE DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
In a driving assistance device, a human body specifying unit acquires, as human body information, an image of a human body existing around a host vehicle in image data acquired by a camera. A quasi-skeleton estimation unit estimates a quasi-skeleton of the human body from the human body information. The radar or the LiDAR measures a distance to a part of the human body that corresponds to the quasi-skeleton.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A driving assistance device configured to assist driving of a movable body, comprising: a visual sensor configured to acquire an image around the movable body; a distance measurement sensor configured to measure a distance to an object around the movable body; a human body information acquisition unit configured to acquire, as human body information, an image of a human body existing around the movable body in the image acquired by the visual sensor; and a quasi-skeleton estimation unit configured to estimate a quasi-skeleton of the human body from the human body information, wherein the distance measurement sensor is configured to measure a distance to a part of the human body that corresponds to the quasi-skeleton.
2. The driving assistance device according to claim 1, wherein: the quasi-skeleton includes a human body characteristic part including at least a hand or a head of the human body, and a quasi-joint part; and the distance measurement sensor is configured to measure a distance to a part of the human body that corresponds to the human body characteristic part or the quasi-joint part.
3. The driving assistance device according to claim 2, further comprising a human body recognition process unit configured to recognize the human body on the basis of the distance to the human body measured by the distance measurement sensor and the human body information, wherein: the quasi-skeleton includes the human body characteristic part, a plurality of the quasi-joint parts, and axis parts that connect between the human body characteristic part and the quasi-joint parts in accordance with a human body skeleton structure; the distance measurement sensor is configured to further measure a distance to a part of the human body that corresponds to the axis part; and when the distance to the part of the human body that corresponds to the axis part and the distance to the part of the human body that corresponds to the human body characteristic part or the quasi-joint part are different, the human body recognition process unit is configured to recognize the human body by using the distance to the part of the human body that corresponds to the axis part giving priority thereto.
4. The driving assistance device according to claim 1, wherein when the human body information acquisition unit is able to acquire the human body information but it is difficult for the quasi-skeleton estimation unit to estimate the quasi-skeleton from the human body information, the distance measurement sensor is configured to measure a distance to a peripheral part of the movable body that corresponds to a frame surrounding the human body information.
5. The driving assistance device according to claim 1, wherein the distance measurement sensor is configured to measure a distance to a part of the human body that corresponds to a region that is a predetermined distance away from the quasi-skeleton.
6. The driving assistance device according to claim 1, wherein: the human body includes a pedestrian, a driver of other movable body including a two-wheeled or four-wheeled vehicle, or a traffic control person who controls a traffic flow; and the visual sensor is configured to acquire the image of the human body in a range adjacent to a road where the movable body travels.
