<title>
Systems and methods for analyzing resource production
</title>

<abstract>
A method of producing fluids from a geological structure includes receiving field information associated with producing wells of a field; deriving a field specific model based on the field information, the field specific model including a proximity depletion synthetic variable and a fraction hit synthetic variable; identifying a proposed location based on the application of field management engine to the field specific model, the field management engine projecting a decrease in production from wells proximal to the location and projecting an improvement in a production objective; and drilling a well at the proposed location.

<claims>
1. A method of producing fluids from a geological structure, the method comprising: receiving field information associated with producing wells in a field, the field having field characteristics including geological, geophysical, petrophysical, lithological, and mineralogical characteristics, a first portion of the field information being received in a form of structured data, and a second portion of the field information being received in a form of unstructured data; transforming the unstructured data into transformed structured data; based on the received field information in the form of the structured data and the transformed structured data, building a plurality of field-specific models, each of the plurality of field-specific models being specific to the field characteristics of the field; selecting one of the plurality of field-specific models, the selected field-specific model including a proximity depletion synthetic variable and a fracturing (frac) hit synthetic variable; iteratively identifying, based on the selected field-specific model and using a field management engine, two or more proposed locations for a proposed well; for each of the two or more proposed locations for the proposed well: projecting, based on the selected field-specific model and using the field management engine, a decrease in production from one or more of the producing wells located proximal to the respective proposed location; and projecting, based on the selected field-specific model and using the field management engine, a production amount associated with a well drilled at the respective proposed location; selecting, using the field management engine, one of the two or more proposed locations for the proposed well, the selected location for the proposed well having the projected production amount that exceeds the projected decrease in production; and drilling the proposed well at the selected location.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the field information includes production values and well locations.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the well location includes horizontal placement.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the field information includes geological information.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the field-specific model further includes a fracking order synthetic variable.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising projecting a production of a plurality of wells associated with the field.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein selecting the one of the plurality of field-specific models comprises: receiving information associated with a further one or more wells within the field; determining a test set of information from the received information associated with the further one or more wells within the field, and validating each of the plurality of field-specific models using the test set of information; and based on results of the validation, selecting the one of the plurality of field-specific models.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein each of the plurality of field-specific models includes one or more machine learning models.
9. A method of producing fluids from a geological structure, the method comprising: receiving field information associated with producing wells in a field, the field having field characteristics including geological, geophysical, petrophysical, lithological, and mineralogical characteristics; based on the received field information, building a plurality of field-specific models, each of the plurality of field-specific models being specific to the field characteristics of the field; selecting one of the plurality of field-specific models; iteratively identifying, based on the selected field-specific model and using a field management engine, two or more proposed locations for a proposed well in the field; for each of the two or more proposed locations for the proposed well: projecting, based on the selected field-specific model and using the field management engine, a decrease in production from one or more of the producing wells located proximal to the respective proposed location; and projecting, based on the selected field-specific model and using the field management engine, a production amount associated with a well drilled at the respective proposed location; selecting, using the field management engine, one of the two or more proposed locations for the proposed well, the selected location for the proposed well having the projected production amount that exceeds the projected decrease in production; and drilling the proposed well at the selected location.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the field information includes production values and well locations.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the well location includes horizontal placement.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein the field information includes geological information.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein the selected field-specific model includes a fracking order synthetic variable.
14. The method of claim 9, wherein selecting the one of the plurality of field-specific models comprises: receiving information associated with a further one or more wells within the field; determining a test set of information from the received information associated with the further one or more wells within the field, and validating each of the plurality of field-specific models using the test set of information; and based on results of the validation, selecting the one of the plurality of field-specific models.
15. The method of claim 9, wherein each of the plurality of field-specific models includes one or more machine learning models.
