COMMUNITY MONITORING SYSTEM AND METHOD TO OPERATE THE SAME
</title>

<abstract>
A system for community monitoring is disclosed. The system includes a community processing subsystem. The community processing subsystem includes an entity control module, configured to control each of plurality of tasks corresponding to one of a plurality of entities. The community processing subsystem also includes a task monitoring module, configured to monitor each of the plurality of tasks corresponding to one of the plurality of entities by entity associated techniques. The community processing subsystem also includes an information exchange module, configured to exchange information within the plurality of entities. A community memory subsystem is configured to store details regarding monitored plurality of tasks corresponding to one of the plurality of entities in real time. Present disclosure enables proper monitoring of every possible entity in a society through a common platform.

<claims>
WE CLAIM:
1. A system for community monitoring (10), comprising: a community processing subsystem (20), comprising: an entity control module (40) configured to control each of plurality of tasks corresponding to one of a plurality of entities; a task monitoring module (50) operatively coupled to the entity control module (40), and configured to monitor each of the plurality of tasks corresponding to one of the plurality of entities by entity associated techniques; an information exchange module (60) operatively coupled to the entity control module (50), and configured to exchange information within the plurality of entities; and a community memory subsystem (30) operatively coupled to a community processing subsystem (20), and configured to store details regarding monitored plurality of tasks corresponding to one of the plurality of entities in real time.
2. The system (10) as claimed in claim 1, further comprises a community registration module operatively coupled with the entity control module (40), and configured to registered a plurality of users associated with a community.
3. The system (10) as claimed in claim 1, further comprises a notification module operatively coupled to the task monitoring module (50), and configured to notify monitored result to each of the plurality of users associated with the community.
4. The system (10) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the plurality of entities comprises at least one of parking management of the community, surveillance management of the community, entry and exit management of the community, water management of the community and common space management of the community.
5. A method for monitoring plurality of entities in relation to a community (170), comprising: registering, by a community registration module, a plurality of users associated with the community (180); controlling, by an entity control module, each of plurality of tasks corresponding to one of the plurality of entities (190); monitoring, by a task monitoring module, each of the plurality of tasks corresponding to one of the plurality of entities by entity associated techniques (200); exchanging, by an information exchange module, information within the plurality of entities (210); and notifying, by a notification module, monitored result to each of the plurality of users associated with the community (220).
6. The method (170) as claimed in claim 5, monitoring, by the task monitoring module, the plurality of entities comprises at least one of parking management of the community, surveillance management of the community, entry and exit management of the community, water management of the community and common space management of the community.
7. The method (170) as claimed in claim 5, further comprises storing, by a community memory subsystem, details regarding monitored plurality of tasks corresponding to one of the plurality of entities in real time.
