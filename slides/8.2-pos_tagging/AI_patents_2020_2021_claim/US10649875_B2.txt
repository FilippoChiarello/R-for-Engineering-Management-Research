<title>
Providing recommendation(s) for a computing device executing a gaming application
</title>

<abstract>
In some examples, a server may receive, from a computing device, a device profile identifying a gaming application and metrics associated with execution of a gaming application. The server may compare the device profile with other device profiles associated with other computing devices, determine a similarity index of the device profile with the other device profiles, and select a subset of the other device profiles based at least in part on the similarity index. The server may determine configuration differences between the device profile of the computing device and individual device profiles of the subset of the other device profiles and send the configuration recommendations to the computing device. The recommendations may include at least one of (1) modifying settings of an operating system of the computing device, (2) modifying settings of the gaming application, (3) changing a hardware component or peripheral device associated with the computing device.
