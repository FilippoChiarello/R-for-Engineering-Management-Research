<title>
Using images from secondary microscope detectors to automatically generate labeled images from primary microscope detectors
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems for generating labeled images from a microscope detector by leveraging detector data from a different microscope detector of a different modality include applying a focused charged beam to a sample, using a first microscope detector to detect emissions resultant from the focused charged beam being incident on the sample, and then using detector data from the first microscope detector to automatically generate a first labeled image. Automatically generating the first labeled image includes determining composition information about portions of the sample based on the detector data, and then automatically labeling regions of the first image associated with the portions of the sample with corresponding composition information. A second image of the sample is generated using detector data from a second microscope detector system of a different modality, and then the first labeled image is used to automatically label regions of the second image with corresponding composition information.
