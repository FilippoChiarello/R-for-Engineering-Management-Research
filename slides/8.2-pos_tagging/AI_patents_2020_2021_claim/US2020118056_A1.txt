METHOD AND SYSTEM OF PROCESSING DATA
</title>

<abstract>
A data processing server can be accessible by customers and providers to process a transaction. The data processing server can provide an application programming interface that is accessible via a computing device of the customers and providers. The data processing server can be capable of receiving an order, matching the order with profiles of candidates/workers, and providing the results of the matching to the customers and/or matched candidates/workers. In particular, the order matching can be performed using a more accurate complex multi-dimensional matching method. Further, the data processing server can perform the matching against the profiles of candidates/workers of a plurality of staffing firms or other talent pool providers.

<claims>
1. A server comprising: a processor; a communication interface in communication with the processor, the communication interface being configured to communicate with computing devices to receive profiles stored on the computing devices; memory in communication with the processor, wherein the memory comprises computer application programs that are executable by the processor to perform a method of extending one of the profiles, the method comprising: receiving, by the server, the profiles from the computing devices; determining actions of a user associated with one of the profiles; deriving parameters of the user based on the determined actions; and extending the profile of the user based on the derived parameters.
2. The server of claim 1, wherein the actions comprise accepting, weakly rejecting, or strongly rejecting a job matched to the profile;
3. The server of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises analysing the derived parameters using a machine learning model.
4. The server of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises: determining input of a second user on the user associated with the profile; deriving parameters of the user based on the determined input; and extending the profile based on the parameters derived based on the determined input.
5. The server of claim 4, wherein the user is a candidate for a job or a worker for the job.
6. The server of claim 4, wherein the second user is a customer.
7. The server of claim 1, wherein the computing devices are associated with staffing firms.
8. The server of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises: determining whether there is a duplicate profile for each of the received profiles; and in response to determining there is a duplicate profile, time stamping and storing the duplicate profile.
9. A non-transitory computer readable medium comprising: computer application programs that are executable by a processor, the computer application programs comprising a method of extending a profile, wherein the processor executes the computer application programs to perform the method, the method comprising: receiving profiles from computing devices; determining actions of a user associated with one of the profiles; deriving parameters of the user based on the determined actions; and extending the profile of the user based on the derived parameters.
10. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 9, wherein the actions comprise accepting, weakly rejecting, or strongly rejecting a job matched to the profile;
11. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 10, wherein the method further comprises analysing the derived parameters using a machine learning model.
12. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 9, wherein the method further comprises: determining input of a second user on the user associated with the profile; deriving parameters of the user based on the determined input; and extending the profile based on the parameters derived based on the determined input.
13. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 12, wherein the user is a candidate for a job or a worker for the job.
14. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 12, wherein the second user is a customer.
15. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 9, wherein the computing devices are associated with staffing firms.
16. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 9, wherein the method further comprises: determining whether there is a duplicate profile for each of the received profiles; and in response to determining there is a duplicate profile, time stamping and storing the duplicate profile.
