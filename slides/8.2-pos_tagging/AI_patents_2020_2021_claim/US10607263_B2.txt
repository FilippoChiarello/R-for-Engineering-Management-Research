<title>
Computerized systems and methods for authenticating users on a network device via dynamically allocated authenticating state machines hosted on a computer network
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are systems and methods for improving interactions with and between computers in an authentication system supported by or configured with personal computing devices, servers and/or platforms. The systems interact to identify and retrieve data across platforms, which data can be used to improve the quality of data used in processing interactions between or among processors in such systems. The disclosed systems and methods provide advanced, computerized security features that dynamically, in real-time, determine parameters that must be entered in order for a user to login to a system or platform, as well as the quantity and order such parameters must be entered. The disclosed systems and methods involve computerized mechanisms for authenticating a user or device for which access to a web-based resource is desired. Requested credentials in accordance with the dynamically determined manner in which such credentials are automatically determined and requested must be appropriately entered.
