<title>
Systems and methods for identifying salient images
</title>

<abstract>
Image information defining an image may be accessed. The image may include one or more salient objects. A saliency map may be generated based on the image information. The saliency map may include one or more regions corresponding to the one or more salient objects. The one or more regions may be characterized by different levels of intensity than other regions of the saliency map. One or more salient regions around the one or more salient objects may be identified based on the saliency map. A saliency metric for the image may be generated based on one or more of (1) sizes of the one or more salient regions; (2) an amount of the one or more salient regions; and/or (3) histograms within the one or more salient regions.

<claims>
1. A system that identifies salient images, the system comprising: one of more physical processors configured by machine-readable instructions to: generate a saliency map for an image, the image including salient objects; identify salient regions around the salient objects based on the saliency map; and generate a saliency metric for the image based on (1) relative sizes of the salient regions; and (2) a number of the salient regions, wherein generation of the saliency metric for the image based on the relative sizes of the salient regions includes a comparison of the relative sizes of two biggest salient regions, and the number of the salient regions is compared with a threshold number.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the saliency map is generated using a single color space or multiple color spaces.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the saliency map is generated using connectivity of pixels within the image to a boundary of the image.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more physical processors are, to generate the saliency map, further configured by the machine-readable instruction to generate a distance map per a channel of one or more color spaces, the distance map characterized by a path cost function.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the saliency metric is generated further based on histograms within the salient regions indicating that a threshold percentage of pixels inside the salient regions is characterized by a high intensity or a low intensity, the high intensity including top 4 percent of an intensity range of the image and the low intensity including bottom 4 percent of the intensity range of the image.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the salient regions are identified by bounding boxes, the bounding boxes extracted using a flood-fill algorithm.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the flood-fill algorithm is started at a given pixel of the saliency map based on the given pixel having an intensity value meeting a threshold value.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the saliency metric for the image is generated further based on a linear classification of the image.
9. A method for identifying salient images, the method performed by a computing system including one or more processors, the method comprising: generating, by the computing system, a saliency map for an image, the image including salient objects; identifying, by the computing system, salient regions around the salient objects based on the saliency map; and generating, by the computing system, a saliency metric for the image based on (1) relative sizes of the salient regions; and (2) a number of the salient regions, wherein generating the saliency metric for the image based on the relative sizes of the salient regions includes a comparison of relative sizes of two biggest salient regions, and the number of the salient regions is compared with a threshold number.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the saliency map is generated using a single color space or multiple color spaces.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the saliency map is generated using connectivity of pixels within the image to a boundary of the image.
12. The method of claim 9, wherein generating the saliency map includes generating a distance map per a channel of one or more color spaces, the distance map characterized by a path cost function.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein the saliency metric is generated further based on histograms within the salient regions indicating that a threshold percentage of pixels inside the salient regions is characterized by a high intensity or a low intensity, the high intensity including top 4 percent of an intensity range of the image and the low intensity including bottom 4 percent of the intensity range of the image.
14. The method of claim 9, wherein the salient regions are identified by bounding boxes, the bounding boxes extracted using a flood-fill algorithm.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the flood-fill algorithm is started at a given pixel of the saliency map based on the given pixel having an intensity value meeting a threshold value.
16. The method of claim 9, wherein the saliency metric for the image is generated further based on a linear classification of the image.
