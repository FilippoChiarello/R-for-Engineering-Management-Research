Artificial intellegence prediction algorithm for generating an itemized statement of work and quote for home services based on two dimensional images, text, and audio
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for providing AI-based cost estimates for services are disclosed. The method may comprise receiving, at one or more processors, data from a scanning of a location, the scanning performed by one or more of a camera, a computer vision device, an inertial measurement unit, or a depth sensor. Data may be received, at one or more processors, related to the identification of one or more key elements at the location. An itemized statement and quote of work to be performed may be generated at one or more processors.
