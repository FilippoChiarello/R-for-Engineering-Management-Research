SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTONOMOUSLY MONITORING HIGHLY AUTOMATED VEHICLE OPERATIONS
</title>

<claims>
1. A method for monitoring operations of an autonomous vehicle, the method comprising: at a monitoring device, receiving sub-system data from one or more sub-systems of the autonomous vehicle; receiving contextual data of the vehicle, wherein the contextual data comprises data of one or more situational circumstances of the vehicle during operation; receiving control data from a control system of the vehicle; analyzing the sub-system data, the contextual data, and the control data to determine a control result; and providing an assessment to a management system of an overall control status of the vehicle.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising providing one or more suggestions to the management system to instruct a modification of one or more control operations of the vehicle.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising sending a display message to a display device for an operator of the vehicle, wherein the display message comprises information about the assessment and the suggestions to modify the control operations.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the vehicle is an autonomous flight vehicle.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein receiving the contextual data comprises receiving, as the contextual data, environmental data from sensors of the vehicle and external data of the operation of the vehicle.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the external data comprises incoming control commands for the vehicle, weather information, deviations of a planned path of the vehicle, and traffic.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein analyzing comprises analyzing the sub-system data, the contextual data, and the control data when the control result deviates from an expected control result.
8. A monitoring device for monitoring operations of an autonomous vehicle, comprising: an interface unit configured to receive information; a data storage device storing instructions associated with vehicle data systems; and a processor configured to execute the instructions to: receive sub-system data via the interface unit from one or more sub-systems of the autonomous vehicle; receive, via the interface unit, contextual data of the vehicle, wherein the contextual data comprises data of one or more situational circumstances of the vehicle during operation; receive, via the interface unit, control data from a control system of the vehicle; analyze the sub-system data, the contextual data, and the control data to determine a control result; and provide an assessment to a management system of the overall control status of the vehicle.
9. The monitoring device of claim 8, wherein the processor is further configured to execute the instructions to provide one or more suggestions to the management system to instruct a modification of one or more control operations of the vehicle.
10. The monitoring device of claim 9, wherein the processor is further configured to execute the instructions to send a display message to a display device for an operator of the vehicle, wherein the display message comprises information about the assessment and suggestions to modify the control operations.
11. The monitoring device of claim 8, wherein the processor is further configured to execute the instructions to receive as the contextual data environmental data from sensors of the vehicle and external data of the operation of the vehicle.
12. The monitoring device of claim 11, wherein the processor is further configured to execute instructions to receive the external data that comprises incoming control commands for the vehicle, weather information, deviations from a planned path of the vehicle, and traffic.
13. The monitoring device of claim 8, wherein the processor is further configured to execute the instructions to analyze the sub-system data, the contextual data, and the control data when the control result deviates from an expected control result.
14. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor of monitoring device, cause the processor to perform a method for monitoring operations of an autonomous vehicle, the method comprising steps to: receive sub-system data from one or more sub-systems of the autonomous vehicle; receive contextual data of the vehicle, wherein the contextual data comprises data of one or more situational circumstances of the vehicle during operation; receive control data from a control system of the vehicle; analyze the sub-system data, the contextual data, and the control data to determine a control result; and provide an assessment to a management system of the overall control status of the vehicle based on the analyzing.
15. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 14, further comprising instructions that cause the processor to provide one or more suggestions to the management system to instruct a modification one or more control operations of the vehicle.
