<title>
SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DISTRIBUTING A NEURAL NETWORK ACROSS MULTIPLE COMPUTING DEVICES
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein is a method for using a neural network across multiple devices. The method can include receiving, by a first device configured with a first one or more layers of a neural network, input data for processing via the neural network implemented across the first device and a second device. The method can include outputting, by the first one or more layers of the neural network implemented on the first device, a data set that is reduced in size relative to the input data while identifying one or more features of the input data for processing by a second one or more layers of the neural network. The method can include communicating, by the first device, the data set to the second device for processing via the second one or more layers of the neural network implemented on the second device.

<claims>
1. A method comprising:
receiving, by a first device configured with a first one or more layers of a neural network, input data for processing via the neural network implemented across the first device and a second device;
outputting, by the first one or more layers of the neural network implemented on the first device, a data set that is reduced in size relative to the input data while identifying one or more features of the input data for processing by a second one or more layers of the neural network; and
communicating, by the first device, the data set to the second device for processing via the second one or more layers of the neural network implemented on the second device.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising reducing, by the first one or more layers, the data set by compressing the data set for transmission via a network to the second device.
3. The method of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the second one or more layers detect a feature of the one or more features within the input data; optionally, the method further comprising receiving, by the first device, an indication from the second device that the feature was detected by the second one or more layers.
4. The method of any preceding claim, further comprising detecting, by the first device, that a feature of the one or more features meets a threshold of accuracy to take an action by the first device.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising performing, by the first device responsive to the detection, the action with respect to the feature; optionally, the method further comprising performing the action without communicating the data set to the second device.
6. A method comprising
receiving, by a processor of a wearable head display, input data captured by the wearable head display;
generating, by a first one or more layers of a neural network implemented on the processor, a data set that is reduced in size relative to the input data while identifying one or more features of the input data for processing by a second one or more layers of the neural network;
detecting, by the processor, a feature of the one or more features in the data set; and performing, by the processor responsive to detecting the feature, an action with respect to the feature instead of communicating the data set to a second device implementing the second one or more layers of the neural network.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising detecting, by the processor, the feature within a threshold of accuracy.
8. The method of claim 6 or claim 7, further comprising performing the action comprising modifying an image being displayed via the wearable head display.
9. The method of any one of claims 6 to 8, further comprising generating, by the first one or more layers implemented on the processor, a second data set that is reduced in size relative to a second input data while identifying a second one or more of features in the second input data.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprises determining, by the processor, that a second feature of the second one or more features is not detectable within a threshold of accuracy.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising communicating, by the processor responsive to the determination, the second data set to the second device implementing the second one or more layers of the neural network; optionally, the method further comprising receiving, by the processor, from the second device an indication of a result of processing of the second data set by the second one or more layers.
12. A system comprising:
a first device configured to receive input data for processing via a neural network implemented across the first device and a second device;
where a first one or more layers of the neural network implemented on the first device is configured to output a data set that is reduced in size relative to the input data while identifying one or more features of the input data for processing by a second one or more layers of the neural network; and
wherein the first device is configured to communicate the data set to the second device for processing via the second one or more layers of the neural network implemented on the second device.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the first one or more layers is further configured to reduce the data set by compressing the data set for transmission via a network to the second device.
14. The system of claim 12 or claim 13, wherein the second one or more layers is further configured to detect a feature of the one or more features within the input data; optionally, wherein the first device is further configured to receive an indication from the second device that the feature was detected by the second one or more layers.
15. The system of any one of claims 12 to 14, wherein the first device is further configured to detect that a feature of the one or more features meets a threshold of accuracy to take an action by the first device; optionally, wherein the first device is further configured to perform, responsive to the detection, the action with respect to the feature and without communicating the data set to the second device.
