<title>
Waste analysis system and method
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the present invention provide techniques for identifying and quantifying waste in a process. Waste information is input via images and/or natural language. The amount of waste is estimated based on information in images and/or a natural language description. A computer-implemented technique extracts metadata on waste products from the images and/or natural language description. A variety of factors such as social media trends, weather, traffic, and/or sports schedules are evaluated by the computer and used in predicting the amount of waste that will occur.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for identifying waste in a process, comprising: receiving an image of one or more discarded products from a camera; acquiring, from the received image, metadata relating to an amount of the one or more discarded products; obtaining an amount of used product; determining an overage amount of product as a function of the acquired metadata and a factor of the amount of used product; deriving a suggestion for waste reduction based on the determination; and generating a report comprising the suggestion for waste reduction.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the acquiring the metadata comprises: performing an object recognition process on the received image to identify the one or more discarded products within the image.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the performing the object recognition process on the received image comprises performing an edge detection process.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the performing the object recognition process further comprises performing a color analysis.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the performing the object recognition process further comprises using one or more image classifiers.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising analyzing the metadata with a rules engine.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving sales data for a predetermined time duration from a point of sale system; and wherein the determined overage amount is further based on the received sales data.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the generating the report further includes generating an indicator of potential waste.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising using a social media trend to derive the indicator of potential waste.
10. The method of claim 8, further comprising using a weather forecast or a traffic report to derive the indicator of potential waste.
11. The method of claim 8, further comprising using a sports team schedule to derive the indicator of potential waste.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the derived suggestion comprises a substitution suggestion.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the derived suggestion comprises a process change suggestion.
14. A computer system comprising: a processor; a memory coupled to the processor, the memory containing instructions, that when executed by the processor, perform the steps of: receiving an image of one or more discarded products from a camera; acquiring, from the received image, metadata relating to an amount of the one or more discarded products; obtaining an amount of used product; determining an overage amount of product as a function of the acquired metadata and a factor of the amount of used product; deriving a suggestion for waste reduction based on the determination; and generating a report comprising the suggestion for waste reduction.
15. The computer system of claim 14, wherein the acquiring the metadata comprises performing an object recognition process on the received image to identify the one or more discarded products within the image.
16. The computer system of claim 14, the memory further containing instructions that when executed by the processor, perform the step of receiving sales data for a predetermined time duration from a point of sale system; and wherein the determined overage amount is further based on the received sales data.
17. The computer system of claim 14, wherein the derived suggestion comprises a substitution suggestion or a process change suggestion.
18. A computer program product for identifying waste in a process, for an electronic computing device comprising a computer readable storage medium having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by a processor to cause the electronic device to: receive an image of one or more discarded products from a camera; acquire, from the received image, metadata relating to an amount of the one or more discarded products; obtain an amount of used product; determine an overage amount of product as a function of the acquired metadata and a factor of the amount of used product; derive a suggestion for waste reduction based on the determination; and generate a report comprising the suggestion for waste reduction.
19. The computer program product of claim 18, wherein the acquiring the metadata comprises performing an object recognition process on the received image to identify the one or more discarded products within the image.
20. The computer program product of claim 18, the memory further containing instructions, that when executed by the processor, perform the step of receiving sales data for a predetermined time duration from a point of sale system; and wherein the determined overage amount is further based on the received sales data.
