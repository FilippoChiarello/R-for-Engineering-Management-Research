<abstract>
Aspects determining anomalous events, wherein processors determine a trajectory of tracked movement of an object through an image field of a camera partitioned into a matrix grid of different local units. The aspects generate anomaly confidence decision values for image features extracted from video data of the tracked movement of the object as a function of fitting extracted image features to normal patterns of local motion pattern models defined by dominant distributions of extracted image features. The aspects further extract trajectory features from the video data relative to the trajectory of the tracked movement of the object, and generate global anomaly confidence decision values for the object trajectory as a function of fitting the extracted trajectory features to a normal learned motion trajectory model. The aspects determine anomalous events as a function of the generated global anomaly confidence decision value and the anomaly confidence decision values.
