METHOD AND DEVICE FOR MONITORING
</title>

<abstract>
A method for monitoring a primary variable is carried out in a device having access to a set of sensors (15, 16). The method comprises the steps of receiving (S30), from a network service (22), a series of forecasted values for the primary variable, each forecasted value being associated with one of a series of future time points; for at least one of the future time points, predicting (S33) a value for the primary variable using data of at least one secondary variable captured by a subset of the set of sensors (15, 16), comparing (S34) the predicted value to the forecasted value associated with the future time point, and switching (S38) to a different subset of the set of sensors (15, 16), if the predicted value deviates from the forecasted value with more than a specified threshold value.

<claims>
1. A method for monitoring a primary variable, the method being carried out in a device having access to a set of sensors (15, 16), comprising - receiving (S30), from a network service (22), a series of forecasted values for the primary variable, each forecasted value being associated with one of a series of future time points;
characterized by - for at least one of the future time points, predicting (S33) a value for the primary variable using data of at least one secondary variable captured by a subset of the set of sensors, comparing (S34) the predicted value to the forecasted value associated with the future time point, and switching (S38) to a different subset of the set of sensors, if the predicted value deviates from the forecasted value with more than a specified threshold value.
2. A method according to claim 1, wherein the predicting (S33) and the comparing (S34) are repeated for a subsequent future time point using the same subset of the set of sensors (15, 16), if the predicted value deviates from the forecasted value with less than the specified threshold value.
3. A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein a predetermined number of subsets of the set of sensors are ordered in a predetermined order and wherein switching (S38) to a different subset of the set of sensors comprises switching (S38) to the next subset according to the predetermined order.
4. A method according to claim 3, wherein the predetermined order is based on prediction confidence.
5. A method according to claim 3 or 4, wherein the predetermined order is based on power conservation.
6. A method according to claim 3 or 4, wherein the predetermined order is based on power consumption.
7. A method according to any one of claims 3-6, wherein the predetermined order is received from the network service (22).
8. A method according to any one of the preceding claims, comprising reporting (S39) to the network service, if a specified number of subsets of the set of sensors (15, 16) has been used.
9. A method according to any one of the preceding items, comprising reporting (24) to the network service (22) if the difference between the predicted value and the forecasted value exceeds a predetermined reporting threshold value.
10. A method according to claim 8 or 9, comprising receiving (25), in response to the reporting, an updated series of forecasted values for the primary variable.
11. A method according to claim 8 9 or 10, wherein at least one subset of sensors (15, 16) comprises a sensor for measuring the primary variable, and reporting (24; S39) comprises reporting a current value of the primary variable to the network service (22).
12. A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein receiving comprises receiving (23) a series of threshold values.
13. A method according to any one of the preceding claims, comprising receiving (23), from the network service, a prediction model, and using the prediction model for predicting the value of the primary variable using data of at least one secondary variable captured by a subset of the set of sensors (15, 16).
14. A device for monitoring a primary variable, comprising a processor (11) and a communication interface (13), the device having access to a set of sensors (15, 16), wherein the communication interface (13) is configured to receive, from a network service (22), a series of forecasted values for the primary variable, each forecasted value being associated with one of a series of future time points; characterized in that the processor (11) is configured to, for at least one of the future time points, predict (S33) a value for the primary variable using data of at least one secondary variable captured by a subset of the set of sensors, compare (S34) the predicted value to the forecasted value associated with the future time point, and switch (S38) to a different subset of the set of sensors, if the predicted value deviates from the forecasted value with more than a specified threshold value..
15. Computer-readable storage medium, comprising instructions which, when executed by a computer, cause the computer to carry out the method of any one of claims 1-13.
