<title>
Data processing systems for processing data subject access requests
</title>

<abstract>
In various embodiments, an organization may be required to comply with one or more legal or industry requirements related to the storage of personal data (e.g., which may, for example, include personally identifiable information) even when responding to and fulfilling Data Subject Access Requests. In particular, when responding to a DSAR, the system may compile one or more pieces of personal data for provision to a data subject. The system may store this compilation of personal data at least temporarily in order to provide access to the data to the data subject. As such, the system may be configured to implement one or more data retention rules in order to ensure compliance with any legal or industry requirements related to the temporary storage of the collected data while still fulfilling any requirements related to providing the data to data subjects that request it, deleting the data upon request, etc.

5. The computer-implemented data processing method of claim 1, wherein: the generated report comprises a compilation of the one or more pieces of personal data.
6. The computer-implemented data processing method of claim 5, the method further comprising: determining that a particular data retention rule of the one or more data retention rules has been met; and in response to determining that particular data retention rule of the one or more data retention rules has been met, automatically archiving the generated report and storing metadata indicating at least one piece of data selected from the group consisting of: a type of each of the one or more pieces of personal data included in the generated report; and the particular data retention rule of the one or more data retention rules that triggered archiving the generated report.
7. The computer-implemented data processing method of claim 5, the method further comprising: determining that the particular time period has expired without the data subject accessing the generated report; and in response to determining that the particular time period has expired without the data subject accessing the generated report, automatically archiving the generated report and storing metadata indicating that the data subject did not access the generated report prior to the expiration of the time period.
8. The computer-implemented data processing method of claim 1, wherein at least temporarily storing the generated report based at least in part on the one or more data retention rules comprises: determining a location of the data subject; identifying a suitable storage location based at least in part on the location; and at least temporarily storing the generated report at the suitable storage location.
9. The computer-implemented data processing method of claim 8, wherein determining the location of the data subject comprises determining the location of the request based at least in part on an IP address of the request from the data subject to generate the report.
10. A computer-implemented data processing method for processing a data subject access request within a data system in order to fulfill the data subject access request, the method comprising: receiving, by one or more processors, from a data subject, a data subject access request; processing the data subject access request by identifying, by one or more processors, one or more pieces of personal data associated with the data subject, wherein identifying the one or more pieces of personal data associated with the data subject comprises scanning one or more data inventories stored within a data system for the one or more pieces of personal data; receiving, by one or more processors, one or more data retention rules, the one or more data retention rules comprising at least a first rule to archive the one or more pieces of personal data in response to an expiration of a particular time period; in response to identifying the one or more pieces of personal data, at least temporarily providing access, by one or more processors, to the one or more pieces of personal data by the data subject based at least in part on the one or more data retention rules; determining that the particular time period has expired; determining that the particular data retention rule of the one or more data retention rules have been met in response to determining that the particular time period has expired; determining, by one or more processors, that a particular data retention rule of the one or more data retention rules have been met; in response to determining that the particular data retention rule of the one or more data retention rules have been met, automatically archiving the one or more pieces of personal data; and in response to archiving the one or more pieces of personal data, digitally storing metadata associated with a completion of the data subject access request.
