<title>
Personalized support routing based on paralinguistic information
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments presented herein provide techniques for inferring the current emotional state of a user based on paralinguistic features derived from audio input from that user. If the emotional state meets triggering conditions, the system provides the user with a prompt which allows the user to connect with a support agent. If the user accepts, the system selects a support agent for the user based on the predicted emotional state and on attributes of the support agent found in an agent profile. The system can also determine a priority level for the user based on the score and based on a profile of the user and determine where to place the user in a queue for the support agent.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method, comprising: receiving a set of audio recordings and corresponding score labels measuring emotional states; extracting a set of paralinguistic features from each audio recording of the set of audio recordings; generating a set of training instances, wherein each training instance of the set of training instances is based on an audio recording of the set of audio recordings; identifying a subset of non-redundant paralinguistic features correlated to the score labels; training a predictive model, based on the subset of non-redundant paralinguistic features, to predict a target variable; and generating the trained predictive model.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the training instance comprises: the set of paralinguistic features extracted from a corresponding audio recording, and the score label of the corresponding audio recording.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the score label represents a value of the target variable that the predictive model is trained to predict.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the target variable is a score measuring an emotional state.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, the identification of the subset of non-redundant paralinguistic features further comprises applying a feature-selection technique.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the trained predictive model is stored in a format accessible for support routing.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the predictive model is a neural network that iteratively adjusts weights within layers of network nodes based on an error term defined by a backpropagation technique.
8. A system, comprising: a processor; and a memory storing instructions, which when executed by the processor perform a method comprising: receiving a set of audio recordings and corresponding score labels measuring emotional states; extracting a set of paralinguistic features from each audio recording of the set of audio recordings; generating a set of training instances, wherein each training instance of the set of training instances is based on an audio recording of the set of audio recordings; identifying a subset of non-redundant paralinguistic features correlated to the score labels; training a predictive model, based on the subset of non-redundant paralinguistic features, to predict a target variable; and generating the trained predictive model.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the training instance comprises: the set of paralinguistic features extracted from a corresponding audio recording, and the score label of the corresponding audio recording.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the score label represents a value of the target variable that the predictive model is trained to predict.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the target variable is a score measuring an emotional state.
12. The system of claim 8, the identification of the subset of non-redundant paralinguistic features further comprises applying a feature-selection technique.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the trained predictive model is stored in a format accessible for support routing.

A non-transitory computer readable storage medium comprising instructions, which when executed by a processor of a computing device, cause the computing device to perform a method for generating a predictive model, the method comprising: receiving a set of audio recordings and corresponding score labels measuring emotional states; extracting a set of paralinguistic features from each audio recording of the set of audio recordings; generating a set of training instances, wherein each training instance of the set of training instances is based on an audio recording of the set of audio recordings; identifying a subset of non-redundant paralinguistic features correlated to the score labels; training a predictive model, based on the subset of non-redundant paralinguistic features, to predict a target variable; and generating the trained predictive model.
16. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the training instance comprises: the set of paralinguistic features extracted from a corresponding audio recording, and the score label of the corresponding audio recording.
17. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the score label represents a value of the target variable that the predictive model is trained to predict.
18. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the target variable is a score measuring an emotional state.
