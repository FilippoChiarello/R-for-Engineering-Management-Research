<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to a communication method and system for converging a 5<sup>th</sup>-Generation (5G) communication system for supporting higher data rates beyond a 4<sup>th</sup>-Generation (4G) system with a technology for Internet of Things (IoT). The present disclosure may be applied to intelligent services based on the 5G communication technology and the IoT-related technology, such as smart home, smart building, smart city, smart car, connected car, health care, digital education, smart retail, security and safety services.A method for a channel state information (CSI) feedback. The method comprises receiving CSI feedback configuration information for the CSI feedback including a spatial channel information indicator based on a linear combination (LC) codebook, wherein the spatial channel information comprises at least one of a downlink channel matrix, a covariance matrix of the downlink channel matrix, or at least one eigenvector of the covariance matrix of the downlink channel matrix; deriving the spatial channel information indicator using the LC codebook that indicates a weighted linear combination of a plurality of basis vectors or a plurality of basis matrices as a representation of at least one of a downlink channel matrix, a covariance matrix of the downlink channel matrix, or at least one eigenvector of the covariance matrix of the downlink channel matrix; and transmitting over an uplink channel, the CSI feedback including the spatial channel information indicator.
