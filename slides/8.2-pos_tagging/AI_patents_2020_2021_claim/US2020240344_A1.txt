<title>
METHOD FOR THE MODEL-BASED CONTROL AND REGULATION OF AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE
</title>

<abstract>
A method for controlling and regulating an internal combustion engine with exhaust gas recirculation, in which an EGR rate is determined by a Kaiman filter from calculated and measured variables of the gas path and from calculated and measured variables of combustion. A method for the model-based control and regulation of an internal combustion engine includes calculating injection system set values for controlling the injection system actuators as a function of a set torque by a combustion model. Gas path set values for controlling the gas path actuators are calculated as a function of an EGR rate by a gas path model. A measure of quality is calculated by an optimizer as a function of the injection system and gas path set values. The measure of quality is minimized by the optimizer by changing the injection system and gas path set values within a prediction horizon. The injection system and gas path set values are set by the optimizer as definitive for adjusting the operating point of the engine by using the minimized measure of quality.
