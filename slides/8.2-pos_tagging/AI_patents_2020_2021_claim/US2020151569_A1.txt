<title>
WARPING SEQUENCE DATA FOR LEARNING IN NEURAL NETWORKS
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems for classification of sequence data include warping training sequence data according to a warping pattern. A neural network is trained using the warped training sequence data. Input sequence data is warped according to the warping pattern. The warped input sequence data is classified using the trained neural network.
