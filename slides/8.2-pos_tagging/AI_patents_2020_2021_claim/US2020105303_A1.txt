SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR AUTOMATED MUSIC REARRANGEMENT
</title>

<abstract>
A method and apparatus of a device that builds a target using a plurality of processing units is described. In an exemplary embodiment, the device receives an input audio track having a first duration, the input audio track having a plurality of points. The device further generates a transition matrix of the input audio track, wherein the transition matrix indicates a similarity metric between different pairs of the plurality of points. In addition, the device determines a set of jump points using the different pairs of the plurality of points. The device additionally generates the rearranged audio track using the set of jump points, wherein the rearranged audio track has second duration and the second duration is different than the first duration.

<claims>
1. A machine-readable medium having executable instructions to cause one or more processing units to perform a method to rearrange an input audio track into a rearranged audio track, the method comprising: receiving an input audio track having a first duration, the input audio track having a plurality of points; generating a transition matrix of the input audio track, wherein the transition matrix indicates a similarity metric between different pairs of the plurality of points; determining a set of jump points using the different pairs of the plurality of points; and generating the rearranged audio track using the set of jump points, wherein the rearranged audio track has second duration and the second duration is different than the first duration.
2. The machine readable medium of claim 1, wherein the rearranged audio track is a set of non-contiguous audio subsets coupled via the set of jump points.
3. The machine readable medium of claim 1, wherein a jump point is a jump from one point in the input audio track to another point in the audio track.
4. The machine-readable medium of claim 3, wherein is a point is selected from the group consisting of a beat, a bar, a segment, and a section.
5. The machine readable medium of claim 1, further comprising: computing the transition matrix.
6. The machine readable medium of claim 1, wherein computing the transition matrix comprises: decomposing the input audio track into a percussive track and a harmonic track; and chunking the percussive track and a harmonic track into input features via the computation of a perceptual Mel power spectrograms and perceptual CQT power spectrograms that captures different audio.
7. The machine readable medium of claim 6, wherein the features include transients, timber, and pitches.
8. The machine readable medium of claim 6, further comprising: computing the transition matrix using the computed features using machine learning.
9. The machine readable medium of claim 1, further comprising: determining a starting point for the rearranged audio track.
10. The machine readable medium of claim 9, wherein the starting point is after the starting point of the input audio track.
11. The machine readable medium of claim 1, further comprising: determining an ending point for the rearranged audio track.
12. The machine readable medium of claim 1, further comprising: generating a set of video cues for the rearranged audio track.
13. A method to rearrange an input audio track into a rearranged audio track, the method comprising: receiving an input audio track having a first duration, the input audio track having a plurality of points; generating a transition matrix of the input audio track, wherein the transition matrix indicates a similarity metric between different pairs of the plurality of points; determining a set of jump points using the different pairs of the plurality of points; and generating the rearranged audio track using the set of jump points, wherein the rearranged audio track has second duration and the second duration is different than the first duration.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the rearranged audio track is a set of non-contiguous audio subsets coupled via the set of jump points.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein a jump point is a jump from one point in the input audio track to another point in the audio track.
16. The method of claim 13, wherein is a point is selected from the group consisting of a beat, a bar, a segment, and a section.
17. The method of claim 13, further comprising: computing the transition matrix.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein computing the transition matrix comprises: decomposing the input audio track into a percussive track and a harmonic track; and chunking the percussive track and a harmonic track into input features via the computation of a perceptual Mel power spectrograms and perceptual CQT power spectrograms that captures different audio.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the features include transients, timber, and pitches.
20. The method of claim 19, further comprising: computing the transition matrix using the computed features using machine learning.
21. The method of claim 13, further comprising: determining a starting point for the rearranged audio track.
22. The method of claim 21, wherein the starting point is after the starting point of the input audio track.
23. A device that rearranges an input audio track into a rearranged audio track, the method comprising: at least one processing unit; memory coupled to the at least one processing unit; and a process executed from the memory by the processing unit that causes the processor to receive an input audio track having a first duration, the input audio track having a plurality of points, generate a transition matrix of the input audio track, wherein the transition matrix indicates a similarity metric between different pairs of the plurality of points, determine a set of jump points using the different pairs of the plurality of points, and generate the rearranged audio track using the set of jump points, wherein the rearranged audio track has second duration and the second duration is different than the first duration.
