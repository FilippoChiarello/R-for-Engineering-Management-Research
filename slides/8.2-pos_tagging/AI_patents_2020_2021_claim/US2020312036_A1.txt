DYNAMIC DIGITAL REPLICAS OF PRODUCTION FACILITIES
</title>

<abstract>
In some examples, a method comprises receiving, by a computer system, data from a plurality of equipment of a production facility; displaying, on a display unit of the computer system, a dynamic digital replica of the production facility, wherein accessing a digital replica of one of the plurality of equipment via the dynamic digital replica displays data for the one of the plurality of equipment of the production facility; analyzing the data for the one of the plurality of equipment; and generating, based on the analysis, a report on a health of the one of the plurality of equipment.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving, by a computer system, data from a plurality of equipment of a production facility; displaying, on a display unit of the computer system, a dynamic digital replica of the production facility, wherein accessing a digital replica of one of the plurality of equipment via the dynamic digital replica displays data for the one of the plurality of equipment of the production facility; analyzing the data for the one of the plurality of equipment; and generating, based on the analysis, a report on a health of the one of the plurality of equipment.
2. The method of claim 1 comprising displaying, on the display unit of the computer system, a real-time weather view and a real-time view of locations of vessels overlaid upon the dynamic digital replica of the production facility.
3. The method of claim 1 comprising performing a digital walkthrough of the production facility by accessing the digital replica of one of the plurality of equipment via the dynamic digital replica.
4. The method of claim 3 comprising displaying, on the display unit, a dynamic digital replica of the digital walkthrough.
5. The method of claim 1 comprising analyzing the data for the one of the plurality of equipment by digitally manipulating the one of the plurality of equipment and analyzing the effect the manipulation has on the production facility.
6. The method of claim 5 comprising predicting, based on the analysis, a failure of the one of the plurality of equipment and generating a notification.
7. The method of claim 1 comprising predicting, based on the analysis, a failure of the one of the plurality of equipment and generating a notification.
8. A system comprising: a display unit; a storage device comprising machine-readable instructions; and a processor coupled to the display unit and the storage device, wherein execution of the machine-readable instructions causes the processor to: cause the display unit to display a dynamic digital replica of a production facility comprising a plurality of equipment; receive data on the plurality of equipment from multiple data sources; analyze the data; and based on the analysis, notify when an issue with one of the plurality of equipment is detected.
9. The system of claim 8 wherein multiple data sources comprises sensors on the plurality of equipment.
10. The system of claim 8 wherein the plurality of equipment comprises digital tags.
11. The system of claim 10 wherein execution of the machine-readable instructions causes the processor to aggregate the data utilizing the digital tags.
12. The system of claim 11 wherein execution of the machine-readable instructions causes the processor to identify discrepancies in the data utilizing the digital tags.
13. A computer-readable medium storing executable code which, when executed by a processor, causes the processor to: display, on a display unit coupled to the processor, a dynamic digital replica of a production facility comprising a plurality of equipment, wherein the dynamic digital replica is configured to integrate multiple data sources providing a plurality of details related to the equipment; analyze the multiple data sources; and based on the analysis, notify when an issue with one of the plurality of equipment is detected.
14. The computer-readable medium of claim 1, when executed by the processor, causes the processor to adapt the dynamic digital replica over a life cycle of the production facility.
15. The computer-readable medium of claim 1, wherein the dynamic digital replica is configured to display real-time operation metrics of the equipment.
16. The computer-readable medium of claim 1, wherein the dynamic digital replica is configured to isolate a component of one of the plurality of the equipment and access relevant information related to the component through one or more of the multiple data sources.
17. The computer-readable medium of claim 1, wherein the dynamic digital replica is configured to be viewed from a plurality of different perspectives.
18. The computer-readable medium of claim 1, wherein the dynamic digital replica is configured to provide live process data relating to the equipment.
19. The computer-readable medium of claim 1, wherein the dynamic digital replica is configured to be viewed using a mixed-reality headset.
20. The computer-readable medium of claim 1, wherein the dynamic digital replica is configured to be viewed as a life-like structure having a life cycle comprising views of the digital replica in the past, present, future, or some combination thereof.
