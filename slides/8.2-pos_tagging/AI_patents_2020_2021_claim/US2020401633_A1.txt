AUTOMATIC FALSE POSITIVE ESTIMATION FOR WEBSITE MATCHING
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for generating automatic false positive estimations for website matching is described. Several sets of assets and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are aggregated. Each of the several sets of assets is searched across webpage content corresponding to the several URLs to determine matches between the sets of assets and webpage content. One or more false positive estimations is determined, where each of the one or more false positive estimations corresponds to the one or more matches. A combined score is generated based on the one or more false positive estimations.

<claims>
1. A system for performing an automatic false positive estimation for website matching comprising: a non-transitory memory storing instructions; and one or more hardware processors coupled to the non-transitory memory and configured to read the instructions from the non-transitory memory to cause the system to perform operations comprising: aggregating a plurality of sets of assets and a plurality of uniform resource locators (URLs); search each of the plurality of sets of assets across webpage content corresponding to the plurality of URLs determine one or more matches between the plurality of sets of assets and the webpage content; determine one or more false positive estimations, each of the one or more false positive estimations corresponding to the one or more matches; and generating a combined score based on the one or more false positive estimations.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein each set of the plurality of sets of assets and each of the plurality of URLs correspond to one of a plurality of unique customers.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein a URL is determined to be a match to one of the plurality of unique customers when the generated combined score exceeds a predetermined threshold.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the operations further comprise crawling, in response to determining that the URL matches the one of the plurality of unique customers, webpages corresponding to the URL to extract information associated with the one of the plurality of unique customers.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein each set of the plurality of sets of assets comprises at least one of a name, a phone number, an address, and an email address.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more matches are determined in a fuzzy manner.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein a Levenshtein distance is used to determine the one or more matches in the fuzzy manner.
8. A method for performing an automatic false positive estimation for website matching comprising: aggregating a plurality of sets of assets and a plurality of URLs; search each of the plurality of sets of assets across webpage content corresponding to the plurality of URLs determine one or more matches between the plurality of sets of assets and the webpage content; determine one or more false positive estimations, each of the one or more false positive estimations corresponding to the one or more matches; and generating a combined score based on the one or more false positive estimations.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein each set of the plurality of sets of assets and each of the plurality of URLs correspond to one of a plurality of unique customers.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein a URL is determined to be a match to one of the plurality of unique customers when the generated combined score exceeds a predetermined threshold.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising crawling, in response to determining that the URL matches the one of the plurality of unique customers, webpages corresponding to the URL to extract information associated with the one of the plurality of unique customers.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein each set of the plurality of sets of assets comprises at least one of a name, a phone number, an address, and an email address.
13. The method of claim 8, wherein the one or more matches are determined in a fuzzy manner.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein a Levenshtein distance is used to determine the one or more matches in the fuzzy manner.
15. A non-transitory machine-readable medium having stored thereon machine-readable instructions executable to cause performance of operations comprising: aggregating a plurality of sets of assets and a plurality of URLs; search each of the plurality of sets of assets across webpage content corresponding to the plurality of URLs determine one or more matches between the plurality of sets of assets and the webpage content; determine one or more false positive estimations, each of the one or more false positive estimations corresponding to the one or more matches; and generating a combined score based on the one or more false positive estimations.
16. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 15, wherein each set of the plurality of sets of assets and each of the plurality of URLs correspond to one of a plurality of unique customers.
17. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 16, wherein a URL is determined to be a match to one of the plurality of unique customers when the generated combined score exceeds a predetermined threshold.
18. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 17, wherein the operations further comprise crawling, in response to determining that the URL matches the one of the plurality of unique customers, webpages corresponding to the URL to extract information associated with the one of the plurality of unique customers.
19. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 15, wherein each set of the plurality of sets of assets comprises at least one of a name, a phone number, an address, and an email address.
20. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the one or more matches are determined in a fuzzy manner, and wherein a Levenshtein distance is used to determine the one or more matches in the fuzzy manner.
