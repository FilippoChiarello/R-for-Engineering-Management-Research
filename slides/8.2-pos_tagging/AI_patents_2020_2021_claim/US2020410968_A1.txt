METHOD OF COMBINING AUDIO SIGNALS
</title>

<abstract>
A method for automatically generating an audio signal, the method comprising receiving a source audio signal analyzing the source audio signal to identify a musical parameter characteristic thereof obtaining a supplemental audio signal based on the identified musical parameter characteristic and combining the source audio signal and the supplemental audio signal to form an extended audio signal.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for automatically generating an audio signal, the method comprising: receiving a source audio signal; analyzing the source audio signal to identify a musical characteristic thereof; obtaining a supplemental audio signal based on the identified musical characteristic; and combining the source audio signal and the supplemental audio signal to form an extended audio signal.
2. A method according to claim 1 wherein obtaining a supplemental audio signal comprises obtaining a musical element, obtaining a vocal element and combining the musical and vocal elements.
3. A method according to claim 1 wherein obtaining a supplemental audio signal comprises selecting a musical element from a database of pre-recorded musical elements on the basis of the identified musical characteristic.
4. A method according to claim 1 wherein obtaining a supplemental audio signal comprises selecting one or more musical elements from a database of pre-recorded musical elements on the basis of the identified musical characteristic, modifying the selected plurality of musical elements to form a plurality of modified musical elements and selecting one of the modified musical elements as the supplemental audio signal.
5. A method according to claim 1 wherein obtaining a supplemental audio signal comprises generating a musical element using a synthesizer based on the musical characteristic.
6. A method according to claim 5 wherein generating the musical element comprises at least one of: playing a root chord of the source audio signal using a sampled instrument; generating a beat using a sampler or synthesizer based on a rhythm of the source audio signal; adding a synthesized or sampled bass instrument to a transcribed melody; generating a varying chord progression; and generating a varying rhythmic element.
7. A method according to claim 6 wherein the sampled instrument is a predetermined instrument or an instrumented selected to be similar to an instrument of the source audio signal.
8. A method according to claim 1 wherein obtaining a supplemental audio signal comprises selecting a section of the source audio signal that has no vocal element.
9. A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the source audio signal comprises a preceding audio signal and a succeeding audio signal and combining comprises inserting the supplemental audio signal between the preceding audio signal and the succeeding audio signal.
10. A method according to claim 9 wherein analyzing comprises analyzing both the preceding audio signal and the succeeding audio signal to obtain respective musical characteristic and the obtaining is based on the musical characteristics obtained from each of the preceding audio signal and the succeeding audio signal.
11. A method according to claim 10 wherein the obtained supplemental audio signal is a transitional audio signal that has a musical characteristic that transitions between the musical parameters obtained from each of the preceding audio signal and the succeeding audio signal.
12. A method according to 1 wherein combining comprises dividing the source audio signal into two sections and inserting the supplemental audio signal between the two sections.
13. A method according to claim 1 wherein obtaining the supplemental audio signal comprises using a text-to-speech synthesizer to generate a vocal element from a text element.
14. A method according to claim 13 wherein the text message is a notification generated by an application or an operating system of a computing device.
15. A method according to claim 1 wherein the musical characteristic is selected from the group consisting of mood, intensity, genre, key, melody, tempo, metadata and/or sentiment of any lyrics.
16. A method according to claim 1 wherein obtaining the supplemental audio signal is further dependent on context information relating to a user.
17. A method according to claim 16 wherein the context information is selected from the group consisting of: the location of the user; an activity being performed by the user, weather in the vicinity of the user; an emotional state of the user; an entry in an electronic calendar related to the user; an action performed by the user on a playback device.
18. A computer program comprising code means that, when executed by a computer system, instructs the computer system to perform a method according to claim 1.
19. A computer system comprising one or more processors and memory, the memory storing a program according to claim 18.
20. A client device comprising a processor, a communication interface and memory, the memory storing a program comprising code means for: storing user preferences; communicating context information to a server; receiving an audio signal generated according to claim 1 from the server; and playing the audio signal.
