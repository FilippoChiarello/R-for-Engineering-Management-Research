METHODS FOR EXTRACTING SKELETON LINES IN INTERSECTION-INTENSIVE AREAS
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention discloses a method for extracting a skeleton line in an intersection-intensive area, comprising following steps: S1: establishing a constrained Delaunay triangulation network for a polygon, encrypting a long side of the polygon, and updating the constrained Delaunay triangulation network; S2: extracting a skeleton line of the polygon based on the updated constrained Delaunay triangulation network; S3: identifying an intersection-intensive area based on the extracted skeleton line; and S4: adjusting and optimizing the skeleton line for the identified intersection-intensive area. The present invention has the following advantages: with the use of this method, the overall features of the original area can be maintained after the extraction of the skeleton line, and both the natural extensibility and the human visual requirements can be satisfied; this method is free from the interference from the boundary with complex branches and the arrangement structure during the extraction of the skeleton line, and can handle the jitter on the skeleton line in this area; the extracted skeleton line will not have great distortion and the overall structure of this area will not be lost.
