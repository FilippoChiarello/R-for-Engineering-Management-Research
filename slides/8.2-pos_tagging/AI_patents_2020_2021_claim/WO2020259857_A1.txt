DYNAMIC COLLABORATION AMONG COGNITIVE AGENTS MANAGING RADIO ACCESS NETWORKS
</title>

<abstract>
A Cognitive Manager (CM) controls a RAN. The CM obtains from the RAN a set of local needs identifying a radio communication performance criterion that is to be satisfied. A set of neighbor needs are obtained from a neighbor CM. An event message is received from the RAN containing a radio metric that does not presently satisfy at least one of the set of local needs. A set of present neighbor improvement action drives being performed or will be performed to satisfy the set of neighbor needs, are obtained from the neighbor CM. A combination of the set of local needs, the set of the neighbor needs, the set of present neighbor improvement action drives, and the radio metric, is used to determine a local improvement action drive that is to be performed by the RAN. An adjustment report identifying the local improvement action drive is provided to the RAN.
