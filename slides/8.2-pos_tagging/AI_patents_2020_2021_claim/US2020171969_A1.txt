COIL ASSOCIATION IN MULTISITE STATIONARY WIRELESS POWER TRANSFER (WPT) & (QUASI-)DYNAMIC WPT DEPLOYMENTS
</title>

<abstract>
In one embodiment, a device associates a charging coil with a coil identifier. The device sends the coil identifier to a communication module of the charging coil. The communication module of the charging coil forwards the coil identifier to an electric vehicle located above the charging coil. The device receives the coil identifier from the electric vehicle. The device associates the electric vehicle with the charging coil.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: associating, by a device, a charging coil with a coil identifier; sending, by the device, the coil identifier to a communication module of the charging coil, wherein the communication module of the charging coil forwards the coil identifier to an electric vehicle located above the charging coil; receiving, at the device, the coil identifier from the electric vehicle; and associating, by the device, the electric vehicle with the charging coil.
2. The method as in claim 1, wherein the communication module of the charging coil forwards the identifier to the electric vehicle via a charging coil of the vehicle as a powerline communication (PLC) message.
3. The method as in claim 1, wherein the communication module of the charging coil forwards the identifier to a communication module of the vehicle as a visible light or infrared (IR) message.
4. The method as in claim 1, wherein the communication module of the charging coil forwards the identifier to a communication module of the vehicle as an ultrasonic message.
5. The method as in claim 1, further comprising: receiving, at the device, a profile identifier from the electric vehicle; and controlling, by the device, the charging coil associated with the electric vehicle to provide charge to the electric vehicle based on the profile identifier.
6. The method as in claim 5, further comprising: using the profile identifier to select coil charging parameters for the electric vehicle, wherein the device controls the charging coil according to the selected coil charging parameters.
7. The method as in claim 1, wherein the charging coil is embedded into a parking lot or drive-thru.
8. The method as in claim 1, wherein the device comprises a roadside unit (RSU).
9. The method as in claim 1, wherein the charging coil is one of a plurality of charging coils controlled by the device, each charging coil in the plurality having its own communication module.
10. The method as in claim 1, wherein the device receives the coil identifier from the electric vehicle wirelessly.
11. An apparatus, comprising: one or more network interfaces to communicate with a network; a processor coupled to the network interfaces and configured to execute one or more processes; and a memory configured to store a process executable by the processor, the process when executed configured to: associate a charging coil with a coil identifier; send the coil identifier to a communication module of the charging coil, wherein the communication module of the charging coil forwards the coil identifier to an electric vehicle located above the charging coil; receive the coil identifier from the electric vehicle; and associate the electric vehicle with the charging coil.
12. The apparatus as in claim 11, wherein the communication module of the charging coil forwards the identifier to the electric vehicle via a charging coil of the vehicle as a powerline communication (PLC) message.
13. The apparatus as in claim 11, wherein the communication module of the charging coil forwards the identifier to a communication module of the vehicle as a visible light or infrared (IR) message.
14. The apparatus as in claim 11, wherein the communication module of the charging coil forwards the identifier to a communication module of the vehicle as an ultrasonic message.
15. The apparatus as in claim 11, wherein the process when executed is further configured to: receive a profile identifier from the electric vehicle; and control the charging coil associated with the electric vehicle to provide charge to the electric vehicle based on the profile identifier.
16. The apparatus as in claim 15, wherein the process when executed is further configured to: use the profile identifier to select coil charging parameters for the electric vehicle, wherein the device controls the charging coil according to the selected coil charging parameters.
17. The apparatus as in claim 11, wherein the apparatus comprises a roadside unit (RSU).
18. The apparatus as in claim 11, wherein the charging coil is one of a plurality of charging coils controlled by the device, each charging coil in the plurality having its own communication module.
19. The apparatus as in claim 11, wherein the device receives the coil identifier from the electric vehicle wirelessly.
20. A tangible, non-transitory, computer-readable medium storing program instructions that cause a device to execute a process comprising: associating, by the device, a charging coil with a coil identifier; sending, by the device, the coil identifier to a communication module of the charging coil, wherein the communication module of the charging coil forwards the coil identifier to an electric vehicle located above the charging coil; receiving, at the device, the coil identifier from the electric vehicle; and associating, by the device, the electric vehicle with the charging coil.
