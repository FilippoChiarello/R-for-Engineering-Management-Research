METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DETECTING HOLDING IN IMAGES
</title>

<abstract>
A method for detecting a holding in images, comprising: receiving a sequence of initial images representing at least partially an entity; for each initial image, determining a respective region of interest around a predefined anatomical region of the character, thereby obtaining a sequence of regions of interest; extracting latent spatial features from each respective region of interest, thereby obtaining a sequence of latent spatial features for each region of interest, the latent spatial features being indicative of the holding; generating a set of spatiotemporal features from the sequences of latent spatial features, the set of spatiotemporal features representing a sequence of visual states; determining from the set of spatiotemporal features whether the region of interest comprises the holding; and outputting an indication as to whether the holding is associated with the region of interest.

I/WE CLAIM:
1. A computer-implemented method for detecting a holding in images, comprising: receiving a sequence of initial images representing at least partially an entity; for each initial image, determining a respective region of interest around a predefined anatomical region of the character, thereby obtaining a sequence of regions of interest; extracting latent spatial features from each respective region of interest, thereby obtaining a sequence of latent spatial features for each region of interest, the latent spatial features being indicative of the holding; generating a set of spatiotemporal features from the sequences of latent spatial features, the set of spatiotemporal features representing a sequence of visual states; determining from the set of spatiotemporal features whether the region of interest comprises the holding; and outputting an indication as to whether the holding is associated with the region of interest.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein said determining a respective region of interest around a predefined anatomical region of the character comprises for each initial image, identifying an anatomical region of the character as corresponding to the predefined anatomical region, defining the respective region of interest that contains the identified anatomical region and cropping the initial image to obtain a respective cropped image containing the respective region of interest.
3. The computerimplemented method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the predefined anatomical region of the character comprises one of a hand, an elbow and an underarm. 4. The computer-implemented method of any one of claims 1 to 3, further comprising resizing the respective region of interest to a predefined resolution.
5. The computer-implemented method of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein each one of the latent spatial features are represented by an N-dimensional block of data.
6. The computer-implemented method of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the latent spatial features are chosen so as to localize at least one of salient visual cues and visual forms and relationships.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 7, wherein the salient visual cues comprises at least one of edges, colors, patterns and shapes.
8. The computer-implemented method of any one claims 1 to 8, wherein the sequence of initial images correspond to video frames.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 8, wherein said receiving the sequence of initial images comprises receiving a live video.
10. A system for detecting a holding in images, the system comprising: a region of interest (ROI) extractor configured for receiving a sequence of initial images representing at least partially an entity and for each initial image, determining a respective region of interest around a predefined anatomical region of the character to obtain a sequence of regions of interest; a spatial feature extractor configured for extracting latent spatial features from region of interest to obtain a sequence of latent spatial features for each region of interest, the latent spatial features being indicative of the holding; a temporal feature extractor configured for generating a set of latent spatiotemporal features from the sequences of latent spatial features, the set of latent spatiotemporal features representing a sequence of visual states; and a classifier configured for determining from the set of spatiotemporal features whether the region of interest comprises the holding and outputting an indication as to whether the holding is associated with the region of interest.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the ROI extractor is configured for, for each initial image, identifying an anatomical region of the character as corresponding to the predefined anatomical region, defining the respective region of interest that contains the identified anatomical region and cropping the initial image to obtain a respective cropped image containing the respective region of interest.
12. The system of claim 10 or 11, wherein the predefined anatomical region of the character comprises one of a hand, an elbow and an underarm.
13. The system of any one of claims 10 to 12, wherein the ROI extractor is further configured for resizing the respective region of interest to a predefined resolution.
14. The system of any one of claims 10 to 13, wherein each one of the latent spatial features are represented by an N-dimensional block of data.
15. The system of any one of claims 10 to 14, wherein the latent spatial features are chosen so as to localize at least one of salient visual cues and visual forms and relationships.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the salient visual cues comprises at least one of edges, colors, patterns and shapes.
17. The system of any one claims 10 to 16, wherein the sequence of initial images correspond to video frames.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the video frames are part of a live video.
