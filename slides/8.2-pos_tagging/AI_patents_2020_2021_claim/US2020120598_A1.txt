<title>
A WIRELESS EVENT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
An event notification system includes a wireless device, an Access Point device, a server, and a user application. The server is configured to receive a plurality of heartbeats from the wireless device and through the Access Point device, and send a heartbeat response of a plurality of heartbeat responses in response to a respective heartbeat of the plurality of heartbeats. The user application is configured to send enable and disable commands to the server. The enable command is sent to the wireless device as part of the next heartbeat response of the plurality of heartbeat responses. The disable command is sent to the wireless device after the server receives an event condition from the wireless device through the AP device.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An event notification system comprising: a wireless device including a sensor for detecting an event; an Access Point (AP) device; a controller configured to receive a plurality of heartbeats from the wireless device and through the AP device, and send a heartbeat response of a plurality of heartbeat responses to a respective heartbeat of the plurality of heartbeats; and a user application configured to send sensor enable and disable commands to the controller, wherein the sensor enable command is sent to the wireless device as part of the next heartbeat response of the plurality of heartbeat responses, and the sensor disable command is sent to the wireless device after the controller receives an event condition from the wireless device through the AP device.
2. The event notification system set forth in claim 1, wherein the event notification system is a security system, the sensor enable command is an arm command, and the sensor disable command is a disarm command.
3. The event notification system set forth in claim 1, wherein the controller is at least part of a cloud server.
4. The event notification system jet forth in claim 3, wherein the cloud server includes a virtual security panel.
5. The event notification system set forth in claim 1, wherein the user application is a mobile application.
6. The event notification system set forth in claim 1, wherein the wireless device is a Power Save Mode (PSM) device.
7. The event notification system set forth in claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to send a disabled response to the user application in response to receiving the disable command and without sending the disable command to the wireless device via the AP device.
8. 8.The event notification system set forth in claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to buffer the disable command and suppress the event condition prior to the controller sending the disable command to the wireless device after receipt of the event condition.
9. The event notification system set forth in claim S, wherein the controller is configured to buffer the enable command prior to the controller sending rite enable command to the wireless device via the next heartbeat response.
10. The event notification system set forth in claim 1, wherein the wireless device includes a plurality of awake states intervened by a plurality of sleep states, and each heartbeat of the plurality of heartbeats are sent during a respective awake state of the plurality of awake states.
11. The event notification system set forth in claim 10, wherein the event notification system is a non-beacon-tracking security system.
12. A method of operating an event notification system comprising: sending a disable command from a user application to a controller; sending an effective disabled response from the controller to the user application in response to the disable command; and buffering the disable command by the controller.
13. The method set forth in claim 12, wherein the controller is a virtual panel that is pan of a cloud server.
14. The method set forth in claim 12, further comprising: sending an event condition from a Power Save Mode (PSM) device, through an Access Point (AP) device, and to the controller; suppressing the event condition at the controller while the disable command is buffered: and sending the buffered disable command from the controller, through the AP device, and to the PSM device in response to receipt of the event condition.
15. The method set forth in claim 14, further comprising: sending an enable command from the user application to the controller, buffering the enable command by the controller; sending a heartbeat from live PSM device, through the AP device, and to the controller; sending a heartbeat response from the controller, through the AP device, and to the PSM device, wherein the heartbeat response includes the enable command and is in response to the heartbeat.
16. The method set forth in claim 15, further comprising: enabling the PSM device after receiving the heartbeat response; and sending an enabled confirmation signal from the PSM device, through the controller, and to the user application.
17. The method set forth in claim 16, wherein the AP device is a router.
18. The method set forth in claim 16, wherein the user application is a smart phone.
19. The method set forth in claim 16, wherein the event notification system is a security system, enable command is an arm command, and the disable command is a disarm command.
20. An event notification system comprising: a wireless device including a sensor for detecting an event; a gateway device; a controller configured to send commands to the wireless device and through the gateway device; and a user application configured to send sensor enable and disable commands to the controller, wherein the sensor enable command is sent to the wireless device through the gateway within periodic awake intervals of the wireless device, and the sensor disable command is sent to the wireless device within periodic awake intervals of the wireless device or after the controller receives an event condition from the wireless device through the gateway.
