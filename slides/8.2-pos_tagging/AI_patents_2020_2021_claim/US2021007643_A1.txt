SYSTEM FOR COLLECTING AND UTILIZING HEALTH DATA
</title>

<abstract>
A system for collecting and utilizing health data can include collecting data relative to a patient's health and aggregating the data with other sources of data to define a database. The patient data can be collected using an electronic device, such as a smart contact lens or smart contact lens container. The data within the database can be manipulated, organized, or otherwise processed to determine trends, relationships, and other characteristics of the database. The characteristics of the database can be correlated to predict a health condition of the patient, generate a healthcare recommendation, or a combination thereof.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method of health monitoring, comprising: collecting current user health data; receiving archived user health data from a database; aggregating the user submitted health data with the archived user health data; analyzing, using a processor, the aggregated health data; and correlating the aggregated health data with a health condition indicator to predict a health condition of the user.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein analyzing the aggregated health data comprises at least one of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data mining.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein collecting current user health data from a user comprises receiving user health data from a smart contact lens.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the smart contact lens is configured to measure an intraocular eye pressure of the user.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the smart contact lens is configured to measure glucose levels in a tear fluid.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein collecting current user health data includes using a smart contact lens container.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the smart contact lens container is configured to measure at least one biomarker characteristic of a biomarker within the smart contact lens container.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the at least one biomarker characteristic comprises identifying a type of biomarker or a concentration of biomarker within the smart contact lens container.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising generating a healthcare recommendation based on the correlation.
10. A method of health monitoring, comprising: collecting current user health data; receiving archived user health data from a database; aggregating the current user health data with the archived user health data; analyzing, using a processor, the aggregated health data; and correlating the aggregated health data to generate a recommendation.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the recommendation includes recommending at least one of a medical examination, a contact lens, and a physician.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein the current user health data includes at least one of age, gender, weight, height, and place of domicile.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein analyzing the aggregated health data comprises at least one of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data mining.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein collecting current user health data comprises using a smart contact lens.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the smart contact lens is configured to wirelessly communicate with another electronic device.
16. The method of claim 10, wherein collecting current user health data includes using a smart contact lens container.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the smart contact lens container is configured to wirelessly communicate with another electronic device.
18. A method of health monitoring, comprising: collecting current user health data, wherein collecting current user health data includes at least one of: detecting, using a smart contact lens, a glucose concentration within optical fluid; detecting, using the smart contact lens, an intraocular pressure of an eye, the intraocular pressure being at least one of a relative intraocular pressure or absolute intraocular pressure; and detecting, using the smart contact lens container, a biomarker characteristic; receiving archived user health data from a database; aggregating the current user health data with the archived user health data; analyzing, using a processor, the aggregated health data; wherein analyzing the aggregated health data includes implementing, using the processor, data mining algorithms; and correlating the aggregated health data with a health condition indicator to generate a predicted health condition of the user.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein: the smart contact lens is configured to transmit the current user health data after collecting the current user health data; receiving the current user health data includes receiving the current user health data at an electronic device; aggregating the current user health data with the archived user health data includes storing the current user health data within the database; and the predicted health condition of the user is received at a mobile device of the user.
20. The method of claim 18, wherein: the glucose concentration is detected using a glucose sensor positioned on a surface of the smart contact lens; the relative intraocular pressure is detected using a variable capacitance sensor operably coupled to the smart contact lens; the absolute intraocular pressure is detected using a tonometer operably coupled to the smart contact lens; and the biomarker characteristic is at least one of a type or concentration of a biomarker within the smart contact lens container.
