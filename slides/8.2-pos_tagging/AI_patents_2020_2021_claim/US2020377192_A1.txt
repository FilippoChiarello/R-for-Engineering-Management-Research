AIRCRAFT BASED NON-DEDICATED SPECIAL MISSION POD MOUNTING APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
Particular embodiments include a mission payload mounting apparatus. The mission payload apparatus includes a pressurized door plug assembly on a side of an aircraft fuselage and a strut having a first end and a second end. The strut extends from an interior of the aircraft fuselage through the pressurized door plug assembly to an exterior of the aircraft fuselage. The first end of the strut is connected to the interior of the aircraft fuselage. One or more payloads are attached to the strut.

<claims>
1. A mission payload mounting apparatus comprising: a pressurized door plug assembly on a side of an aircraft fuselage; and a strut having a first end and a second end, wherein: the strut extends from an interior of the aircraft fuselage through the pressurized door plug assembly to an exterior of the aircraft fuselage; the first end of the strut is coupled to an adaptive mounting system (AMS) plate adapted to attach to one or more air deployment system (ADS) rails of the aircraft fuselage, the one or more ADS rails being fixed parallel to a longitudinal axis of the aircraft fuselage; and one or more payloads are attached to the strut.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the strut is operable to, in flight: extend the one or more payloads from the interior of the aircraft fuselage to the exterior of the aircraft fuselage; and retract the one or more payloads from the exterior of the aircraft fuselage to the interior of the aircraft fuselage.
3. The apparatus of Claim h wherein the strut provides an internal wiring harness and cable conduit from the interior of the aircraft fuselage to the one or more payloads.
4. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the strut provides payload connectivity to one or more on-board systems of the aircraft fuselage, wherein the on-board systems comprise one or more of: an on-board workstation; an aircraft positional data system; a communications system; or a data processing system.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the strut is a non-actuated fixed-position strut and fairing apparatus.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the strut is capable of being rotationally actuated about an axis.
7. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the axis is exterior to the aircraft fuselage.
8. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the one or more payloads are attached to the strut between the axis and the second end.
9. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the one or more payloads are attached the second end of the strut.
10. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the strut is capable of being articulated to a position where the second end of the strut is below a lower periphery of the aircraft fuselage.
11. (canceled) .
12. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the AMS plate is adapted to attach to the one or more ADS rails via one or more restraint or bolt devices.
13. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising one or more removable load transfer braces (LTBs) which interface to the AMS plate and extend inboard from the AMS plate to interface with a floor of the aircraft fuselage.
14. The apparatus of claim 13, wherein: the one or more LTBs are hinged to the AMS plate via one or more flanges; and the one or more LTBs can be rotated to a vertical position via the one or more flanges upon disconnection of the interface with the floor of the aircraft fuselage.
15. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a shoulder armature assembly coupled to the first end of the strut, wherein the strut is coupled to the AMS plate via the shoulder armature assembly.
16. The apparatus of claim 15, further comprising a wrist armature assembly, wherein the wrist armature assembly is coupled to the second end of the strut.
17. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the one or more payloads comprise one or more of: an ordinance rack; an electro optical, radar, or radio-frequency sensor; a surveillance and targeting sensor turret; a communications pod; or an infra-red detection set.
18. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the pressurized door plug assembly comprises: a single piece door plug; or a combined door plug upper panel and door plug lower panel.
19. A method comprising: coupling a first end of a strut to an adaptive mounting system (AMS) plate adapted to attach to one or more air deployment system (ADS) rails of an aircraft fuselage, the one or more ADS rails being fixed parallel to a longitudinal axis of the aircraft fuselage; and installing a pressurized door plug assembly on a side of the aircraft fuselage wherein: the strut extends from an interior of the aircraft fuselage to an exterior of the aircraft fuselage through the pressurized door plug assembly; and one or more payloads are attached to the strut.
20. The method of claim 19, further comprising: actuating the strut in flight to extend the one or more payloads from the interior of the aircraft fuselage to the exterior of the aircraft fuselage.
