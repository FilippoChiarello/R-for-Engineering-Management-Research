NON-TRANSITORY COMPUTER-READABLE STORAGE MEDIUM STORING ESTIMATION PROGRAM, ESTIMATION DEVICE, AND ESTIMATION METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An estimation method is performed by a computer for estimating a far field of electromagnetic waves or heat. The method includes: generating an emphasis pattern image obtained by emphasizing each target element of a pattern image of a target circuit by an emphasizing method that corresponds to a type of each target element, with respect to the target element which is at least a part of elements included in the target circuit; and estimating the far field of electromagnetic waves or heat radiated from the target circuit by an existing estimation model using the emphasis pattern image.
