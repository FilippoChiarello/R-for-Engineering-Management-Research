ORTHODONTIC APPLIANCES INCLUDING AT LEAST PARTIALLY UN-ERUPTED TEETH AND METHOD OF FORMING THEM
</title>

<abstract>
The example systems, methods, and/or computer-readable media described herein help with design of highly accurate models of un-erupted or partially erupted teeth and help fabricate of aligners for un-erupted or partially erupted teeth. Automated agents that use machine learning models to parametrically represent three-dimensional (3d) virtual representations of teeth as 3D descriptors in a 3D descriptor space are provided herein. In some implementations, the automated agents described herein provide instructions to fabricate aligners for at least partially un-erupted teeth using representative 3D descriptor(s) of a tooth type.
