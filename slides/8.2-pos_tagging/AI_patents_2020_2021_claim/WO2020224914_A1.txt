HEARING DEVICE SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROCESSING AUDIO SIGNALS
</title>

<abstract>
A hearing device system (1) and the method for processing audio signals are described. The hearing device system (1) has at least one hearing device (2) having a recording device (5) for recording an input signal (E), at least one neural network (7) for separating at least one audio signal from the input signal (E) and a playback device(6) for playing back an output signal (A) ascertained from the at least audio signal. A calibration device (3) is connected to the at least one hearing device (2) in the data-transmitting manner. The at least one neural network (7) is customizable and/or replaceable by the calibration device (3).
