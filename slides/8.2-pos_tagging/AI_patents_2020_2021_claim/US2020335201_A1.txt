METHOD FOR SETTING A MEDICAL IMAGING PROTOCOL, SYSTEM FOR SETTING A MEDICAL INSTRUMENT, COMPUTER PROGRAM AND COMPUTER-READABLE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A method for setting a medical imaging protocol includes providing an information data set assigned to a patient. The information data set includes an information about a provisional diagnostic finding regarding the patient. In an embodiment, the method further includes assigning a probability value for a positive finding of the provisional diagnostic finding to the information data set; and automatically setting the medical imaging protocol. The medical imaging protocol is adapted to the provisional diagnostic finding such that an analysis of a result of the medical imaging protocol changes the probability value.

<claims>
1. A method for setting a medical imaging protocol via a controller, comprising: providing an information data set assigned to a patient, the information data set including information about a provisional diagnostic finding regarding the patient; assigning a probability value for a positive finding of the provisional diagnostic finding to the information data set provided; and automatically setting the medical imaging protocol, the medical imaging protocol being adapted to the provisional diagnostic finding such that an analysis of a result of the medical imaging protocol changes the probability value assigned.
2. The method of claim 1, comprising: executing the medical imaging protocol.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein a list including potential imaging findings is provided for selecting one medical imaging protocol, wherein a probability value is assigned to each of potential image finding of the potential image findings.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the information data set is at least one of based on a patient related data base and created via an input device.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein a trained artificial neural network is used for providing the medical imaging protocol.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein a further probability value is provided after the automatically setting of the medical imaging protocol.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the medical imaging protocol includes at least one of a type of modality and a configuration parameter for at least one of configuring a medical imaging device and reconstructing a medical imagine data set of the medical imaging device.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein at least one of the probability value, a further probability value and the medical imaging protocol are provided to a user via at least one of a screen (and an output device.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the information data set includes at least one of: an initial assessment, constraints for imaging, and a result of previous examination.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein at least one of the probability value and a further probability value are assigned by using a further artificial neural network.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the medical imaging protocol includes at least one of an information about a body region, a contrast information, a coding information and a billing information.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein at least a portion of the method is performed at a server or system of server.
13. A system for setting a medical instrument with a medical imaging protocol, the system being configured to provide an information data set assigned to a patient, the information data set including information about a provisional diagnostic finding regarding the patient; assign a probability value for a positive finding of the provisional diagnostic finding to the information data set provided; and automatically set the medical imaging protocol, the medical imaging protocol being adapted to the provisional diagnostic finding such that an analysis of an outcome being result of the medical imaging protocol changes the probability value assigned.
14. A non-transitory computer program product, storing program elements for carrying out the method of claim 1 when the computer program product is loaded into a memory of a programmable device and the program elements are executed.
15. A non-transitory computer-readable medium, storing program elements, readable and executable by a computer unit, to perform the method of claims 1 when the program elements are executed by the computer unit.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein the medical imaging protocol suggests a specific configuration for at least one of setting a medical imaging device and reconstructing a medical imaging data set, being recorded with the medical imaging device, and wherein the specific configuration is adapted to be specialized to the provisional diagnostic finding.
17. The method of claim 2, wherein a list including potential imaging findings is provided for selecting one medical imaging protocol, wherein a probability value is assigned to each of potential image finding of the potential image findings.
18. The method of claim 2, wherein the information data set is at least one of based on a patient related data base and created via an input device.
19. The method of claim 2, wherein a trained artificial neural network is used for providing the medical imaging protocol.
20. A non-transitory computer-readable medium, storing program elements, readable and executable by a computer unit, to perform the method of claim 2 when the program elements are executed by the computer unit.
