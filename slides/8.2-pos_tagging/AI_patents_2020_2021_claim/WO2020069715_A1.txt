IDENTIFICATION OF COPIED ML MODEL
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided mechanisms for a manufacturer of an ML model to embed at least one marker in an electronic file. A method comprises obtaining the electronic file. The electronic file represents content that causes the ML model to determine an output for the electronic file according to a first processing strategy. The method comprises embedding, in the electronic file, the at least one marker that, only when detected by the ML model, causes the output of the electronic file to be determined according to a second processing strategy. The second processing strategy is unrelated to the first processing strategy and deterministically defined by the at least one marker.
