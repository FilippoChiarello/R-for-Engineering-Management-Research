<title>
IMAGE FORMING DEVICE, EYEGLASS LENS SELECTION SYSTEM, IMAGE FORMING METHOD, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
An image generating device includes: a feature detection unit that detects features in a captured image obtained by capturing an image of a subject looking at a display device, a parameter calculation unit that calculates a distance between the subject and the display device and an orientation of a face of the subject based upon positions of the features having been detected and/or a distance between the features having been detected, an image generation unit that generates an image of a virtual visual field, which is to be viewed by the subject looking at the display device through an eyeglass lens, based upon the distance between the subject and the display device and the orientation of the face; and a display control unit that causes the display device to display the image of the virtual visual field.

<claims>
1. An image generating device, comprising: a feature detection unit that detects features in a captured image obtained by capturing an image of a subject looking at a display device; a parameter calculation unit that calculates a distance between the subject and the display device and an orientation of a face of the subject based upon positions of the features having been detected and/or a distance between the features having been detected; an image generation unit that generates an image of a virtual visual field, which is to be viewed by the subject looking at the display device through an eyeglass lens, based upon the distance between the subject and the display device and the orientation of the face; and a display control unit that causes the display device to display the image of the virtual visual field.
2. The image generating device according to claim 1, wherein: the parameter calculation unit calculates an eye position with respect to an eye of the subject based upon the positions of the features having been detected and/or the distance between the features having been detected; and the image generation unit generates an image of a virtual visual field to be viewed by the subject looking at the display device through the eyeglass lens from the eye position, based upon the eye position, the distance between the subject and the display device and the orientation of the face.
3. The image generating device according to claim 2, wherein:
the image generation unit generates the image of the virtual visual field to be viewed by the subject looking at a virtual object located at a position taken by the display device.
4. The image generating device according to claim 3, wherein:
the image generation unit constructs a three-dimensional virtual space that contains the object and adjusts an angle of view of the image of the virtual visual field in correspondence to a size of a display screen of the display device regardless of the eye position.
5. The image generating device according to claim 4, wherein:
the image generation unit calculates a local skew attributable to the eyeglass lens based upon a direction along which light having departed the eye exits the eyeglass lens.
6. The image generating device according to claim 4 or claim 5, wherein:
the image generation unit calculates an aberration quantity indicating extent of aberration occurring at a retina of the eye based upon a result obtained by tracing rays of light, having departed points on the object set in the virtual space, transmitted through the eyeglass lens and entering the retina, and generates the image of the virtual visual field that is blurred through a convolution operation executed based upon the aberration quantity.
7. The image generating device according to claim 6, wherein:
the image generation unit calculates the aberration quantity based upon at least one of accommodation ability of the subject, an age of the subject and prescription data pertaining to the subject.
8. The image generating device according to claim 6 or claim 7, wherein:
the image generation unit alters a kernel of the convolution operation based upon the distance between the subject and the display device.
9. The image generating device according to any one of claims 1 through 8, wherein:
the parameter calculation unit calculates a position and an attitude of the eyeglass lens while generating the image of the virtual visual field based upon prescription data pertaining to the subject and/or measurement values obtained through actual measurement conducted on the subject wearing the eyeglass lens.
10. The image generating device according to any one of claims 1 through 9, wherein:
the feature detection unit detects the features in a portion of the captured image that corresponds to at least one of the face of the subject and a member disposed at the head of the subject.
11. An eyeglass lens selection system, comprising: the image generating device according to any one of claims 1 through 10; the display device; and an image capturing unit that captures an image of the subject looking at the display device.
12. A method for image generation, comprising: detecting features in a captured image obtained by capturing an image of a subject looking at a display device; calculating a distance between the subject and the display device and an orientation of a face of the subject based upon positions of the features having been detected and/or a distance between the features having been detected; generating an image of a virtual visual field, which is to be viewed by the subject looking at the display device through an eyeglass lens, based upon the distance between the subject and the display device and the orientation of the face; and causing the display device to display the image of the virtual visual field.
13. A program that enables a processing device to execute: feature detection processing through which features are detected in a captured image obtained by capturing an image of a subject looking at a display device; parameter calculation processing through which a distance between the subject and the display device and an orientation of a face of the subject are calculated based upon positions of the features having been detected and/or a distance between the features having been detected; image generation processing through which an image of a virtual visual field that is to be viewed by the subject looking at the display device through an eyeglass lens is generated based upon the distance between the subject and the display device and the orientation of the face; and display control processing through which the image of the virtual visual field is displayed at the display device.
