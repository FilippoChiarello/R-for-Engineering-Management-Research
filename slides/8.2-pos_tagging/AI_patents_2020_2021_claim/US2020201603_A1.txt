SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A semiconductor device having a novel structure is provided. The semiconductor device includes a plurality of operation circuits that can switch different kinds of operation processing; a plurality of switch circuits that can switch a connection state between the operation circuits; and a controller. The operation circuit includes a first memory that stores data corresponding to a weight parameter used in the plurality of kinds of operation processing. The operation circuit executes a product-sum operation by switching weight data in accordance with a context. The switch circuit includes a second memory that stores data for switching a plurality of connection states in response to switching of a second context signal. The controller generates a second context signal on the basis of a first context signal. The amount of data stored in the second memory can be smaller than the amount of data stored in the first memory in the operation circuit.
