<title>
APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR VISUALIZING AND OPERATING ON LARGE DATA SETS ACCESSIBLE VIA A GRAPH
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus and method for processing a data set based on received input of one or more search criterion, wherein the data set is a set of data accessible via a graph comprising nodes including a root node, wherein a hierarchical level of a node is determined by a number of nodes in a shortest route through the graph from the node to the root node and is highest at the root node. The processing results in the display of a user-interactive visual representation of the data set as a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional structure that extends in first, second and third mutually orthogonal directions, and has a series of adjacent layers, each layer corresponding to a hierarchical level of the graph, wherein an ordering of the series of adjacent layers is in the first direction and corresponds to an ordering of the hierarchical levels. The visual representation comprises at least a line of one or more items spread within the corresponding layer in a direction parallel to the second direction , to represent first nodes that are in the corresponding hierarchical level and which are access points to data which matches the one or more search criterion, and uses at least a stack of items stacked in a direction parallel to the third direction , in the corresponding layer, to represent second nodes that are in the hierarchical level, the second nodes being access points to data that are not first nodes but which have a same or higher hierarchical level as a first node, such that there is an item and/or a stack of items at each node in a shortest route through the graph from each first node to the root node.

wherein the data set is a set of data accessible via a graph comprising nodes including a root node, wherein a hierarchical level of a node is determined by a number of nodes in a shortest route through the graph from the node to the root node and is highest at the root node, and
wherein the processing classifies nodes, based on the received input one or more search criterion, as first nodes or second nodes
wherein the first nodes are access points to data that is determined to be a search match for the received input one or more search criterion and
wherein the second nodes are access points to data, are not first nodes and have a same or higher hierarchical level as a first node; causing display of a user-interactive visual representation of the data set wherein the user-interactive visual representation of the data set is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional structure that extends in first, second and third mutually orthogonal directions, and has a series of adjacent layers, each layer corresponding to a hierarchical level of the graph, wherein an ordering of the series of adjacent layers is in the first direction and corresponds to an ordering of the hierarchical levels, wherein the three-dimensional structure, for each hierarchical level: uses at least a line of one or more items, in the corresponding layer, to represent first nodes that are in the hierarchical level, wherein the line of items is spread within the corresponding layer in a direction parallel to the second direction, wherein each of the first nodes that are in the hierarchical level has a corresponding item in the line of items, uses at least a stack of items, in the corresponding layer, to represent second nodes that are in the hierarchical level wherein the stack of items are items stacked within the corresponding layer in a stacking direction parallel to the third direction; and wherein there is an item and/or a stack of items at each node in a shortest route through the graph from each first node to the root node.
2. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the means for receiving input of one or more search criterion comprises means for inputting unstructured text comprising one or more identifiers present in the data set and associated with nodes, and means for extracting the one or more identifiers from the unstructured text and using them as the one or more search criterion.
3. An apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein the means for inputting unstructured text enables a user to drag-and-drop or cut-and-paste the unstructured text or an object defining the unstructured text.
4. An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the apparatus comprises means for storing identifiers of the first nodes as anchor points for reproducing the two-dimensional representation.
5. An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, comprising means for controlling the two-dimensional representation of the three-dimensional structure so that the three-dimensional structure is rotated in space.
6. An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, comprising means for enabling a user to convert a stack of items stacked in the third direction to a line of items spread in a direction parallel to the second direction, and for enabling the user to covert the line of items back into the stack of items.
7. An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, comprising means for enabling a user to select an item and cause display of at least some of the data accessible via the node represented by the selected item and display of one or more options for using the data accessible via the node represented by the selected item to perform one or more functions.
8. An apparatus as claimed in any claim 7 comprising means for using the data accessible via the node represented by the selected item to automatically populate a recipient field of an email.
9. An apparatus as claimed in claim 7 or 8, comprising means for enabling a user to display at least some of the data associated with a first node represented by an item in the line of items without selecting the item.
10. An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, comprising means for: accessing other data that is a different collection of data than the data set; identifying nodes that are access points to data that matches the other data; and visually flagging an item representing the identified node.
11. An apparatus as claimed in claim 10, comprising means for enabling a user to select a visually flagged item within a stack of items and cause display of at least some of the other data matching
the data accessible via the node represented by the visually flagged item.
12. An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein each item is a two-dimensional item that extends parallel to the first direction and the second direction but does not extend or extend significantly parallel to the third direction.
13. An apparatus as claimed in any preceding, wherein the item is a two-dimensional rectangular card that has first parallel edges that are parallel to the first direction, second parallel edges that are parallel to the second direction and corners where the first parallel edges and the second parallel edges meet, wherein the stacked items are a stack of the cards viewed from a perspective such that corners of the cards in the stack are aligned parallel to the third direction.
