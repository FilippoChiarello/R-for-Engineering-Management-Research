BIOMETRIC RECOGNITION APPARATUS AND BIOMETRIC RECOGNITION METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
Provided is a biometric recognition apparatus and a fingerprint feature extraction method that can automatically optimize parameters used for extracting a feature template from a biometric image. The biometric recognition apparatus includes: a teacher data generation unit that generates a genuine pair and an imposter pair of a first biometric image and a second biometric image; a learning data generation unit that uses a plurality of different temporary parameters to extract feature templates from the first biometric image and the second biometric image; and an optimum solution determination unit that calculates a score separation degree on the temporary parameter basis based on a first score representing a similarity degree of a pair of the feature templates extracted from the genuine pair and a second score representing a similarity degree of a pair of the feature templates extracted from the imposter pair and determines the temporary parameter based on a level of the score separation degree.

<claims>
1. A biometric recognition apparatus comprising: a teacher data generation unit that generates a genuine pair and an imposter pair of a first biometric image and a second biometric image; a learning data generation unit that uses a plurality of different temporary parameters to extract feature templates from the first biometric image and the second biometric image; and an optimum solution determination unit that calculates a score separation degree on the temporary parameter basis based on a first score representing a similarity degree of a pair of the feature templates extracted from the genuine pair and a second score representing a similarity degree of a pair of the feature templates extracted from the imposter pair and determines the temporary parameter based on a level of the score separation degree.
2. The biometric recognition apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the optimum solution determination unit determines the temporary parameter based on the score separation degree which is the largest.
3. The biometric recognition apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the optimum solution determination unit calculates the first score and the second score for each of the first biometric image or the second biometric image, and calculates, as the score separation degree, a ratio of the first score ranked top.
4. The biometric recognition apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the optimum solution determination unit removes the genuine pair having the first score greater than or equal to a predetermined value from a calculation process of the score separation degree.
5. The biometric recognition apparatus according to claim 1 further comprising: a storage unit that stores a parameter used for extracting the feature templates from the first biometric image and the second biometric image; and a parameter update unit that updates the parameter stored in the storage unit with the determined temporary parameter.
6. The biometric recognition apparatus according to claim 1, wherein a pair of the first biometric image and the second biometric image is a pair of collected images of a fingerprint or a palm print, and wherein the feature templates form a feature point group of a fingerprint or a palm print.
7. The biometric recognition apparatus according to claim 6, wherein a pair of the first biometric image and the second biometric image is a pair of a collected image of a latent fingerprint and a collected image of a tenprint fingerprint.
8. The biometric recognition apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the temporary parameter includes a combination of a noise reduction process and an enhancement process and a weight.
9. A biometric recognition method used in a control calculation unit of a biometric recognition apparatus, the biometric recognition method comprising: a teacher data generation step of generating a genuine pair and an imposter pair of a first biometric image and a second biometric image; a learning data generation step of using a plurality of different temporary parameters to extract feature templates from the first biometric image and the second biometric image; and an optimum solution determination step of calculating a score separation degree on the temporary parameter basis based on a first score representing a similarity degree of a pair of the feature templates extracted from the genuine pair and a second score representing a similarity degree of a pair of the feature templates extracted from the imposter pair and determining the temporary parameter based on a level of the score separation degree.
