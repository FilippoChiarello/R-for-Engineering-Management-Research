VEHICLE PHOTOGRAPHIC SYSTEM FOR IDENTIFICATION OF SURFACE IMPERFECTIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method are provided for determining surface defects of an object under study. A photographic tool is employed to produce real-time blending of a series of images of a static object where each of the individual images are illuminated under a different lighting condition with respect to the static object. The achieved effect is similar to what is experienced when looking at a painted surface from different perspectives in order to see if there are any imperfections. For example, in the case of automotive photography, paint problems, sheen differences, scratches, dents, and small dings may only be visible when the vehicle is lit from a specific or correct angle.

<claims>
1. A system for determining vehicle surface defects, the system comprising: an enclosable drive-in structure having one or more doors, a wall and a ceiling;
a plurality of cameras, with at least one of camera mounted in each of said one or more doors, said wall and said ceiling, said camera providing images or video to a computing system; a cluster of lighting elements associated with each of said plurality of cameras, said clusters of lighting elements positioned in said one or more doors, said wall and said ceiling; a trigger mechanism for each of said plurality of cameras to take exposures through an automated lighting cycle of each of the associated clusters of lights as a light beam generated by said cluster of lighting elements sweeps across a vehicle surface.
2. The system of claim 1 wherein said clusters of lighting elements are in a semicircle.
3. The system of claim 1 wherein said clusters of lighting elements are in a circle.
4. The system of claim 1 wherein said cluster of lighting elements are arranged as concentric rings of lighting for converting an image to a point cloud for a three dimensional (3D) rendering of the vehicle.
5. The system of claim 1 wherein at least one of said one or more doors, said walls and said ceiling are painted black.
6. The system of claim 1 wherein all of said one or more doors, said walls and said ceiling are painted black.
7. The system of any one of claims 1 to 6 further comprising a machine learning capability to identify surface defects.
8. The system of any one of claims 1 to 6 further comprising a central process unit (CPU), said CPU coordinates and controls said cameras, said lighting system; and
wherein a communication interface connects said plurality of cameras via one or more of wired and wireless links, optical drives, universal serial bus (USB), flash memory slot, and combinations thereof for receiving and sending data.
9. The system of claim 1 wherein an image stack of photos taken by a camera with a series of different lighting angles is supplied to a computer workstation, where the image stack of photos are combined into a single blended image by a user.
10. The system of claim 9 wherein said computer workstation further comprises a joy stick controller, a mouse, a keyboard, and a display monitor.
11. The system of claim 9 wherein said computer workstation further comprises a graphical user interface (GUI) with which an operator can, zoom, pan, and change the lighting as needed to revel any surface issues that may need a closer look as seen in the blended image.
12. The system of claim 1 further comprising a switchable filter or light polarizer that is positioned in front of one or more of a lens of a camera or cluster of lighting elements.
13. The system of claim 12 wherein at least one of infra-red (IR) lighting, polarization, color polarization, and cross polarization is used to identify vehicle surface defects.
14. The system of claim 1 further comprising a radio frequency identification (RFID) reader or alphanumeric reader for identifying vehicle and client parameters upon entry into said structure.
15. The system of claim 14 wherein said RFID reader or said alphanumeric reader obtains the vehicle identification number (VIN) of the vehicle to be processed;
wherein a set of information related to the vehicle is encoded in said VIN, said set of information comprising one or more of vehicle make, model, body style, and vehicle color.
16. The system of claim 1 wherein the images of the vehicle are uploaded in a database.
17. The system of claim 16 wherein the database further comprises vehicle and client informationÂ·
18. A process for photographing a vehicle with the system of any of claims 1 to 6 comprising:
driving the vehicle through said door into said enclosable drive-in structure;
selectively illuminating a first cluster of lights arrayed in said structure and associated with a first camera;
collecting a first set of photographs of the vehicle with illumination from said first subset of lights;
supplying the first set of photographs to a computer workstation; creating a blended photograph made up of the first set of photographs at the computer workstation; and
analyzing the blended image.
