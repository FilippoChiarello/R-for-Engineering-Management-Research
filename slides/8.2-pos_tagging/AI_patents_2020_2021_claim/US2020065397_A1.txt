<title>
Selective data migration and sharing
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for sharing information from a first user account to a second user account selectively and seamlessly. The systems and methods can be implemented by server(s) that analyze electronic transactions between the first user account and the second user account to determine appropriate queries for the accounts for sharing information. Such queries can include queries for file permissions. Also, the server(s) can generate sharing instructions according to results of the queries. The server(s) can also select electronic content items for sharing according to the generated sharing instructions. And, the server(s) can direct storage of a copy of the selected electronic content items of the first user account into a data structure of the second user account, such that access by the second user account to the selected items from the first account is as seamless as accessing electronic content items originated by the second user account.

3. The method of claim 1, wherein the querying of the second user account further comprises querying the second user account for types of information it is willing to receive, which results in the permission indications of the second user account, the querying the second user account for types of information it is willing to receive is selected from the group consisting of: querying the second user account for permission to receive emails, querying the second user account for permission to receive images comprising photographs and illustrations, querying the second user account for permission to receive documents, querying the second user account for permission to receive coupons, querying the second user account for permission to receive travel information, querying the second user account for permission to receive calendar and scheduling information, and any combination thereof.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the analyzing the electronic communications and other types of electronic transactions between the first user account and the second user account comprises filtering out spam, phishing, or other types of unwanted communications received by the first user account and the second user account.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the analyzing the electronic communications and other types of electronic transactions between the first user account and the second user account comprises determining a connection score between the first user account and the second user account according to machine learning, wherein the input of the machine learning comprises samples of the electronic communications and other types of electronic transactions between the first user account and the second user account.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: querying the first user account for access control parameters; receiving access control parameters from the first user account; and controlling access to the stored copy of the selected electronic content items according to the received access control parameters.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the received access control parameters are selected from the group consisting of: permission for permanent access to the stored copy of the selected electronic content items, permission for temporary access to the stored copy of the selected electronic content items, permission for synchronized updating of the stored copy of the selected electronic content items, permission for period updating of the stored copy of the selected electronic content items, permission for manual updating of the stored copy of the selected electronic content items, read permission for the stored copy of the selected electronic content items; write permission for the stored copy of the selected electronic content items; execution permission for the stored copy of the selected electronic content items if a part of the content is executable, instructions on revocation of access of the stored copy of the selected electronic content items, other instructions on management of access of the stored copy of the selected electronic content items, and any combination thereof.
8. The method of claim 6, wherein the received access control parameters are determined according to output of a content importance analyzer.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the content importance analyzer uses machine learning to determine access control parameters.
10. The method of claim 6, wherein the access control parameters, the sharing instructions, and metadata corresponding to the first and second electronic content items and other types of metadata are stored in a database.
11. The method of claim 6, wherein the access control parameters, the sharing instructions, and metadata corresponding to the first and second electronic content items and other types of metadata are stored in headers of at least the selected electronic content items.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising removing the stored copy of the selected electronic content items from the second data structure according to output of a security risk evaluator, wherein the security risk evaluator comprises machine learning and determinations of information removal by the security risk evaluator are enhanced by the machine learning.
13. The method of claim 1, further comprising removing the selected electronic content items from the first data structure according to output of a security risk evaluator, wherein the security risk evaluator comprises machine learning and determinations of information removal by the security risk evaluator are enhanced by the machine learning.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the first user account is a primary account of a user, and the second user account is a secondary user account of the user.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein the second data structure is independent of the first data structure.
