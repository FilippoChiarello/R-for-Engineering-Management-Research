Display device for vehicle
</title>

<abstract>
According to at least one embodiment, a display device for a vehicle includes: a display module configured to be installed in the vehicle and configured to display a GUI (Graphical User Interface); and a processor configured to change a touch area corresponding to the GUI according to a motion of the vehicle.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A display device for a vehicle, the display device comprising: a display; and a processor configured to: display at least one GUI (graphical user interface) on the display of the display device; identify a motion of the vehicle; and based on the motion of the vehicle, control the display to transfer a first area for identifying a user touch on a GUI of the displayed at least one GUI to a second area of the display.
2. The display device of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to execute an application corresponding to the GUI selected based on the user touch.
3. The display device of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: acquire map information and sensing information; and identify the motion of the vehicle based at least partially on the acquired map information or the acquired sensing information, wherein the map information includes a curvature and a flatness of a road corresponding to the vehicle.
4. The display device of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: acquire a touch displacement according to the motion of the vehicle from a memory of the display device; and control the display to transfer the first area to the second area based on the acquired touch displacement.
5. The display device of claim 4, wherein the processor is further configured to adjust the touch displacement according to a user weight identified by a pressure sensor installed in a seat within the vehicle.
6. The display device of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: receive a user touch at an area outside of the second area in the display; and update a touch displacement corresponding to the motion of the vehicle based on a coordinate of the received user touch.
7. The display device of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: identify touch habit information corresponding to the GUI from a memory of the display device; and control the display to transfer the first area corresponding to the GUI to the second area based on the identified touch habit information.
8. The display device of claim 7, wherein the processor is further configured to: receive a user touch at an area outside of the second area; and update the touch habit information based on a coordinate of the received user touch.
9. The display device of claim 7, wherein the processor is further configured to: acquire a value of an inertia parameter based on the motion of the vehicle; and update the touch habit information based on the acquired value of the inertia parameter being less than a reference value.
10. The display device of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: display, on the display, a first GUI and a second GUI which are arranged adjacent to each other; and control the display to overlap a touch area for identifying a user touch on the displayed first GUI with a display area for displaying on the display the second GUI.
11. The display device of claim 10, wherein the processor is further configured to: receive, via the display, a user touch at an overlap area between the touch area for identifying the user touch on the displayed first GUI and the display area for displaying the second GUI; and execute an application corresponding to the first GUI based on receiving the user touch at the overlap area.
12. The display device of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: identify a user operation to select a target GUI among the displayed at least one GUI; and change an area for identifying a user touch on the target GUI based on the identified user operation.
13. The display device of claim 12, wherein the processor is further configured to identify the target GUI based on the user operation being captured by an internal camera installed in the vehicle.
14. The display device of claim 12, wherein the processor is further configured to identify the target GUI based on a hovering inputted via the display.
15. The display device of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: receive, via the first area of the display, a first user touch for executing an application; receive a second user touch for canceling the execution of the application within a preset time; and update the first area based on a coordinate of the first user touch.
16. The display device of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: receive a user touch on a third area which overlaps both a touch area corresponding to a first GUI and a touch area corresponding to a second GUI; and execute an application corresponding to a GUI having a wider touch area overlapped by the user touch among the first GUI and the second GUI.
17. The display device of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to transfer a display area of the GUI corresponding to the second area.
18. A method for controlling a display device for a vehicle, the method comprising: displaying at least one GUI on a display of the display device; identifying a motion of the vehicle; and based on the motion of the vehicle, controlling the display to transfer a first area for identifying a user touch on a GUI of the displayed at least one GUI to a second area of the display.
19. The method of claim 18, further comprising: acquiring map information and sensing information; and identifying the motion of the vehicle based at least partially on the acquired map information or the acquired sensing information, wherein the map information includes a curvature and a flatness of a road corresponding to the vehicle.
20. The method of claim 18, further comprising: acquiring a touch displacement according to the motion of the vehicle from a memory of the display device; and controlling the display to transfer the first area to the second area based on the acquired touch displacement.
