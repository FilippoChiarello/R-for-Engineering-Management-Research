<title>
Directed Audio System for Audio Privacy and Audio Stream Customization
</title>

<abstract>
A system includes an audio transducer. The audio output of the transducer may be directed at an operator. The directionality of the audio output may ensure privacy in audio delivery. Further, the directionality of the audio output may reduce the potential for other nearby individuals to be disturbed by the audio output. A directed audio system may control the content of the audio output. The content of the audio output may be configured for applications in individual operator workspaces, multiple-operator common spaces, shared-use spaces or a combination thereof. The directed audio system may customize the audio output in accord with a stored audio profile for the operator.

<claims>
1. A method including: determining audio profiles associated with operators at multiple pre-defined operator locations; based on capture preferences within the audio profiles, receiving multiple captured audio streams from the multiple pre-defined operator locations; determining to generate a mix from a subset of the captured audio streams; and causing playback of the mix at a destination.
2. The method of claim 1, where the subset excludes at least a selected captured audio stream of the multiple captured audio streams.
3. The method of claim 2, where the selected captured audio stream is selected for exclusion based on a destination.
4. The method of claim 3, where the selected captured audio stream is selected for exclusion based on the destination by determining an identity of an operator at the destination.
5. The method of claim 4, where determining the identity of an operator at the destination further includes determining that the operator at the destination is not included in a teleconference including the selected audio stream.
6. The method of claim 1, where the pre-defined operator locations include the destination.
7. The method of claim 1, where the subset is selected based one or more corresponding destinations for the subset.
8. The method of claim 1, where the subset is selected based one or more invitations sent to identities associated with corresponding operators for the subset.
9. The method of claim 1, where the capture preferences designate capture via a directed transducer array for at one of the multiple pre-defined operator locations.
10. The method of claim 1, where the destination include a multiple-operator location.
11. A method including: detecting an occupancy at a selected pre-defined operator location of multiple pre-defined operator locations; determining an identity associated with the occupancy; based on the identity, determining an audio profile associated with the identity; and responsive to the identity, causing playback of a mix of captured audio from a subset of the multiple pre-defined operator locations, the playback executed in accord with preferences from the audio profile.
12. The method of claim 11, where detecting the occupancy includes operating position tracking hardware disposed at the selected pre-defined operator location.
13. The method of claim 11, where casing playback of the mix responsive to the identity includes determining that an invitation to a teleconference was provided to the identity.
14. A system including: network interface circuitry configured to establish communication links with audio processing circuitry at multiple pre-defined operator locations; and control circuitry configured to: determine audio profiles associated with operators at the multiple pre-defined operator locations; based on capture preferences within the audio profiles, receive multiple captured audio streams from the multiple pre-defined operator locations via the network interface circuitry; determine to generate a mix from a subset of the captured audio streams; and cause, via the network interface circuitry, playback of the mix at the destination.
15. The system of claim 14, where the subset excludes at least a selected captured audio stream of the multiple captured audio streams.
16. The system of claim 15, where control circuitry is configured to exclude the selected captured audio stream based on a destination.
17. The system of claim 16, where control circuitry is configured to exclude the selected captured audio stream is selected for exclusion based on the destination by determining an identity of an operator at the destination.
18. The system of claim 17, where control circuitry is configured to determine the identity of an operator at the destination further by determining that the operator at the destination is not included in a teleconference including the selected audio stream.
19. The system of claim 14, where the pre-defined operator locations include the destination.
20. The system of claim 14, where control circuitry is configured to select the subset is based one or more corresponding destinations for the subset.
