<title>
Inulin for preventing antibiotic resistant infection and pathogen colonization
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides for methods and compositions for the treatment and prevention of antibiotic-resistant infections or pathogen colonization in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) or in other populations at high risk for such infections.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of treating or preventing a bacterial infection, or decreasing antibiotic resistance of gastrointestinal microbiome, in a critically ill patient or an immunosuppressed patient, the method comprising administering at least 10 g/day of an inulin to the patient, wherein the critically ill patient is a patient undergoing intensive care therapy.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the critically ill patient is in an intensive care unit (ICU).
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the immunosuppressed patient is a transplant recipient.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the bacterial infection is an antibiotic-resistant infection.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the bacterial infection is a vancomycin-resistant infection.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein about 16 g/day of the inulin is administered to the patient.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein about 32 g/day of the inulin is administered to the patient.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the inulin is administered to the patient for about 3 days to about 2 weeks.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the inulin is administered to the patient for about 7 days.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the inulin is administered orally.
11. A method of treating or preventing pathogen colonization, or increasing an abundance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing bacteria, in a critically ill patient or an immunosuppressed patient, comprising administering at least 10 g/day of an inulin to the patient, wherein the critically ill patient is a patient undergoing intensive care therapy.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the critically ill patient is in an intensive care unit (ICU).
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the pathogen colonization comprises gastrointestinal pathogen colonization.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein the pathogen colonization is multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial colonization.
15. The method of claim 11, wherein the pathogen colonization comprises colonization by antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
16. The method of claim 11, wherein the pathogen colonization comprises colonization by vancomycin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (VRE), beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Gram-negative bacteria, Klebsiella pneumonia carbapenemase (KPC)-producing bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), or combinations thereof.
17. The method of claim 11, wherein the pathogen colonization comprises colonization by Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, or combinations thereof.
18. The method of claim 11, wherein the SCFA-producing bacteria comprise Clostridial Clusters IV/XIVa selected from the group consisting of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium rectale, Ruminococcus, Blautia, Coprococcus, Roseburia, or combinations thereof.
19. The method of claim 11, wherein the inulin is administered orally.
20. The method of claim 1, wherein the intensive care therapy comprises induction of homeostasis; ventilation; hemodialysis; vasopressor support; fluid support; parenteral nutrition; administration of large volumes of blood products; systemic antibiotic and/or antiviral and/or antifungal and/or antiprotozoic therapy; granulocyte infusion; T cell infusion; stem cell infusion; pulmonary artery catheter insertion; and/or arterial blood pressure catheter insertion.
