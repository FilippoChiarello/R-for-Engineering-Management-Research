<title>
Contact center system and method for advanced outbound communications to a contact group
</title>

<abstract>
A method of establishing communication across contact center systems of unaffiliated entities includes receiving a first signal from a first server of a first contact center system, the first signal being indicative of an event associated with a first entity of the unaffiliated entities, identifying a user based on an identifier embedded within the first signal, identifying one or more second entities from among the unaffiliated entities, wherein the second entities are identified as being trusted by the user, predicting impact of the event on the one or more second entities, identifying a particular entity from among the one or more second entities predicted to be impacted by the event, and generating a second signal for transmission to a second server of a second contact center system associated with the identified particular entity, the second signal including data corresponding to the user and the event.

9. The method of claim 8, further comprising: monitoring, by the processor, a second event generated by the identified particular entity, the identified particular entity being associated with the one or more second industry verticals; and updating, by the processor, a corresponding model for the identified particular industry vertical based on the second event.
10.
