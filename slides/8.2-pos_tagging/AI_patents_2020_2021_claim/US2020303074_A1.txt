INDIVIDUALIZED AND COLLABORATIVE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, METHOD AND COMPUTER PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for individualized life management focusing on individualized and collaborative health care involving a plurality of individuals, using groups of state parameters for defining a state of each individual, and using groups of action parameters for defining treatment options and/or behavior options targeted at an individual. The system includes a data processor for processing input data, based on the groups of state parameters, into output data, which are the basis for the groups of action parameters, using defined relationships/assignments between groups of state parameters and groups of action parameters. Data storage stores the groups of state parameters and action parameters and the defined relationships/assignments between groups of the state and action parameters. A data communication system/platform communicates state parameters and/or action parameters among the individuals. The data processor means can include an adaptive structure (e.g., neural networks) where the defined relationships/assignments between groups are redefined/updated using empirical pairs of action parameter groups and state parameter groups.
