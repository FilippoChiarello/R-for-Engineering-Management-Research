SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR OBJECT AND OBSTACLE DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION IN COLLISION AVOIDANCE OF RAILWAY APPLICATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
A system for detection and identification of objects and obstacles near, between or on railway comprise several forward-looking imagers adapted to cover each different range forward and preferably to be sensitive each to different wavelength of radiation, including visible light, LWIR, and SWIR. The substantially homogeneous temperature along the rail the image of which is included in an imager frame assists in identifying and distinguishing the rail from the background. Image processing is applied to define living creature in the image frame and to distinguish from a man-made object based on temperature of the body. Electro optic sensors (e.g. thermal infrared imaging sensor and visible band imaging sensor) are used to survey and monitor railway scenes in real time.
