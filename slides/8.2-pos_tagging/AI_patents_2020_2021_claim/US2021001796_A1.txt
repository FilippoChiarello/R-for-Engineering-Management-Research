PHYSIQUE ESTIMATION DEVICE AND PHYSIQUE ESTIMATION METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A physique estimation device determines a seat on which an occupant is seated on the basis of face information of the occupant detected from an image capturing a vehicle compartment, calculates the occupant's sitting height using a difference between a reference position and a face position for the determined seat, and estimates the occupant's physique on the basis of the occupant's sitting height.

<claims>
1. A physique estimation device comprising: processing circuitry to receive input of an image capturing a vehicle compartment and detect face information of an occupant from the input image; and to estimate the occupant's physique by determining a seat on which the occupant is seated on a basis of the face information detected, calculating the occupant's sitting height using a difference between a reference position and a face position for the determined seat, and estimating the occupant's physique on a basis of the calculated occupant's sitting height, wherein the processing circuitry determines the seat on which the occupant is seated on a basis of the face position and a face size of the occupant that are detected from the image capturing the vehicle compartment, and converts the difference between the reference position and the face position into the occupant's sitting height using a conversion value.
2. A physique estimation device comprising: processing circuitry to receive input of an image capturing a vehicle compartment and detect face information of an occupant from the input image; to estimate the occupant's physique by determining a seat on which the occupant is seated on a basis of the face information detected, calculating the occupant's sitting height using a difference between a reference position and a face position for the determined seat, and estimating the occupant's physique on a basis of the calculated occupant's sitting height; and to receive input of the image capturing the vehicle compartment and detect child seat information from the input image, wherein the processing circuitry identifies an occupant seated on a child seat on a basis of the child seat information detected, and estimates that a physique of the identified occupant is a physique classified as that of a child.
3. The physique estimation device according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry receives input of the image capturing the vehicle compartment, and detects shoulder information of the occupant from the input image, and the processing circuitry calculates a shoulder width of the occupant on a basis of the shoulder information detected, and estimates the occupant's physique on a basis of the calculated shoulder width and the sitting height of the occupant.
4. The physique estimation device according to claim 3, wherein the processing circuitry estimates the occupant's physique from the shoulder width and the sitting height of the occupant by referring to correspondence data between anthropometric data including sitting heights and shoulder widths and human physiques.
5. The physique estimation device according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry determines the seat on which the occupant is seated on a basis of the face information detected by referring to data indicating face position ranges corresponding to respective slide positions or reclining positions of the seat and face size ranges corresponding to the respective slide positions or reclining positions, and calculates the occupant's sitting height using the conversion value and the reference position that correspond to a slide position or a reclining position.
6. A physique estimation method comprising: receiving input of an image capturing a vehicle compartment and detecting a face position and a face size of an occupant from the input image; and estimating the occupant's physique by determining a seat on which the occupant is seated on a basis of the face position and the face size detected, calculating the occupant's sitting height by converting a difference between a reference position and a face position for the determined seat into the occupant's sitting height using a conversion value, and estimating the occupant's physique on a basis of the calculated occupant's sitting height.
7. A physique estimation method comprising: receiving input of an image capturing a vehicle compartment and detecting face information of an occupant from the input image; estimating the occupant's physique by determining a seat on which the occupant is seated on a basis of the face information detected, calculating the occupant's sitting height using a difference between a reference position and a face position for the determined seat, and estimating the occupant's physique on a basis of the calculated occupant's sitting height; receiving input of the image capturing the vehicle compartment and detecting child seat information from the input image; and identifying an occupant seated on a child seat on a basis of the child seat information detected and estimating that a physique of the identified occupant is a physique classified as that of a child.
