ELECTRONIC DEVICE AND FEEDBACK INFORMATION ACQUISITION METHOD THEREFOR
</title>

<abstract>
Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate to an electronic device and a feedback information acquisition method therefor. The feedback information acquisition method of the electronic device includes: acquiring input feedback information of a user and first response information of the user, which are related to a specific function; training a feedback estimation model by using the input feedback information and the first response information; acquiring second response information of the user related to the specific function; and acquiring feedback information related to the specific function by applying the second response information to the trained feedback estimation model.

<claims>
1. A feedback information acquisition method comprising: acquiring input feedback information of a user and first response information of the user, which are related to a specific function; training a feedback estimation model by using the input feedback information and the first response information; acquiring second response information of the user related to the specific function; and acquiring feedback information related to the specific function by applying the second response information to the trained feedback estimation model.
2. The feedback information acquisition method of claim 1, further comprising transmitting the feedback information related to the specific function to a function estimation apparatus configured to acquire function information about a function to be executed by using command information of the user.
3. The feedback information acquisition method of claim 2, wherein the function estimation apparatus is configured to train a function estimation model by using the feedback information related to the specific function.
4. The feedback information acquisition method of claim 1, wherein the first response information and the second response information are information based on at least one of facial information of the user and voice information of the user, which are related to the specific function.
5. The feedback information acquisition method of claim 4, wherein the facial information comprises facial expression information of the user related to the specific function.
6. The feedback information acquisition method of claim 1, wherein the input feedback information, the first response information, and the second response information correspond to input feedback information of the user, first response information of the user, and second response information of the user, which are related to a specific function provided by an external user terminal communicatively connected, respectively.
7. The feedback information acquisition method of claim 1, wherein the input feedback information of the user comprises execution success information corresponding to selection information of a user who has selected an execution continuation user interface (UI) with respect to the specific function or execution failure information corresponding to selection information of a user who has selected an execution cancellation UI with respect to the specific function.
8. The feedback information acquisition method of claim 1, wherein the feedback information related to the specific function comprises execution success information or execution failure information in which a users feedback is estimated for the specific function.
9. The feedback information acquisition method of claim 1, wherein the first response information and the second response information are information acquired during execution of the specific function, acquired during preparation of the specific function, or acquired while the user inputs feedback.
10. The feedback information acquisition method of claim 1, wherein the trained feedback estimation model is a model configured to provide feedback information as estimation data, which is a result of estimating a user's feedback, by using response information as recognition data.
11. An electronic device comprising: a memory configured to store a feedback estimation model; a communicator configured to communicate with an external device; and a processor electrically connected to the memory and the communicator, wherein the processor is configured to: train the feedback estimation model stored in the memory by using input feedback information of a user and first response information of the user, which are related to a specific function, the input feedback information and the first response information being acquired through the communicator; and when second response information of the user, related to the specific function, is acquired through the communicator, acquire feedback information related to the specific function by applying the second response information to the trained feedback estimation model.
12. The electronic device of claim 11, wherein the processor is further configured to control the communicator to transmit the feedback information related to the specific function to a function estimation apparatus configured to acquire function information about a function to be executed by using command information of the user.
13. The electronic device of claim 12, wherein the function estimation apparatus is further configured to train a function estimation model by using the feedback information related to the specific function.
14. The electronic device of claim 11, wherein the first response information and the second response information are information based on at least one of facial information of the user and voice information of the user, which are related to the specific function.
15. A computer program product comprising a recording medium having stored therein a program for performing: acquiring input feedback information of a user and first response information of the user, which are related to a specific function; training a feedback estimation model by using the input feedback information and the first response information; acquiring second response information of the user related to the specific function; and acquiring feedback information related to the specific function by applying the second response information to the trained feedback estimation model.
