<title>
WIRELESS NETWORK OPTIMIZATION
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and apparatuses are provided for optimizing a wireless network. A description of a traffic incident is received. An impact area is generated from the description. A geographic polygon is generated based on the impact area. The network usage of the geographic polygon is determined. A message including the network usage for the geographic polygon may be transmitted to a mobile network operator.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method comprising: receiving a description of a traffic incident; predicting an estimated traffic flow pattern for a first time period as a result of the traffic incident based on the description, current traffic flow, and historical traffic flow; determining an impact area of the traffic incident based on the estimated traffic flow pattern; estimating a future level of network data congestion for the impact area as a result of the estimated traffic flow pattern; identifying one or more cells of a cellular network associated with the future level of network data congestion; and transmitting a message to one or more devices predicted to traverse the one or more cells of the cellular network.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: generating a load balancing scheme that shifts downloads or transmission of data to different cells other than the one or more cells of the cellular network associated with the future level of network data congestion.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the message comprises a request to the one or more devices to download map data from a cell of the cellular network that is not affected by an increase in the future level of network data congestion.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: preemptively transmitting data to the one or more devices prior to the one or more devices entering the one or more cells of the cellular network.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: preemptively buffering transportation related data to the one or more devices prior to the one or more devices entering the one or more cells of the cellular network.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein predicting the estimated traffic flow pattern further uses one or more current weather conditions.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein estimating the future level of network data congestion comprises: identifying a historical number of connected devices in the impact area; and calculating a predicted number of connected devices in the impact area based on the estimated traffic flow pattern.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein estimating the future level of network data congestion further comprises: identifying, from one or more device profiles of the predicted number of connected devices, an estimated bandwidth of the predicted number of connected devices.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying the one or more cells comprises: generating a geographic polygon based on the impact area; overlaying the geographic polygon on a cellular map; and identifying the one or more cells from an overlap of the geographic polygon and the cellular map.
10. An apparatus comprising: at least one processor; and at least one memory including computer program code for one or more programs; the at least one memory configured to store the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to: receive a description of a traffic incident; predict an estimated traffic flow pattern for a time period for an impact area as a result of the traffic incident based on the description, current traffic flow, and historical traffic flow; estimate a future level of network data congestion as a result of the estimated traffic flow pattern; identify one or more cells of a cellular network associated with the future level of network data congestion; and transmit a message to one or more devices predicted to traverse the one or more cells of the cellular network.
11. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the message comprises a request to the one or more devices to download map data from a cell of the cellular network that is not affected by an increase in the future level of network data congestion.
12. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein predicting the estimated traffic flow pattern is further based on one or more current weather conditions.
13. The apparatus of claim 10, wherein the computer program code is configured to estimate the future level of network data congestion by causing the processor to: identify a historical number of connected devices in the impact area; and calculate a predicted number of connected devices in the impact area based on the estimated traffic flow pattern.
14. The apparatus of claim 13, wherein the computer program code further comprises: identifying, from one or more device profiles of the predicted number of connected devices, an estimated bandwidth of the predicted number of connected devices.
15. A system for optimizing a wireless network, the system comprising: a receiver configured to receive a description of a traffic incident; a processor configured to predict an estimated traffic flow pattern for a time period as a result of the traffic incident based on the description, current traffic flow data, and historical traffic flow data, determine an impact area based on the estimated traffic flow pattern, estimate a future level of network data congestion for the impact area as a result of the estimated traffic flow pattern, and identify one or more cells of a cellular network associated with the future level of network data congestion; and a transmitter configured to transmit a message to one or more devices predicted to traverse the one or more cells.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the message comprises a request to the one or more devices to download map data from a cell of the cellular network that is not affected by an increase in the future level of network data congestion.
17. The system of claim 15, wherein the processor is configured to predict the estimated traffic flow pattern based on one or more current weather conditions.
18. The system of claim 15, wherein the processor is configured to estimate the future level of network data congestion by identifying a historical number of connected devices in the impact area and calculating a predicted number of connected devices in the impact area based on the estimated traffic flow pattern.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein the processor is further configured to identify from one or more device profiles of the predicted number of connected devices, an estimated bandwidth of the predicted number of connected devices.
20. The system of claim 15, wherein the message comprises a request to the one or more devices to preemptively download data prior to entering the impact area.
