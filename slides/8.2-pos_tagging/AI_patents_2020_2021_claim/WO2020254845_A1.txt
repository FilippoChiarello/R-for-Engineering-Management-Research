SYSTEM FOR ANALYSIS AND COMPRESSION OF VIDEO RESULTS OF AN ENDOSCOPIC EXAMINATION
</title>

<abstract>
System for analysis and compression of video results of the endoscopic examination using the endoscope, auxiliary monitor, computer program and database of graphic files with the images of lesions, characterised in that the computer program indexes the frames from the large intestine endoscopic examination video recording saved as a digital file with endoscope position as a depth measured from the caecum. Next, the software selects out of the indexed images those which, in accordance with the results of the classification algorithm based on machine learning from the graphic files with images of lesions, contain the largest amount of diagnostic information. The images indexed with the endoscope position information are then compressed using the lossy compression mechanisms, and the lossy compression factor for each of those single images is variable on the surface and depends on the content of diagnostic information. Then, the images compressed in such a way are saved in the container file along with the depth resulting from the indexing information. Further in the course of the endoscopic examination, the computer program displays on the auxiliary monitor the images saved in the container file, which were obtained from the same part of the large intestine in which the endoscope is currently located, but in the previous examination of the particular patient.

<claims>
1. System for analysis and compression of video results of the endoscopic examination using the endoscope, auxiliary monitor, computer program and database of graphic files with the images of lesions, characterised in that the computer program indexes the frames from the large intestine endoscopic examination video recording saved as a digital file with endoscope position as a depth measured from the caecum. Next, the software selects out of the indexed images those which, in accordance with the results of the classification algorithm based on machine learning from the graphic files with images of lesions, contain the largest amount of diagnostic information. The images indexed with the endoscope position information are then compressed using the lossy compression mechanisms, and the lossy compression factor for each of those single images is variable on the surface and depends on the content of diagnostic information. Then, the images compressed in such a way are saved in the container file along with the depth resulting from the indexing information. Further in the course of the endoscopic examination, the computer program displays on the auxiliary monitor the images saved in the container file, which were obtained from the same part of the large intestine in which the endoscope is currently located, but in the previous examination of the particular patient.
2. System according to claim 1, characterised in that the computer program can display the results of automatic analysis of lesions, in particular polyps, on the auxiliary monitor, and the lesions are marked with a specific colour in the image on the auxiliary monitor, whereas the image displayed on the endoscope monitor and the auxiliary monitor is synchronised so that you can view the same fragments of the large intestine during the endoscopic examination.
