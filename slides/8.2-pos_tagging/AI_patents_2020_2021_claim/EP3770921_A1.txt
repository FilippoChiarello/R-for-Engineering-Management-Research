METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PRESSURE AUTOREGULATION BASED SYNTHESIZING OF PHOTOPLETHYSMOGRAM SIGNAL
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosure relates to digital twin of cardiovascular system called as cardiovascular model to generate synthetic Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal pertaining to disease conditions. The conventional methods are stochastic model capable of generating statistically equivalent PPG signals by utilizing shape parameterization and a nonstationary model of PPG signal time evolution. But these technique generates only patient specific PPG signatures and do not correlate with pathophysiological changes. Further, these techniques like most synthetic data generation techniques lack interpretability. The cardiovascular model of the present disclosure is configured to generate the plurality of synthetic PPG signals corresponding to the plurality of disease conditions. The plurality of synthetic PPG signals can be used to tune Machine Learning algorithms. Further, the plurality of synthetic PPG signals can be utilized to understand, analyze and classify cardiovascular disease progression.
