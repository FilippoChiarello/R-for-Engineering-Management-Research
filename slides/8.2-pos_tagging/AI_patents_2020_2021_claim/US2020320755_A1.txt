<title>
ESTABLISHING A THREE-DIMENSIONAL TOMOSYNTHESIS DATA RECORD
</title>

<abstract>
A method for establishing a three-dimensional tomosynthesis data record of a target volume from two-dimensional projection images recorded with a recording arrangement including an X-ray source and an X-ray detector in different recording geometries is provided. During or after a reconstruction step, a deconvolution technique is used for reducing image artifacts of the tomosynthesis data record occurring due to lacking information. The projection images are recorded along a linear recording trajectory of the X-ray source. The reconstruction and the use of the deconvolution technique take place in a plurality of different two-dimensional reconstruction planes that are spanned by the recording trajectory and, in each case, a definition point in the target volume.
