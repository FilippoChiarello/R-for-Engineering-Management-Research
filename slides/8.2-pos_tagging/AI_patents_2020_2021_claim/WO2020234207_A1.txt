MULTI-CHANNEL PILOT TONE MOTION DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a medical system (100, 300, 500, 700) comprising: a memory (128) storing machine executable instructions (130); a processor (122) configured for controlling the medical system; and a pilot tone system (106). The pilot tone system comprises a radio frequency system (108) comprising multiple transmit channels (110) and multiple receive channels (112). The multiple transmit channels are configured for each transmitting unique pilot tone (132) signals via multiple transmit coils. The multiple receive channels are configured for receiving multi-channel pilot tone data (134) via multiple receive coils. Execution of the machine executable instructions causes the processor to: transmit (200) multi-channel pilot tone signals by controlling at least a portion of the multiple transmit channels to transmit the unique pilot tone signals; acquire (202) multi-channel pilot tone data (134) by controlling at least a portion of the multiple receive channels to receive the multi- channel pilot tone data; and determine (204) a motion state (136) of the subject using the multi-channel pilot tone data.
