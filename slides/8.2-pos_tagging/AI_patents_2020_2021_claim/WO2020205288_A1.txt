BANDWIDTH USAGE REDUCTION EMPLOYING MEDIA TREADING WITH REDUCTIVE EDGING
</title>

<abstract>
A method system and computer program product for bandwidth usage reduction in media streaming, comprises, receiving user streaming information from a client device and refining a user model with the user streaming information. The user streaming information reflects a user's media consumption habits. Subsequently a request for a media playlist from the client device is received and media segments are prospectively requested based on the user model before receiving a request for the media segments. The requested media playlist is sent to the client device; and the prospectively requested media segments are sent upon receiving a request for a media segment from the client device.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for bandwidth usage reduction in media streaming, comprising:
receiving user streaming information from a client device, wherein the user streaming information reflects a user's media consumption habits;
refining a user model with the user streaming information;
receiving a request for a media playlist from the client device;
prospectively requesting a media segment based on the user model before receiving a request for the media segments;
sending the requested media playlist to the client device; and
sending the prospectively requested media segments upon receiving a request for a media segment from the client device.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein receiving user streaming information includes at least requests for media segments from the client device and determining the time between requests for media segments and the time length of each media segment.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein receiving user streaming information also includes media information.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein receiving user streaming information includes the play head position for the media playing on the client device.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein refining a user mode with the user streaming information includes at least changing a threshold level for segments in a cache based on the user streaming information.
6. The method of claim 2 wherein the user model changes based on the media information.
7. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein refining a user model includes training a neural network using a machine learning algorithm.
8. A system for bandwidth usage reduction in media streaming comprising:
a processor;
memory coupled to the processor; non-transitory instructions in the memory that when executed cause the processor to carry out the method comprising:
receiving user streaming information from a client device, wherein the user streaming information reflects a user's media consumption habits;
refining a user model with the user streaming information;
receiving a request for a media playlist from the client device;
prospectively requesting a media segment based on the user model before receiving a request for the media segments;
sending the requested media playlist to the client device; and
sending the prospectively requested media segments upon receiving a request for a media segment from the client device.
9. The system of claim 8 wherein receiving user streaming information includes at least requests for media segments from the client device and determining the time between requests for media segments and the time length of each media segment.
10. The system of claim 9 wherein receiving user streaming information also includes media information.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein receiving user streaming information includes the play head position for the media playing on the client device.
12. The system of claim 8 wherein refining a user mode with the user streaming information includes at least changing a threshold level for segments in a cache based on the user streaming information.
13. The system of claim 9 wherein the user model changes based on the media information.
14. The system of claim 8 wherein refining a user model includes training a neural network using a machine learning algorithm.
15. Non-transitory instructions embedded in a computer readable medium that cause a
computer to carry out the method comprising:
receiving user streaming information from a client device, wherein the user streaming information reflects a user's media consumption habits;
refining a user model with the user streaming information; receiving a request for a media playlist from the client device;
prospectively requesting a media segment based on the user model before receiving a request for the media segments;
sending the requested media playlist to the client device; and
sending the prospectively requested media segments upon receiving a request for a media segment from the client device. 16. The non-transitory instructions of claim 15 wherein receiving user streaming information includes at least requests for media segments from the client device and determining the time between requests for media segments and the time length of each media segment. 17. The non-transitory instructions of claim 16 wherein receiving user streaming information also includes media information. 18. The non-transitory instructions of claim 15, wherein receiving user streaming information includes the play head position for the media playing on the client device. 19. The non-transitory instructions of claim 15 wherein refining a user mode with the user streaming information includes at least changing a threshold level for segments in a cache based on the user streaming information. 20. The non-transitory instructions of claim 16 wherein the user model changes based on the media information.
