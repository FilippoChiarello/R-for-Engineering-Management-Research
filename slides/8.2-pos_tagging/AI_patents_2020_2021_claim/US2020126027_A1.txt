<title>
Intelligent Disposition of Returned Assets
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments are directed to systems, methods and computer program products for dispositioning returned assets. Embodiments determine, for each asset, the optimal disposition, prepare the asset for its final disposition, label it, and direct it to the appropriate landing bucket. Some embodiments receive an asset, connect it to a hub where it may be activated and received into a warehouse. The asset may require diagnostics to determine operational/functional and cosmetic status and/or other services to prepare it for final disposition. Data may be collected from the asset, the receiving process and a database containing information related to the asset item number and the record for the specific asset. An asset profile is created to which business rules are applied which may determine a preliminary disposition for the asset. Profiles for assets passing preliminarily dispositioning are processed through an optimal value server. The optimal value server determines the optimal disposition of an item based on demand and cost. Items are labeled for final disposition and directed to the appropriate bucket or bin for shipping.

<claims>
1. A system, comprising: a disposition engine comprising at least a processor, a memory, and computer-executable instructions stored in memory which when executed by the processor cause the processor to: receive data describing an item of a product wherein the data is comprised of at least product attributes, item number, item identifier, item device status and condition, and transactional data associated with an item; create an item profile from the received data; apply rules to the item profile to determine a first disposition of the item, which may be an intermediate or a final disposition of the item, where rules comprise business and operational requirements; an optimal disposition server comprising at least a processor, a memory, and computer-executable instructions stored in memory which when executed by the processor cause the processor to: receive the item profile of an item which has not yet been assigned a final disposition; receive forecast demand and pricing data for secondary markets; receive business rules, vendor availability, cost and capacity data for secondary processing; determine, in real-time, the optimal final disposition of an item by balancing cost, pricing, demand and business rules; assign the optimal disposition to the item, label the item with item-specific data and disposition; and convey the item to its final disposition location. (assign could possibly be the end of the independent claim)
2. The system of claim 1 further comprising: a machine learning server comprising at least a processor, a memory, and computer-executable instructions stored in memory which when executed by the processor cause the processor to: receive data related to at least one of (i) demand forecast for an item, (ii) market pricing for an item, or (iii) parts availability for an item from a plurality of data sources; train a set of predictive models for determining at least one of (i) demand forecast for an item, (ii) pricing forecast for an item, or (iii) parts availability for items requiring repair; communicate model results to the optimal disposition server wherein the optimal disposition server uses the results as input to calculate the optimal disposition of an item.
3. The system of claim 2 wherein the machine learning models are of the type Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines.
4. The system of claim 2 wherein the data received comprises data related to auctions in various markets including global markets.
5. The system of claim 1 further comprising: a cosmetic grading machine, comprising: a processor; a memory; an automated object controller operatively configured to hold and move an item; a camera for creating images of the item from a plurality of views in order to detect defects; a lighting mount with lights wherein the lights are configured to blah blah a laser sensor and sensor controller, wherein the sensor controller is further comprised of a processor and memory and computer-executable instructions which when executed by the processor cause it to receive input and perform output; and an image processing module comprising computer-executable instructions which when executed by the processor cause the processor to perform image analysis and determine coordinates of defects and to communicate the coordinates to the sensor controller instructing the sensor to locate defects, create images and measure the defect and return a cosmetic grade for the item being analyzed.
6. The system of claim 5 wherein a trained machine learning algorithm is used to detect defects in the images and to estimate depth based on light intensity.
7. A method for intelligent disposition of returned assets, the method comprising: determining, by a computing device processor, inventory and transactional item attributes of an item; determining, by a computer device processor, the operational and functional status of the item; determining, by a computerized device processor, the cosmetic status of the item, wherein the computerized device processor includes an imdage processing module and sensor capable of locating defects and measuring the three-dimensional aspects of each defect and assigning a grade to the item; creating a data record for the item by a computer device processor, the data record comprising at least the inventory item attributes of the item, the operational and functional status of the item, and the cosmetic status of the item; applying business rule logic to the data record by a computer device processor, to determine disposition for the item where the disposition may be a first or a final disposition; determining, by a computer device processor and a machine learning server, forecast item demand and pricing for secondary markets; determining, by computer device processor and communication vendor availability and capacity and cost to reach eligibility for optimal disposition; determining available dispositional classifications for items, by a computer device processor, wherein available classifications are based on the data record and vendor availability and capacity and cost and forecast demand for the item; determining the optimal dispositional classification for each item, wherein the available dispositional path and vendor of greatest value is chosen; and labeling and directing the item to the appropriate bin for shipping.
