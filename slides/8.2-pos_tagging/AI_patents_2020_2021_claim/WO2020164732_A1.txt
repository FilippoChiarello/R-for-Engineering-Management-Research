A METHOD FOR COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED SIMULATION OF SENSOR DATA OF A VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
The invention refers to a method for computer-implemented simulation of sensor data of a vehicle (VE), comprising the steps of: i) providing simulation parameters (SP1, SP2) in the form of a digital description (DES) of a 3D scene (SC) in the surrounding area of the vehicle (VE), the 3D scene (SC) comprising a number of objects (OB) in the surrounding area, where at least a part of the simulation parameters (SP1, SP2) are first simulation parameters (SP1), the first simulation parameters (SP1) being derived by semantic parsing (SPA) of a natural language text (TX); ii) simulating outputs (OU1, OU2, OU3) of a number of sensors (SE1, SE2, SE3) of the vehicle (VE) for a plurality of successive time points based on the simulation parameters (SP1, SP2).
