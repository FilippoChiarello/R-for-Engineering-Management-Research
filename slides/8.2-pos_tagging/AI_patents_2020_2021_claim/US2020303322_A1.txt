ACTIVE CONTROL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGE WARPAGE
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and/or techniques associated with active control of electronic package warpage are provided. In one example, a system includes an electronic package and an integrated circuit. The electronic package includes a patterned structural material associated with a mechanical characteristic that changes in response to an applied condition. The integrated circuit controls the applied condition associated with the patterned structural material based on sensor data associated with a status of the electronic package.
