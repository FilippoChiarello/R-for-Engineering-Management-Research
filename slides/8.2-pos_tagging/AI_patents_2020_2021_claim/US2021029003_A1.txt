TECHNIQUES FOR UPDATING KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS FOR CORRELATING SERVICE EVENTS IN COMPUTER NETWORK DIAGNOSTICS
</title>

<abstract>
Examples described herein generally relate to managing a knowledge graph by providing, to an agent and based on a request from the agent, an output of a number of signals having an indicated correlation in a knowledge graph, receiving, from the agent, additional correlation information for at least a portion of the number of signals and/or additional signals, and storing, in the knowledge graph, the additional correlation information.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for managing a knowledge graph, comprising: providing, to an agent and based on a request from the agent, an output of a number of signals having an indicated correlation in a knowledge graph; receiving, from the agent, additional correlation information for at least a portion of the number of signals and/or additional signals; and storing, in the knowledge graph, the additional correlation information.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising determining to correlate the portion of the number of signals and/or the additional signals based at least in part on the additional correlation information.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising providing, to a second agent and based on a second request from the second agent, a second output of at least the portion of the number of signals and/or the additional signals based on the additional correlation information.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving, from the second agent, further additional correlation information for another portion of at least the portion of the number of signals, the additional signals, and/or further additional signals; and storing, in the knowledge graph, the further additional correlation information.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the agent includes a frequency agent that obtains the number of signals based on the indicated correlation being a number of times the number of signals are viewed within a period of time.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the agent includes an anomaly agent that obtains the number of signals based on the indicated correlation being an detected anomaly among the number of signals.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 6, wherein the agent includes a causation agent that obtains the number of signals based on the indicated correlation being a pattern detected between the detected anomaly and the number of times the number of signals are viewed within the period of time.
8. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising updating the knowledge graph based at least in part on user feedback received regarding the additional correlation information.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the knowledge graph is a layer in a multiple-layer relational graph used to determine correlated service events, wherein the multiple-layer relational graph includes a configuration layer defining configured relationships between services or service events, an observation layer defining observed relationships between services or service events, and learned layer defining algorithmically-determined relationships between services or service events.
10. A computing device for managing a knowledge graph, comprising: a memory storing one or more parameters or instructions for identifying related signals from a service event repository; and at least one processor coupled to the memory, wherein the at least one processor is configured to: provide, to an agent and based on a request from the agent, an output of a number of signals having an indicated correlation in a knowledge graph; receive, from the agent, additional correlation information for at least a portion of the number of signals and/or additional signals; and store, in the knowledge graph, the additional correlation information.
11. The computing device of claim 10, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to determine to correlate the portion of the number of signals and/or the additional signals based at least in part on the additional correlation information.
12. The computing device of claim 10, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to provide, to a second agent and based on a second request from the second agent, a second output of at least the portion of the number of signals and/or the additional signals based on the additional correlation information.
13. The computing device of claim 10, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to: receive, from the second agent, further additional correlation information for another portion of at least the portion of the number of signals, the additional signals, and/or further additional signals; and store, in the knowledge graph, the further additional correlation information.
14. The computing device of claim 10, wherein the agent includes a frequency agent that obtains the number of signals based on the indicated correlation being a number of times the number of signals are viewed within a period of time.
15. The computing device of claim 10, wherein the agent includes an anomaly agent that obtains the number of signals based on the indicated correlation being an detected anomaly among the number of signals.
16. The computing device of claim 15, wherein the agent includes a causation agent that obtains the number of signals based on the indicated correlation being a pattern detected between the detected anomaly and the number of times the number of signals are viewed within the period of time.
17. The computing device of claim 10, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to update the knowledge graph based at least in part on user feedback received regarding the additional correlation information.
18. The computing device of claim 10, wherein the knowledge graph is a layer in a multiple-layer relational graph used to determine correlated service events, wherein the multiple-layer relational graph includes a configuration layer defining configured relationships between services or service events, an observation layer defining observed relationships between services or service events, and learned layer defining algorithmically-determined relationships between services or service events.
19. A non-transitory computer-readable medium, comprising code executable by one or more processors for managing a knowledge graph, the code comprising code for: providing, to an agent and based on a request from the agent, an output of a number of signals having an indicated correlation in a knowledge graph; receiving, from the agent, additional correlation information for at least a portion of the number of signals and/or additional signals; and storing, in the knowledge graph, the additional correlation information.
20. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 19, further comprising code for determining to correlate the portion of the number of signals and/or the additional signals based at least in part on the additional correlation information.
