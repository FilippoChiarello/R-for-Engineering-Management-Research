SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR REMOVING NOISE AND/OR ARTIFACTS FROM AN OCT IMAGE USING A GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods, and computer program products are provided for removing noise and/or artifacts from an image. The method includes training a generative adversarial network (GAN) based on a plurality of images, the plurality of images comprising at least one undesired element comprising at least one of the following: noise, speckle patterns, artifacts, or any combination thereof, and generating a modified image based on processing an image of an eye or other object with the GAN to remove the at least one undesired element from the image that is above an outer surface of the eye or other object.

<claims>
1. A method for removing noise and/or artifacts from an image, comprising:
training a generative adversarial network (GAN) based on a plurality of images, the plurality of images comprising at least one undesired element comprising at least one of the following: noise, speckle patterns, artifacts, or any combination thereof; and
generating a modified image based on processing an image of an eye or other object with the GAN to remove the at least one undesired element from the image that is above an outer surface of the eye or other object.
2. The method of claim 1 , wherein generating the modified image comprises identifying a plurality of background pixels corresponding to the at least one undesired element.
3. The method of claim 1 , wherein the GAN is configured to assign different weights to foreground pixels and background pixels.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the background pixels are weighed more than the foreground pixels.
5. The method of claim 1 , wherein the plurality of images comprises a plurality of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the plurality of OCT images is from a plurality of different OCT imaging systems.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein the outer surface comprises a shallowest tissue interface of the eye.
8. The method of claim 1 , wherein the modified image comprises a pre-segmented image.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising processing the presegmented image with at least one segmentation algorithm.
10. A system for removing noise and/or artifacts from an image, comprising a computing device programmed or configured to:
train a generative adversarial network (GAN) based on a plurality of images, the plurality of images comprising at least one undesired element comprising at least one of the following: noise, speckle patterns, artifacts, or any combination thereof; and
generate a modified image based on processing an image of an eye or other object with the GAN to remove the at least one undesired element from the image that is above an outer surface of the eye or other object.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein generating the modified image comprises identifying a plurality of background pixels corresponding to the at least one undesired element.
12. The system of claim 10, wherein the GAN is configured to assign different weights to foreground pixels and background pixels.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the background pixels are weighed more than the foreground pixels.
14. The system of claim 10, wherein the plurality of images comprises a plurality of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the plurality of OCT images is from a plurality of different OCT imaging systems.
16. The system of ciaim 14, wherein the outer surface comprises a shallowest tissue interface of the eye.
17. The system of claim 10, wherein the modified image comprises a pre-segmented image.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the computing device is further programmed or configured to process the pre-segmented image with at least one segmentation algorithm.
19. A computer program product for removing noise and/or artifacts from an image comprising a computing device programmed or configured to:
train a generative adversarial network (GAN) based on a plurality of images, the plurality of images comprising at least one undesired element comprising at least one of the following: noise, speckle patterns, artifacts, or any combination thereof; and
generate a modified image based on processing an image of an eye or other object with the GAN to remove the at least one undesired element from the image that is above an outer surface of the eye or other object.
