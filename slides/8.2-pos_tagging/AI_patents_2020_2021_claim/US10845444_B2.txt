<title>
System and method for magnetic resonance fingerprinting using neural networks trained with sparsely sampled dictionaries
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is a system and method for estimating quantitative parameters of a subject using a magnetic resonance ("MR") system using a dictionary. The dictionary may include a plurality of signal templates that sparsely sample acquisition parameters used when acquiring data. The acquired data is compared with the dictionary using a neural network. Thus, systems and methods are provided that are more computationally efficient, and have reduced data storage requirements than traditional MRF reconstruction systems and methods.
