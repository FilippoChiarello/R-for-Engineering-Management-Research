MONITORING OF A BATTERY STATE USING ULTRASONIC SENSORS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods to measure states of charge of a battery may include an ultrasonic sensor and a control system. For example, the control system may instruct the ultrasonic sensor to emit ultrasonic waves toward a battery, and may instruct the ultrasonic sensor to receive echoes of the emitted ultrasonic waves reflected back from the battery. In addition, the control system may process data associated with the emitted waves and received echoes, including properties associated with the waves and echoes, such as a time of flight, frequency, amplitude, wavelength, phase, duration, or others. Based on the properties of the received echoes, and by comparison with expected properties, various physical, mechanical, chemical, and/or material characteristics of the battery may be determined, based on which a state of charge and/or a state of health of the battery may further be determined.
