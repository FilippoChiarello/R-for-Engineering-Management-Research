Predictive design space metrics for materials development
</title>

<abstract>
A system and a method are disclosed for predicting design space quality for materials development and manufacture. In an embodiment, a processor receives input of a material property and a design space. The processor identifies a best data point. For each respective candidate material of the design space, the processor receives, as output from a model, a respective property value. The processor determines respective property values that exceed the property value of the best data point adds them to a subset of candidate materials. The processor determines a PFIC score for candidates in the subset. The processor generates a plurality of curves, each reflecting a respective probability distribution of property values. The processor determines a CMLI score based on the plurality of respective curves. The processor determines that the design space is high quality based on the PFIC and CMLI scores, and outputs a recommendation to proceed.
