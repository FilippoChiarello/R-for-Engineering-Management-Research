<title>
TRAJECTORY GENERATION
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for generating trajectories (310) and drivable areas for navigating a vehicle (102) in an environment are discussed herein. The techniques can include receiving a reference trajectory (304) representing an initial trajectory for a vehicle (102), such as an autonomous vehicle, to traverse the environment. Portions of the reference trajectory can be identified as corresponding to actions to navigate around a double-parked vehicle or to change lanes, for example. In some cases, a portion of the reference trajectory can be identified based on a proximity to an object (302) in the environment. A weight (316, 318) can be associated with the portions of the reference trajectory (304), and the techniques can include evaluating a reference cost function at points (306, 308, 324) of the reference trajectory (304) based on the associated weights (316, 318) to generate a target trajectory (310). Further, the techniques can include controlling the autonomous vehicle (102) to traverse the environment based at least in part on the target trajectory (310).

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A system comprising:
one or more processors; and
one or more computer-readable media storing instructions executable by the one or more processors, wherein the instructions, when executed, cause the system to perform operations comprising:
receiving a reference trajectory representing an initial path for an autonomous vehicle to traverse an environment;
determining a first weight associated with a first reference cost to be evaluated at a first point associated with a first portion of the reference trajectory, wherein the first reference cost is associated with a first difference between the first point on the reference trajectory and a corresponding first point;
determining a second weight associated with a second reference cost to be evaluated at a second point associated with a second portion of the reference trajectory, wherein the second reference cost is associated with a second difference between the second point on the reference trajectory and a corresponding second point, wherein the second weight is larger than the first weight;
evaluating a reference cost function at the first point and the second point to generate a target trajectory comprising the corresponding first point and the corresponding second point; and
controlling the autonomous vehicle to traverse the environment based at least in part on the target trajectory.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the first portion of the reference trajectory is associated with at least one of a discontinuity in the reference trajectory or an obstacle cost that meets or exceeds a threshold obstacle cost.
3. The system of any one of claims 1 or 2, wherein the first difference comprises one or more of a difference in a yaw, a lateral offset, a velocity, an acceleration, a curvature, or a curvature rate.
4. The system of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the first weight is based at least in part on one or more of:
determining that a lateral displacement associated with a portion of the target trajectory corresponding to the first portion of the reference trajectory is below a first threshold distance for a given a time period; or
determining that the lateral displacement associated with the portion of the target trajectory corresponding to the first portion of the reference trajectory is below a second threshold distance for a given distance.
5. The system of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the first reference cost comprises a penalty associated with generating the target trajectory that deviates, at the first point and represented as the first difference, from the reference trajectory.
