<title>
SINGING VOICE SEPARATION WITH DEEP U-NET CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS
</title>

<abstract>
A system, method and computer product for estimating a component of a provided audio signal. The method comprises converting the provided audio signal to an image, processing the image with a neural network trained to estimate one of vocal content and instrumental content, and storing a spectral mask output from the neural network as a result of the image being processed by the neural network. The neural network is a U-Net. The method also comprises providing the spectral mask to a client media playback device, which applies the spectral mask to a spectrogram of the provided audio signal, to provide a masked spectrogram. The media playback device also transforms the masked spectrogram to an audio signal, and plays back that audio signal via an output user interface.
