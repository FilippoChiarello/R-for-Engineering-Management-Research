<title>
OPTIMIZING AUTOMATED MODELING ALGORITHMS FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND GENERATION OF EXPLANATORY DATA
</title>

<abstract>
Certain aspects involve optimizing neural networks or other models for assessing risks and generating explanatory data regarding predictor variables used in the model. In one example, a system identifies predictor variables. The system generates a neural network for determining a relationship between each predictor variable and a risk indicator. The system performs a factor analysis on the predictor variables to determine common factors. The system iteratively adjusts the neural network so that (i) a monotonic relationship exists between each common factor and the risk indicator and (ii) a respective variance inflation factor for each common factor is sufficiently low. Each variance inflation factor indicates multicollinearity among the common factors. The adjusted neural network can be used to generate explanatory indicating relationships between (i) changes in the risk indicator and (ii) changes in at least some common factors.
