SECURE DATA PARSER METHOD AND SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A secure data parser is provided that may be integrated into any suitable system for securely storing and communicating data. The secure data parser parses data and then splits the data into multiple portions that are stored or communicated distinctly. Encryption of the original data, the portions of data, or both may be employed for additional security. The secure data parser may be used to protect data in motion by splitting original data into portions of data, that may be communicated using multiple communications paths.

<claims>
1. (canceled)
2. A method for securing data, the method comprising: receiving a first key from a storage system; generating a plurality of data chunks based on a data set, wherein each data chunk of the plurality of data chunks comprises less than an entirety of data of the data set, and wherein the data set can be reconstructed using at least a minimum number of the plurality of chunks; encrypting each respective data chunk of the plurality of data chunks with a respective second key, wherein each of the respective second keys are distinct from each other; performing a cryptographic operation based on the first key to further secure the plurality of data chunks; and storing at least one data chunk of the plurality of data chunks with data indicative of at least one of the distinct encryption keys on at least one storage device.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: storing with each data chunk of the plurality of data chunks data indicative of at least one of the distinct encryption keys.
4. The method of claim 2, further comprising: storing with each data chunk of the plurality of data chunks data indicative of a distinct encryption key used to encrypt that data chunk.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein generating the plurality of data chunks comprises using a random technique or pseudorandom technique.
6. The method of claim 2, wherein each chunk of the plurality of chunk comprises a substantially random distribution of a subset of the data set.
7. The method of claim 2, wherein generating the plurality of data chunks comprises: generating a split encryption key based on the external key; and distributing the data set based on the split encryption key.
8. The method of claim 2, further comprising encrypting each of the chunks of the plurality of chunks with the external key.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the data set is recoverable using at least a minimum number of the plurality of data chunks and the external key.
10. The method of claim 2, wherein the external key is an AES key.
11. The method of claim 2, wherein the external key is a DES key.
12. A computer system for securing a data set, the system comprising: at least one hardware processor, configured to: receive a first key from a storage system, generate a plurality of data chunks based on a data set, wherein each data chunk of the plurality of data chunks comprises less than an entirety of data of the data set, and wherein the data set can be reconstructed using at least a minimum number of the plurality of chunks; encrypt each respective data chunk of the plurality of data chunks with a respective second key, wherein each of the respective second keys are distinct from each other; perform a cryptographic operation based on the first key to further secure the plurality of data chunks; and store at least one data chunk of the plurality of data chunks with data indicative of at least one of the distinct encryption keys on at least one storage device.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the at least one hardware processor is further configured to store with each data chunk of the plurality of data chunks data indicative of at least one of the distinct encryption keys.
14. The system of claim 12, wherein the at least one hardware processor is further configured to store with each data chunk of the plurality of data chunks data indicative of a distinct encryption key used to encrypt that data chunk.
15. The system of claim 12, wherein the at least one hardware processor is configured to generate the plurality of data chunks using a random technique or pseudorandom technique.
16. The system of claim 12, wherein each chunk of the plurality of chunk comprises a substantially random distribution of a subset of the data set.
17. The system of claim 12, wherein the at least one hardware processor is configured to generate the plurality of data chunks by: generating a split encryption key based on the external key; and distributing the data set based on the split encryption key.
18. The system of claim 12, wherein the at least one hardware processor is further configured to encrypt each of the chunks of the plurality of chunks with the external key.
19. The system of claim 18, wherein the data set is recoverable using at least a minimum number of the plurality of data chunks and the external key.
20. The system of claim 12, wherein the external key is an AES key.
21. The system of claim 12, wherein the external key is a DES key.
