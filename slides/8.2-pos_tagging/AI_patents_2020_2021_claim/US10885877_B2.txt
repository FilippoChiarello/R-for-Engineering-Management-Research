<abstract>
A novel semiconductor device or display system is provided. The display system includes a correction circuit having a function of correcting an image signal by utilizing artificial intelligence. Specifically, learning by an artificial neural network enables the correction circuit to correct an image signal so as to alleviate the image discontinuity. Then, by making an inference (recognition) utilizing the artificial neural network which has finished the learning, the image signal is corrected and compensation for the image discontinuity can be made. In this manner, the junction can be inconspicuous on the displayed image, improving the quality of a high-resolution image.
