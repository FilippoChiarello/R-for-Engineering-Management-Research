APPARATUS, SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR RECOGNIZING OBJECT OF VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
An object recognition apparatus of a vehicle includes a communication device receiving information of an object from the object, a camera capturing an image of the object, and a controller that recognizes the image of the object based on a deep learning network, and, when information from recognizing the image of the object is compared with the information of the object and then the comparison result is determined as a recognition error, transmits the image of the object and an error determination result to a server.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An object recognition apparatus of a vehicle comprising: a communication device configured to receive information of an object from the object; a camera configured to capture an image of the object; and a controller, wherein the controller is configured to: recognize the image of the object based on a deep learning network; and when information from recognizing the image of the object is compared with the information of the object and then the comparison result is determined as a recognition error, transmit the image of the object and an error determination result to a server.
2. The object recognition apparatus of claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to: transmit an update request of a parameter associated with the deep learning network to the server; receive an updated parameter from the server; and apply the updated parameter to the deep learning network.
3. The object recognition apparatus of claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to: recognize the object based on the deep learning network to which the updated parameter is applied.
4. The object recognition apparatus of claim 1, wherein the communication device is configured to communicate in at least one communication scheme of V2X communication, Bluetooth communication, and cellular communication.
5. The object recognition apparatus of claim 1, wherein the object includes at least one of another vehicle, infrastructure, and an electronic device, which are placed at a periphery of the vehicle.
6. The object recognition apparatus of claim 1, wherein the information of the object includes type information and location information of the object, which are received from the object.
7. The object recognition apparatus of claim 4, wherein the information from recognizing the image of the object includes type information and location information of the object determined based on the deep learning network.
8. The object recognition apparatus of claim 5, wherein the controller is configured to: determine that image recognition of the object is successful, when the object recognized based on the deep learning network is present within an arbitrary region set based on the received information of the object.
9. An object recognition system of a vehicle comprising: an object configured to transmit information of the object; a vehicle, wherein the vehicle is configured to: receive the information of the object; and compare information from recognizing an image of the object obtained from a camera based on a deep learning network with the information of the object to determine a recognition error of the object; and a server, wherein the server is configured to: update a parameter associated with the deep learning network based on the image of the object determined as the recognition error; and transmit the updated parameter to the vehicle.
10. The object recognition system of claim 9, wherein the vehicle is configured to: transmit an update request of a parameter associated with the deep learning network to the server; and receive the updated parameter from the server to apply the updated parameter to the deep learning network.
11. The object recognition system of claim 9, wherein the server is configured to: select an image, which is to be used to update the parameter, of the received image of the object; and learn the selected image to update the parameter.
12. An object recognizing method of a vehicle, the method comprising: receiving information of an object from the object; obtaining an image of the object from a camera; recognizing the image of the object based on a deep learning network; comparing information from recognizing the image of the object with the information of the object to determine an object recognition error; and transmitting the image of the object and an error determination result to a server.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the object includes at least one of another vehicle, infrastructure, and an electronic device, which are placed at a periphery of the vehicle.
14. The method of claim 12, wherein the information of the object includes type information and location information of the object.
15. The method of claim 12, wherein the object communicates in at least one manner of V2X communication, Bluetooth communication, and cellular communication.
16. The method of claim 12, wherein the information from recognizing the image of the object includes type information and location information of the object determined based on the deep learning network.
17. The method of claim 12, further comprising: determining that image recognition of the object is successful, when the object recognized based on the deep learning network is present within an arbitrary region set based on the received information of the object.
18. The method of claim 12, further comprising: after the transmitting of the image of the object and the error determination result to the server, receiving, from the server, a parameter updated in the server based on the image of the object and the error determination result.
19. The method of claim 18, further comprising: transmitting an update request of the parameter associated with the deep learning network; and receiving the updated parameter from the server to apply the updated parameter to the deep learning network.
20. The method of claim 18, further comprising: recognizing the object based on the deep learning network to which the updated parameter is applied.
