<title>
Unified control of privacy-impacting devices
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, techniques, and apparatuses facilitate selecting, defining, controlling, verifying, and auditing privacy-impacting behaviors of devices in alignment with the privacy behavior expectations of individuals and other entities. Techniques and systems, including apparatuses, are presented to facilitate controlling and verifying the privacy behaviors of privacy-impacting devices. "Privacy enunciator" apparatuses announce the presence of entities in a device's range of action or influence. Techniques and systems for defining and sharing individualized privacy behavior preferences are described. Techniques and systems are disclosed for privacy preference resolution protocols that allow for the automated or interactive resolution of conflicts that arise between individuals in multi-actor environments or ambiguous contexts. Accountability and audit mechanisms verify the control state of devices with respect to their privacy behavior preference inputs. A trust-enhancing and technically transparent system architecture includes a distributed application network, distributed ledger technology, smart contracts, and/or blockchain technology.

<claims>
1. A system for auditing a privacy trust system distributed ledger transaction comprising: a distributed application unit comprising a data storage device with instructions stored therein, and configured to access a distributed application network comprising a privacy trust system distributed ledger; program instructions stored on computer readable storage media of the system that, when executed by a processing system, direct the processing system to: obtain, via the distributed application unit, a control state verification transaction from the privacy trust system distributed ledger; extract control state verification data from the control state verification transaction; using the control state verification data, retrieve, via the distributed application unit, at least one privacy rule access token-storing transaction stored on the privacy trust system distributed ledger; instantiate a virtual privacy-controlled device (PCD) having privacy-impacting (PI) modules and instantiate an operating state of the virtual PCD indicated by the at least one privacy rule access token-storing transaction; apply a privacy-control ruleset from the at least one privacy rule access token-storing transaction to the virtual PCD to determine expected control states; compare actual control states in the control state verification data to the expected control states to determine a delta set of control states; and generate and submit an audit transaction to store an audit result of the control state verification transaction on the privacy trust system distributed ledger.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the program instructions further comprise reviewing the delta set and, if the delta set is within a tolerance threshold, return all or part of a quantity of cryptographic token posted as a stake of accuracy to a guarantor token repository, otherwise transfer all or part of the quantity of cryptographic token posted as the stake of accuracy into a receiver token repository.
