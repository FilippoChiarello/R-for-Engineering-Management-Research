SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR WATERMARKING TIME, PLACE AND IDENTITY OF EVENTS
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides systems and methods for proving an event. The system comprises a network of one or more beacon nodes and each beacon node is configured to: receive a request over the network for proving a time and location for an event, and the request comprises event data generated by a requesting entity; create a timestamp for the event using a clock of the beacon node, wherein the clock is synchronized to a trusted time source; generate a hash code for the timestamp and the event data and record the hash code to a ledger at the beacon node.
</abstract>

<claims>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method for proving an event comprising:
a) receiving, at a beacon node, a request for proving a time and location for an event, wherein the request comprises event data generated by a requesting entity;
b) creating a timestamp for the event using a clock of the beacon node, wherein the clock is synchronized to a trusted time source;
c) generating a hash code for the timestamp and the event data; and
d) recording the hash code to a ledger at the beacon node.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the trusted time source comprises a grandmaster clock receiving a GNSS or GPS time signal.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the clock is synchronized using a PTP or NTP protocol.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the beacon node is located at a fixed and known location.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the event data includes hashed data of an event
document.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the timestamp is generated at the time of receiving the request.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising generating, by the beacon node, an estimated location of the requesting entity using a machine learning algorithm trained model.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein generating the estimated location comprises: (i)
generating an estimated distance or location vector with respect to the requesting node based on a network latency and (ii) using the machine learning algorithm trained model to process the estimated distance or location vector to generate the estimated location.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the estimated distance or location vector is obtained
using a route probing method or based on the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI).
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the estimated distance or location vector is obtained
from multiple of the beacon nodes that receive the request from the requesting entity.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the request further comprises a location data about the event.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising generating a probability that the location data is correct.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the probability is generated using a machine learning algorithm trained model.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the hash code is generating by combing previously
hashed events data.
15. The method of claim 7, further comprising sending, by the beacon node, the timestamp, the estimated location and the hashed event data to the requesting entity.
16. The method of claim 15, further comprising creating, by the requesting entity, a
watermark based on the timestamp, the estimated location and the hashed event data.
17. The method of claim 1, wherein the requesting entity is configured to record a hashed value of the evet data to a hash-chain managed by the requesting entity.
18. The method of claim 1, wherein the beacon node is configured to audit another beacon node's time, location and identity.
19. A system for proving an event comprising: a network of one or more beacon nodes, wherein each beacon node is configured to: a) receive a request over the network for proving a time and location for an event, wherein the request comprises event data generated by a requesting entity;
b) create a timestamp for the event using a clock of the beacon node, wherein the clock is synchronized to a trusted time source;
c) generate a hash code for the timestamp and the event data; and
d) record the hash code to a ledger at the beacon node.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein the trusted time source comprises a grandmaster clock receiving a GNSS or GPS time signal.
21. The system of claim 19, wherein the clock is synchronized using a PTP or NTP protocol.
22. The system of claim 19, wherein the beacon node is located at a fixed and known
location.
23. The system of claim 19, wherein the event data includes hashed data of an event
document.
24. The system of claim 19, wherein the timestamp is generated at the time of receiving the request.
25. The system of claim 19, wherein the beacon node is further configured to generate an estimated location of the requesting entity using a machine learning algorithm trained model.
26. The system of claim 25, wherein the estimated location is generated by: (i) generating an estimated distance or location vector with respect to the requesting node based on a network latency and (ii) using the machine learning algorithm trained model to process the estimated distance or location vector to generate the estimated location.
27. The system of claim 26, wherein the estimated distance or location vector is obtained using a route probing method or based on the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI).
28. The system of claim 25, wherein the estimated distance or location vector is obtained from multiple of the beacon nodes that receive the request from the requesting entity.
29. The system of claim 28, wherein the beacon node is further configured to generate a probability that the location data is correct.
30. The system of claim 29, wherein the probability is generated using a machine learning algorithm trained model.
31. The system of claim 19, wherein the hash code is generating by combing previously hashed events data.
32. The system of claim 25, wherein the beacon node is further configured to send the
timestamp, the estimated location and the hashed event data to the requesting entity.
33. The system of claim 32, wherein the requesting entity is configured to create a watermark based on the timestamp, the estimated location and the hashed event data.
34. The system of claim 19, wherein the requesting entity is configured to record a hashed value of the evet data to a hash-chain managed by the requesting entity.
35. The system of claim 19, wherein at least one of the one or more beacon nodes is
configured to audit a time, location and identity for another beacon node.
