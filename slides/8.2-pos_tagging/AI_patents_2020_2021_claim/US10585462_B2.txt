<title>
System level model for pumped two-phase cooling systems
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques are provided for system level modeling of two-phase cooling systems. In one example, a computer-implemented method comprises determining, by a system operatively coupled to a processor, respective sets of steady state values for parameters at inlet-outlet junctions using a system model, wherein the determining is based on first user input specifying a cooling system design comprising a plurality of part objects, wherein adjacent part objects in a flow direction are connected at the inlet-outlet junctions. The computer-implemented method can also comprise generating, by the system, a graphical display that depicts the respective sets of parameter values at the inlet-outlet junctions.
