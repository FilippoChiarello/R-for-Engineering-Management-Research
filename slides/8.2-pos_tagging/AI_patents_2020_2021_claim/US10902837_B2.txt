Sparsity-aware adaptive feedback cancellation
</title>

<abstract>
A signal processing device comprises: input transducer(s) configured to convert input(s) to an input signal; output transducer(s) configured to convert an output signal to output(s); a signal processing circuit configured to at least subtract a feedback estimation signal from the input signal to produce a feedback compensated signal; and an adaptive feedback estimator. The adaptive feedback estimator comprises processor(s) and machine readable medium(s) collectively comprising instructions configured to cause the processor(s) to: estimate feedback path characteristic(s); construct an adaptive feedback cancellation filter based at least in part on the feedback path characteristic(s); select a value for variable p in a diversity measure norm; compute an update rule for the adaptive feedback cancellation filter, the update rule based on the diversity measure norm; apply the update rule to the adaptive feedback cancellation filter; and generate the feedback estimation signal through employment of the adaptive feedback cancellation filter on the output signal.
