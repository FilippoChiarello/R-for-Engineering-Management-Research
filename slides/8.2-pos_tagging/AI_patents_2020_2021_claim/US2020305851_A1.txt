INTRAUTERINE SAMPLE COLLECTION DEVICE AND METHOD OF USING SAME
</title>

<abstract>
A device (10) for collecting a sample from a uterus (14). The device includes a core (24) defining a core outer surface (28) and a distal brush section (30) provided with brush bristles (32) extending from the core outer surface (28). A sheath (26) receives at least part of the core (24) thereinto and defines axially opposed sheath proximal and distal ends (34 and 36). The core (24) and sheath (26) are movable relative to each other between a device retracted configuration and a device expanded configuration, wherein, in the device retracted configuration, the brush bristles (32) are compressively contained within the sheath (26) in a brush bristle compressed configuration, and, in the device expanded configuration, the brush bristles (32) are outside the sheath (26), distally to the sheath distal end (36), in a brush bristle expanded configuration wherein the brush bristles (32) span a larger volume than in brush bristle compressed configuration. Also, a kit including the device and methods of using the device.

<claims>
1. A device for collecting a biological sample from a uterus having a uterine wall delimiting a uterine cavity, the device comprising: a substantially elongated core defining a core outer surface, the core defining a distal brush section, the brush section being provided with brush bristles extending from the core outer surface; and a substantially elongated sheath receiving at least part of the core thereinto, the sheath defining axially opposed sheath proximal and distal ends; the core and sheath being movable relative to each other between a device retracted configuration and a device expanded configuration, wherein, in the device retracted configuration, the brush bristles are compressively contained within the sheath in a brush bristle compressed configuration, and, in the device expanded configuration, the brush bristles are outside the sheath, distally to the sheath distal end, in a brush bristle expanded configuration wherein the brush bristles span a larger volume than in brush bristle compressed configuration.
2. The device as defined in claim 1, wherein the brush bristles are configured and sized so that in the brush bristle expanded configuration, the brush bristles conform to a shape of at least part of the uterine cavity so that the brush bristles contact the uterine wall along a circumference thereof.
3. The device as defined in claim 1, wherein in the brush bristle expanded configuration, the brush bristles span a volume that has at least a portion thereof that tapers proximally.
4. (canceled)
5. The device as defined in claim 3, wherein in the brush bristle expanded configuration, the brush bristles span a substantially frusto-conical shape.
6. The device as defined in claim 5, wherein the frusto-conical shape has an opening angle of between about 60 degrees and about 120 degrees.
7. (canceled)
8. (canceled)
9. The device as defined in claim 1, wherein the brush bristles are configured and sized to exert a maximal shear stress of 10 Pa or less on the uterine wall in use.
10. The device as defined in claim 1, wherein the brush bristles are configured and sized to exert a maximal shear force of 1 N or less on the uterine wall in use.
11. The device as defined in claim 1, wherein, in the brush bristle expanded configuration, the brush bristles expand substantially radially outwardly from the core outer surface.
12. The device as defined in claim 1, wherein the core defines an inner passageway extending axially therealong and at least one aperture extending between the core outer surface and the inner passageway in the brush section, the inner passageway being proximally in fluid communication with a vacuum device usable to create a pressure drop in the inner passageway.
13. The device as defined in claim 12, wherein the vacuum device includes a syringe.
14. The device as defined in claim 1, wherein the sheath includes an axially collapsible section movable between collapsible section expanded and retracted configuration, wherein the sheath is shorter in the collapsible section retracted configuration than in the collapsible section expanded configuration.
15. The device as defined in claim 14, wherein the core and the sheath are both proximally mounted to a base so that in the collapsible section retracted configuration, the core and sheath are in the device expanded configuration, and in the collapsible section expanded configuration, the core and sheath are in the device retracted configuration.
16. The device as defined in claim 1, wherein the core further defines a tip section distal to the brush section, the tip section being atraumatic.
17. (canceled)
18. The device as defined in claim 16, wherein the tip section tapers in a distally leading direction.
19. The device as defined in claim 16, wherein the tip section is more flexible than the brush section.
20. The device as defined in any one of claims 1 to 19, wherein at least one of the brush bristles either tapers in a direction leading away from the core outer surface or tapers in a direction leading towards the core outer surface.
21. (canceled)
22. The device as defined in claim 1, wherein at least one of the brush bristles has a transversal cross-sectional configuration selected from the group consisting of a square, a round, a triangular, a polygonal and a ring configuration.
23. The device as defined in claim 1, wherein at least one of the brush bristles is substantially rectilinear, curved or jagged in the expanded configuration.
24. (canceled)
25. (canceled)
26. A kit including the device as defined in claim 1, a collection container and a lid, wherein the collection container contains a cell preserving fluid.
27. (canceled)
28. (canceled)
29. The kit as defined in claim 26 wherein the lid is selectively screwable to the container at a top end thereof to close the container and at a bottom end thereof to provide a base for supporting the container, the lid being wider than the container.
30. 30.-37. (canceled)
