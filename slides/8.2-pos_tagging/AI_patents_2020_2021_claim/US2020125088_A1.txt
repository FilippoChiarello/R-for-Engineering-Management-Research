CONTROL TRANSFER OF A VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
A method for detecting obstacles, the method may include receiving, from a plurality of vehicles, and by an I/O module of a computerized system, visual information acquired during executions of vehicle maneuvers that are suspected as being obstacle avoidance maneuvers; determining, based at least on the visual information, at least one visual obstacle identifier for visually identifying at least one obstacle; and transmitting to one or more of the plurality of vehicles, the at least one visual obstacle identifier.

<claims>
1. A method for finding at least one trigger for human intervention in a control of a vehicle, the method comprises: receiving, from a plurality of vehicles, and by an I/O module of a computerized system, visual information acquired during situations that are suspected as situations that require human intervention in the control of at least one of the plurality of vehicles; determining, based at least on the visual information, the at least one trigger for human intervention; and transmitting to one or more of the plurality of vehicles, the at least one trigger.
2. The method according to claim 1 wherein the determining is executed in an unsupervised manner.
3. The method according to claim 1 wherein the determining is responsive to at least one human intervention policy of the at least one vehicle.
4. The method according to claim 1 wherein the determining of the at least one trigger for human intervention comprises determining a complexity of the situation.
5. The method according to claim 1 wherein the determining of the at least one trigger for human intervention comprises determining a danger level associated with the situation.
6. The method according to claim 1 wherein the determining is responsive to statistics of maneuvers executed by different vehicles during a same situation that is suspected as a situation that requires human intervention in the control of at least one of the plurality of vehicles.
7. The method according to claim 1 comprising generating or receiving movement information of entities included in the visual information; and wherein the determining of the at least one trigger is also responsive to the movement information.
8. The method according to claim 7 wherein the movement information represents entity movement functions of the entities.
9. The method according to claim 8 comprising estimating, based on the entity movement functions, a future movement of the entities.
10. A non-transitory computer readable medium that stores instructions for: receiving, from a plurality of vehicles, and by an I/O module of a computerized system, visual information acquired during situations that are suspected as situations that require human intervention in a control of at least one of the plurality of vehicles; determining, based at least on the visual information, the at least one trigger for human intervention; and transmitting to one or more of the plurality of vehicles, the at least one trigger.
11. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 10 wherein the determining is executed in an unsupervised manner.
12. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 10 wherein the determining is responsive to at least one human intervention policy of the at least one vehicle.
13. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 10 wherein the determining of the at least one trigger for human intervention comprises determining a complexity of the situation.
14. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 10 wherein the determining of the at least one trigger for human intervention comprises determining a danger level associated with the situation.
15. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 10 wherein the determining is responsive to statistics of maneuvers executed by different vehicles during a same situation that is suspected as a situation that requires human intervention in the control of at least one of the plurality of vehicles.
16. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 10 that stores instructions for generating or receiving movement information of entities included in the visual information; and wherein the determining of the at least one trigger is also responsive to the movement information.
17. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 16 wherein the movement information represents entity movement functions of the entities.
18. The non-transitory computer readable medium according to claim 17 comprising estimating, based on the entity movement functions, a future movement of the entities.
19. A computerized system that comprises a processor and multiple units that are configured to receiving, from a plurality of vehicles, and by an I/O module of a computerized system, visual information acquired during situations that are suspected as situations that require human intervention in a control of at least one of the plurality of vehicles; determining, based at least on the visual information, the at least one trigger for human intervention; and transmitting to one or more of the plurality of vehicles, the at least one trigger.
