<title>
Method for concurrent multiuser epistemological collaboration
</title>

<abstract>
An application program, system and methods are configured to implement concurrent multiuser epistemological collaboration, that is, collaborative development of a digital knowledge model based on at least one epistemological "experience," which is stored as a structured data entity containing information that can be personally perceived (typically viewed, read, observed) by multiple concurrent users of the application over a network. The users develop the digital knowledge model, by way of GIU interactions, comprising assertion entities and belief entities based on the experience and/or selected portions of the experience defined by focus entities; wherein each set of assertion entities is related as a child of a corresponding individual experience of the set of experience entities; and each set of belief entities is related as a child of a corresponding individual assertion of the set of assertion entities.
