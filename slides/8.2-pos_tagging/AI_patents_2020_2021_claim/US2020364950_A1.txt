SELF-MAINTAINING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE PROCEDURE
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods provide for enabling an autonomous vehicle to automatically and dynamically monitor and maintain itself. The autonomous vehicle can analyze diagnostic data captured by a sensor of the autonomous vehicle in accordance with a model of autonomous vehicle operations. Based on the analysis of the diagnostic data, the autonomous vehicle can determine an operational issue and a criticality level of the operational issue based on the model of autonomous vehicle operations and, based on that determination, send the analysis of the diagnostic data to a routing service. The autonomous vehicle can receive instruction from the routing service to dynamically route the autonomous vehicle in accordance with a maintenance action.

1. A method of self-maintaining an autonomous vehicle comprising: receiving models of autonomous vehicle operations from a remote analysis service, wherein the models of autonomous vehicle operations define issues and corresponding criticality levels, wherein the issues and corresponding criticality levels are continuously updated by a fleet of autonomous vehicles as the fleet of autonomous vehicles navigates; analyzing diagnostic data captured by a sensor of the autonomous vehicle; determining an operational issue with the autonomous vehicle based on the analysis of the diagnostic data, the operational issue being one of the issues defined by the models; determining a criticality level of the operational issue based on the models of autonomous vehicle operations, the criticality level being one of the corresponding criticality levels defined by the models; based on the criticality level, sending the analysis of the diagnostic data to a routing service and receiving instruction from the routing service to dynamically route the autonomous vehicle in accordance with a maintenance action; and sending one or more portions of the diagnostic data determined to be under a particular criticality level to the remote analysis service in order to update the models of autonomous vehicle operations for the fleet of autonomous vehicles.

4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining that, based on the diagnostic data, a physical component is restricted from a threshold movement; based on the determination, classifying the operational issue with the autonomous vehicle at a first criticality level; and based on the operational issue being classified at the first criticality level, receiving instruction from the routing service to bring the autonomous vehicle to a stop.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising: determining, by the sensor, that a passenger is within the autonomous vehicle; and based on the determination, sending a request for a backup service.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining that, based on the diagnostic data, a sensor calibration value is within a threshold range that exceeds an acceptable value determined as optimal for autonomous vehicle operation; based on the determination, classifying the operational issue with the autonomous vehicle at a second criticality level; and based on the operational issue being classified at the second criticality level, receiving instruction from the routing service to dynamically drive the autonomous vehicle to a maintenance facility that can service the operational issue when a passenger within the autonomous vehicle has been dropped off.
7.
