DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR CENTRAL CONSENT REPOSITORY AND RELATED METHODS
</title>

<abstract>
A data processing central consent repository system may be configured to, for example: (1) identify a form used to collect one or more pieces of personal data, (2) determine a data asset of a plurality of data assets of the organization where input data of the form is transmitted, (3) add the data asset to the third-party data repository with an electronic link to the form, (4) in response to a user submitting the form, create a unique subject identifier to submit to the third-party data repository and, along with the form data provided by the user in the form, to the data asset, (5) submit the unique subject identifier and the form data provided by the user to the third-party data repository and the data asset, and (6) digitally store the unique subject identifier and the form data in the third-party data repository and the data asset.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented data processing method for managing a plurality of data assets of an organization with a unique subject identifier database, the method comprising: receiving, by one or more computer processors, an indication of completion of a form associated with the organization by a data subject; determining, by one or more computer processors, based at least in part on searching a unique subject identifier database, whether a unique subject identifier has been generated for the data subject; at least partially in response to determining that a unique subject identifier has not been generated for the data subject, generating, by one or more computer processors, a unique subject identifier for the data subject; storing, by one or more computer processors, the unique subject identifier for the data subject in the unique subject identifier database, wherein the unique subject identifier database electronically links a plurality of unique subject identifiers to one or more data assets that utilize form data of the form completed by the data subject; receiving, by one or more computer processors, a data subject access request from the data subject, wherein the data subject access request comprises a subject's rights request for all personal data of the data subject that has been obtained by the organization; at least partially in response to receiving the data subject access request from the data subject, accessing, by one or more computer processors, the unique subject identifier database to identify the unique subject identifier of the data subject; accessing, by one or more computer processors, a data model associated with the plurality of data assets of the organization; determining, by one or more computer processors, using the data model, one or more data assets of the plurality of data assets of the organization that are electronically linked to the unique subject identifier; accessing, by one or more computer processors, personal data of the data subject stored in each of the one or more data assets of the plurality of data assets of the organization that are electronically linked to the unique subject identifier; at least partially in response to accessing the personal data of the data subject stored in each of the one or more data assets of the plurality of data assets, automatically retrieving, by one or more computer processors, the personal data of the data subject stored in the one or more data assets; and providing, by one or more computer processors, the retrieved personal data of the data subject to the data subject.
2. The computer-implemented data processing method of claim 1, further comprising determining, by one or more computer processors, using the data model, the one or more data assets of the plurality of data assets of the organization that receive or store the form data of the form completed by the data subject.
3. The computer-implemented data processing method of claim 1, wherein the unique subject identifier for the data subject is a temporary unique subject identifier.

5. The computer-implemented data processing method of claim 1, further comprising transmitting the unique subject identifier for the data subject to a third party data repository.
6. The computer-implemented data processing method of claim 5, wherein the unique subject identifier for the data subject comprises one or more pieces of the personal data of the data subject.
7. The computer-implemented data processing method of claim 1, further comprising updating, by one or more computer processors, the unique subject identifier database to include an electronic link between the unique subject identifier for the data subject and each of (i) the form completed by the data subject, and (ii) one or more data assets that utilize the form data of the form completed by the data subject.
8. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing computer-executable instructions for managing a plurality of data assets of an organization shared with a third-party data repository by: identifying, by one or more computer processors, a form used to collect one or more pieces of personal data; determining, by one or more computer processors, one or more data assets of a plurality of data assets of the organization where input data of the form is transmitted; adding, by one or more computer processors, the one or more data assets to the third-party data repository; at least partially in response to a user submitting the form, creating, by one or more computer processors, a unique subject identifier associated with the user; transmitting, by one or more computer processors, the unique subject identifier to the third-party data repository along with the form data provided by the user in the form, to the data asset; digitally storing, by one or more computer processors, the unique subject identifier in the third-party data repository and along with the form data provided by the user in the form, in the data asset; receiving, by one or more computer processors, a data subject access request from the user, wherein the data subject access request comprises a type of data subject access request; accessing, by one or more computer processors, the third-party data repository to identify the unique subject identifier of the user; determining, by one or more computer processors, which one or more data assets of the plurality of data assets of the organization include the unique subject identifier; accessing, by one or more computer processors, personal data of the user stored in each of the one or more data assets of the plurality of data assets of the organization that include the unique subject identifier; and at least partially in response to accessing the personal data of the user stored in each of the one or more data assets of the plurality of data assets: automatically determining, by one or more computer processors, based at least on the type of data subject access request, that a first portion of personal data of the user stored in the one or more data assets is associated with fulfilling the data subject access request; in response to determining that the first portion of personal data of the user stored in the one or more data assets is associated with fulfilling the data subject access request, automatically retrieving, by the one or more processors, the first portion of personal data of the user stored in the one or more data assets; automatically determining, by the one or more processors, based at least on the type of data subject access request, that a second portion of personal data of the user stored in the one or more data assets is not associated with fulfilling the data subject access request; and at least partially in response to determining that the second portion of personal data of the user stored in the one or more data assets is not associated with fulfilling the data subject access request, automatically maintaining storage, by the one or more processors, of the second portion of personal data of the user stored in the one or more data assets; wherein the first portion of the personal data of the user stored in the one or more data assets is different from the second portion of personal data of the user stored in the one or more data assets.
