<title>
Optical camera for patient position monitoring
</title>

<abstract>
A method includes capturing a first set of optical images of the subject while a subject is lying on a table of a Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanner. This first set of optical images is acquired without any MR phased-array coils placed on the subject. While the subject continues to lie on the table of the MR scanner, a second set of optical images of the subject is acquired with the MR phased-array coils placed on the subject. Aside from the optical images, a set of MR images of the subject is acquired using the MR scanner. The first and second set of optical images are registered to the MR images. Following registration, the first and second set of optical images are used to determine element positioning of the MR phased-array coils in the set of MR images.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: while a subject is lying on a table of a Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanner, acquiring a first set of optical images of the subject without any MR phased-array coils placed on the subject; while the subject is lying on the table of the MR scanner, acquiring a second set of optical images of the subject with the MR phased-array coils placed on the subject; acquiring a set of MR images of the subject using the MR scanner; registering the first and second set of optical images to the MR images; following registration, using the first and second set of optical images to determine element positioning of the MR phased-array coils in the set of MR images.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: detecting positioning of the subject on the table using the first set of optical images, wherein placement of the MR phased-array coils on the subject is based on the positioning.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: receiving user input of a type of exam to be performed using the MR scanner, wherein the exam requires imaging of an anatomical area of interest; using the first set of optical images and anatomical model to identify a location of the anatomical area of interest with respect to the table; and generating a landmark to guide placement of the MR phased-array coils placed on the subject location of the anatomical area of interest with respect to the table.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the landmark is a laser light projected across the anatomical area of interest.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: using the element positioning of the MR phased-array coils to select a subset of the MR phased-array coils most relevant to an anatomical region of interest associated with a study being performed using the MR scanner; acquiring a new MR image of the subject covering the anatomical region of interest, wherein signals from the subset of MR phased-array coils are maximized during the acquisition while minimizing signal and noise from other MR phased-array coils.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the MR scanner is a combined MR/positron emission tomography (PET) scan and the method further comprises: acquiring emission scans of the subject covering an anatomical region of interest; and registering the emission scans to the element positioning to account for signal attenuation due to the MR phased array coils.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the set of MR images are acquired using a quick localization scan.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein a quick localization scan is performed using a FastView localizer protocol.
9. A system comprising: a Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanner comprising a table; a plurality of MR phased-array coils; an optical image camera configured to: while a subject is lying on the table of the MR scanner, capture a first set of optical images of the subject without the MR phased-array coils placed on the subject; while the subject is lying on the table of the MR scanner, capture a second set of optical images of the subject with the MR phased-array coils placed on the subject, wherein the MR scanner is configured to: capture a set of MR images of the subject using the MR scanner; register the first and second set of optical images to the MR images; following registration, use the first and second set of optical images to determine element positioning of the MR phased-array coils in the set of MR images.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the optical image camera is positioned on the MR scanner.
11. The system of claim 9, wherein the optical image camera is positioned on a ceiling above the MR scanner.
12. The system of claim 9, further comprising: detecting positioning of the subject on the table using the first set of optical images, wherein placement of the MR phased-array coils is based on the positioning.
13. The system of claim 12, further comprising: receiving user input of a type of exam to be performed using the MR scanner, wherein the exam requires imaging of an anatomical area of interest; using the first set of optical images and anatomical model to identify a location of the anatomical area of interest with respect to the table; and generating a landmark to guide placement of the MR phased-array coils placed on the subject location of the anatomical area of interest with respect to the table.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the landmark is a laser light projected across the anatomical area of interest.
15. The system of claim 9, further comprising: using the element positioning of the MR phased-array coils to select a subset of the MR phased-array coils most relevant to an anatomical region of interest associated with a study being performed using the MR scanner; acquiring a new MR image of the subject covering the anatomical region of interest, wherein signals from the subset of MR phased-array coils are maximized during the acquisition while minimizing signal and noise from other MR phased-array coils.
16. The system of claim 9, wherein the MR scanner is a combined MR/positron emission tomography (PET) scan and the system further comprises: acquiring a new PET image of the subject covering an anatomical region of interest, wherein the element positioning is used to compensate for PET signal attenuation caused by the MR phased array coils.
17. The system of claim 9, wherein the set of MR images are acquired using a quick localization scan.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein quick localization scan is performed using a FastView localizer protocol.
