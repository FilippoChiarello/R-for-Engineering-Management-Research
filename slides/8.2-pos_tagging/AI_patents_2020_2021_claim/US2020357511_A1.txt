SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR VIRTUALLY INTEGRATED CARE DELIVERY
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein are systems and methods for virtually integrated care delivery. In one implementation, a provider controller is disposed in a virtual care command center and has a provider care delivery interface. Patient controllers and provider user devices are in communication with the provider controller over a network and are each associated with a patient room and have a patient care delivery interface. The provider controller obtains real-time video from the patient controllers for presentation using the provider care delivery interface. The real-time video is captured using the patient care delivery interfaces and provides real-time surveillance of the patient rooms in the virtual care command center. A communication manager device is deployed in the network and configured to route communications among the controllers and user devices and routes a round coordination communication from the provider controller to a subset of the provider user devices associated with providers for a patient.

<claims>
1. A system for virtually integrated health care delivery, the system comprising: a healthcare portal hosted by a cloud-based platform, the healthcare portal associated with a virtual command center; a patient controller in communication with the healthcare portal over a network, the patient controller associated with a patient; a provider controller in communication with the healthcare portal over the network, the provider controller associated with a medical professional of an interprofessional team for the patient; a patient care delivery interface of the patient controller, the patient care delivery interface including a patient microphone, a patient camera, a patient speaker, and a patient display; a provider care delivery interface of the provider controller, the provider care delivery interface including a provider microphone, a provider camera, a provider speaker, and a provider display; a patient care visit session user interface presented with the patient care delivery interface of the patient controller, the patient care visit session user interface including a virtual care visit panel and a patient shared content panel; and a provider care visit session user interface presented with the provider care delivery interface of the provider controller, the provider care visit session user interface including a patient visit panel and a provider shared content panel, the virtual care visit panel providing a patient real-time view of the patient and the patient visit panel providing a provider real-time view of the medical professional during a care delivery session, the patient shared content panel and the provider shared content panel presenting shared medical content during the care delivery session.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the provider care visit session user interface includes a visit control panel providing one or more controls for controlling the care delivery session.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the one or more controls includes a mute control, a camera control, an audio control, and a share content control.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the mute control controls selective muting of audio captured by the provider microphone and the patient microphone.
5. The system of claim 3, wherein the share content control controls presentation of the shared medical content.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the patient real time view of the patient is converted into an audio exclusive connection during the care delivery session in response to a patient request.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein patient admission information is captured during the care delivery session, the patient admission information corresponding to an admission of the patient to a healthcare facility.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein at least one of the patient display or the provider display includes a touch-screen.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein patient discharge information is provided during the care delivery session, the patient discharge information corresponding to a discharge of the patient from a healthcare facility.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the provider controller communicates with a second provider controller using the healthcare portal over the network, the provider care delivery interface of provider controller and a second provider care delivery interface of the second provider controller proving a connection between the medical professional and one or more members of the interprofessional team for the patient, the connection being separate from the care delivery session.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the care delivery session is initiated following a round coordination communication being routed to the provider controller based on a match of the round coordination communication to a particular provider list of a plurality of provider lists stored in a directory, the particular provider list corresponding to the interprofessional team for the patient.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the round coordination communication is routed to an entirety of the interprofessional team.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein the round coordination communication is routed to a portion of the interprofessional team.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the round coordination communication is routed to at least a portion of the interprofessional team based on a nature of the care delivery session
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the nature of the care delivery session is determined based on a patient request.
16. The system of claim 1, wherein the shared medical content includes at least one of patient data or medical intelligence.
17. The system of claim 16, wherein the patient data includes at least one of: a patient chart, patient vitals, procedure results, patient tutorials, education content, medications prescribed, medications administered, or patient health history for the patient.
18. The system of claim 16, wherein the medical intelligence includes at least one of: patient diagnostics, patient health status, or a query response for the patient.
19. The system of claim 1, wherein at least one of patient admission information or patient discharge information is automatically generated during the care delivery session.
20. The system of claim 1, wherein an avatar is presented during the care delivery session, the avatar automatically conducting the care delivery session prior to presentation of the real-time view of the medical professional.
