<title>
PLAGIARISM RISK DETECTOR AND INTERFACE
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems and computer program products are provided for testing a lead sheet for plagiarism. A test lead sheet having a plurality of passages is received at a plagiarism detector. A set of annotations describing a level of plagiarism of a plurality of elements (e.g., chord sequence, subsequences, melodic fragments (i.e., notes), rhythm, harmony, etc.) of the test lead sheet in relation to preexisting lead sheets are generated and output via an output device.

<claims>
1. A method for testing a lead sheet for plagiarism, comprising the steps of: receiving, at a plagiarism detector, an encoded test lead sheet representing a test lead sheet having a plurality of passages; generating a set of annotations describing a level of plagiarism of a plurality of elements of the encoded test lead sheet in relation to a plurality of preexisting encoded lead sheets; and presenting via an output device, the annotations.
2. The method according to Claim 1, further comprising the steps of: displaying the test lead sheet on the output device; and displaying the set of annotations on the output device by overlaying the set of annotations over the lead sheet.
3. The method according to Claim 2, wherein displaying the set of annotations includes:
overlaying each annotation of the set of annotations over any one of (i) a corresponding melodic fragment, (ii) a chord sequence, or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii) depicted on the lead sheet.
4. The method according to any preceding claim, wherein each annotation indicates a portion of the plurality of elements and a level of plagiarism of the portion of the plurality of elements.
5. The method according to any preceding claim, further comprising the step of
training the plagiarism detector on the plurality of preexisting encoded lead sheets.
6. The method according to any preceding claim, further comprising the steps of: comparing each segment of the encoded test lead sheet to the plurality of preexisting encoded lead sheets; calculating a similarity value indicating the similarity of the segment of the encoded test lead sheet to a corresponding segment of the plurality of preexisting encoded lead sheets; and labeling as a match a segment of the encoded test lead sheet having a similarity value that meets a similarity threshold.
7. The method according to any preceding claim, further comprising the steps of: storing at least one encoded filter element; comparing the at least one encoded filter element to the plurality of preexisting encoded lead sheets; and filtering out any segments of the plurality of preexisting encoded lead sheets that match.
8. A plagiarism detector for testing a lead sheet for plagiarism, comprising:
at least one processor operable to: receive an encoded test lead sheet representing a test lead sheet having a plurality of passages; generate a set of annotations describing a level of plagiarism of a plurality of elements of the encoded test lead sheet in relation to a plurality of preexisting encoded lead sheets; and cause an output device to present the annotations.
9. The plagiarism detector according to Claim 8, the at least one processor further configured to:
cause the output device to: display the test lead sheet; and display the set of annotations by overlaying the set of annotations over the lead sheet.
10. The plagiarism detector according to Claim 9, the at least one processor further configured to cause the output device to:
overlay each annotation of the set of annotations over any one of (i) a corresponding melodic fragment, (ii) a chord sequence, or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii) depicted on the lead sheet.
11. The plagiarism detector according to any claim 8-10, wherein each annotation indicates a portion of the plurality of elements and a level of plagiarism of the portion of the plurality of elements.
12. The plagiarism detector according to any claim 8-11, the at least one processor further configured to:
test the encoded test lead sheet against a model that has been trained on the plurality of preexisting encoded lead sheets.
13. The plagiarism detector according to any claim 8-12, the at least one processor further configured to: compare each segment of the encoded test lead sheet to the plurality of preexisting encoded lead sheets; calculate a similarity value indicating the similarity of the segment of the encoded test lead sheet to a corresponding segment of the plurality of preexisting encoded lead sheets; and label as a match a segment of the encoded test lead sheet having a similarity value that meets a similarity threshold.
14. The plagiarism detector according to any claim 8-13, further comprising: a negative filter database configured to store at least one encoded filter element; and the at least one processor further configured to: compare the at least one encoded filter element to the plurality of preexisting encoded lead sheets, and filter out any segments of the plurality of preexisting encoded lead sheets that match.
15. A non-transitory computer-readable medium having stored thereon one or more sequences of instructions for causing one or more processors to perform: receiving, at a plagiarism detector, an encoded test lead sheet representing a test lead sheet having a plurality of passages; generating a set of annotations describing a level of plagiarism of a plurality of elements of the encoded test lead sheet in relation to a plurality of preexisting encoded lead sheets; and presenting via an output device, the annotations.
