6. The method of claim 1, wherein user credentials of the list are each associated with a presented meeting rating score computed based on previous attendance to invited meetings and/or events, wherein user credentials that have a higher rate of attendance to invited meetings and/or events are assigned a higher score relative to other user credentials that have a lower rate of attendance to invited meetings and/or events.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein list set of user credentials for attending the meeting and/or event includes a plurality of predefined groups of user credentials, wherein the optimal time slots and optimal locations are presented within a calendar in the GUI presenting a summary of scheduled meetings and/or events for the plurality of predefined groups.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein at least one certain user credential is a member of at least two predefined groups, and wherein the GUI automatically determines a conflict when the at least two predefined groups are set to occur during a common time optimal slot at different respective locations.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein list set of user credentials for attending the meeting and/or event includes a plurality of predefined groups of user credentials, and further comprising: presenting a group hub within the GUI in response to selection of one group of the plurality of groups, the group hub including at least one feature selected from the group consisting of: a group chat GUI for interactive communication between a plurality of user credentials of the one group, a group content feature for posting content and viewing the posted content within the GUI between the plurality of user credentials of the one group, an upcoming meeting and/or event feature for viewing within the GUI upcoming scheduled meetings and/or events including the one group, a create meeting and/or event feature for creating new meetings and/or events for the one group via the GUI, a reminder of meeting and/or event feature for creating custom reminders for upcoming scheduled meetings and/or events for transmission to client terminals of the plurality of user credentials of the one group, a view group calendar feature for presenting within the GUI a calendar including upcoming scheduled meetings, a plurality of folders each storing previously posted content and/or chats and/or content for viewing within the GUI, a group log storing a list of activities of the one group for viewing the GUI, and a group report GUI for creating reports from the group data and printing it and/or sharing it between a plurality of user credentials of the one group.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the meeting comprises a current occurrence of a recurring meeting associated with at least one previous occurrence, wherein the list of user credentials for attending the meeting include user credentials that attended the at least one previous occurrence, and further comprising: presenting within the GUI, a summary for each at least one previous occurrence of the recurring meeting, the meeting summary including a plurality of fields selected from the group consisting of: invited user credentials, participating user credentials, key meeting details, meeting conclusion, and recommendations for following meetings; in response to an indication of termination of the current occurrence, generating a meeting feedback form including the plurality of fields; transmitting the meeting feedback form to the plurality of user credentials; receiving a plurality of replies; and aggregating the plurality of fields from the plurality of replies to generate a summary for the current occurrence.
