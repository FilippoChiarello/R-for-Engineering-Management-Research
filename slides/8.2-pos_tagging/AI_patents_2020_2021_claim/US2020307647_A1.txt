METHOD AND DEVICE FOR ADAPTING A DRIVING STRATEGY OF AN AT LEAST PARTIALLY AUTOMATED TRANSPORTATION VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
A method for adapting a driving strategy of a transportation vehicle driving in at least semi-automated state, wherein the adapting takes place based on at least one occupant condition, captured by at least one sensor system, of an occupant, wherein a sleep phase is determined by the at least one sensor system during a sleeping condition of the occupant, wherein the driving strategy is adapted by a control device based on the determined sleep phase. An apparatus for adapting a driving strategy of a transportation vehicle driving in at least semi-automated state having at least one sensor system for capturing an occupant condition of an occupant, and a control device for adapting the driving strategy, wherein the at least one sensor system determines a sleep phase during a sleeping condition of the occupant, and wherein the control device adapts a driving strategy based on the determined sleep phase.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An apparatus for adapting a driving strategy of a transportation vehicle driving in at least a semi-automated state, the apparatus comprising: at least one sensor system for capturing an occupant condition of an occupant; and a control device for adapting the driving strategy, wherein the at least one sensor system determines a sleep phase during a sleeping condition of the occupant, and wherein the control device adapts a driving strategy based on the determined sleep phase.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein a sensitivity value for the sleeping occupant in respect of external environmental influences is estimated or stipulated by the control device based on the determined sleep phase, wherein the driving strategy is adapted based on the estimated or stipulated sensitivity value.
3. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the driving strategy is adapted based on an assessed or expectable loudness on a journey route implemented as part of the driving strategy.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the driving strategy is adapted by decreasing accelerations in response to a sleep phase with a shallow depth of sleep being determined and increasing accelerations in response to a deep sleep phase being determined as sleep phase.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the transportation vehicle is brought to a standstill in response to a falling-asleep phase being determined as sleep phase, wherein a suitable journey route is chosen or the journey route is adapted accordingly.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein a future sleep phase and/or a waking time or waking time window for the sleeping occupant is estimated based on a determined sleep phase and/or an ascertained time characteristic of determined sleep phases.
7. The apparatus of claim 6, wherein a sleeping occupant is woken based on the estimated waking time or waking time window.
8. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein at least one infrastructure property is selected based on the determined sleep phase and/or an estimated future sleep phase, wherein a journey route is additionally chosen or adapted based on at least one infrastructure property of the journey route.
9. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein at least one sleep profile of an occupant is stored in the control device, wherein the driving strategy is adapted based on the stored sleep profile of the occupant.
10. A method for adapting a driving strategy of a transportation vehicle driving in at least a semi-automated state, wherein the adapting takes place based on at least one occupant condition, captured by at least one sensor system, of an occupant, the method comprising: determining a sleep phase by the at least one sensor system during a sleeping condition of the occupant; and adapting the driving strategy by a control device based on the determined sleep phase.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein a sensitivity value for the sleeping occupant in respect of external environmental influences is estimated or stipulated by the control device based on the determined sleep phase, wherein the driving strategy is adapted based on the estimated or stipulated sensitivity value.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the driving strategy is adapted based on an assessed or expectable loudness on a journey route implemented as part of the driving strategy.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein the driving strategy is adapted by decreasing accelerations in response to a sleep phase with a shallow depth of sleep being determined and increasing accelerations in response to a deep sleep phase being determined as sleep phase.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein the transportation vehicle is brought to a standstill in response to a falling-asleep phase being determined as sleep phase, wherein a suitable journey route is chosen or the journey route is adapted accordingly.
15. The method of claim 10, wherein a future sleep phase and/or a waking time or waking time window for the sleeping occupant is estimated based on a determined sleep phase and/or an ascertained time characteristic of determined sleep phases.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein a sleeping occupant is woken based on the estimated waking time or waking time window.
17. The method of claim 10, wherein at least one infrastructure property is selected based on the determined sleep phase and/or an estimated future sleep phase, wherein a journey route is additionally chosen or adapted based on at least one infrastructure property of the journey route.
18. The method of claim 10, wherein at least one sleep profile of an occupant is stored in the control device, wherein the driving strategy is adapted based on the stored sleep profile of the occupant.
