INTELLIGENCT IDENTIFICATION METHOD FOR VIBRATION CHARACTERISTIC OF ROTATING MACHINERY
</title>

<abstract>
An intelligent identification method for a vibration characteristic of rotating machinery, the steps providing converting a speed or acceleration time domain signal of mechanical vibration to a frequency domain envelope spectrum by signal processing, extracting a frequency upper limit value fmax of the envelope spectrum; at least screening out a high energy harmonic with a frequency range within fmax/Nmax by amplitude comparison. Nmax is a frequency multiple upper limit multiple for performing a frequency multiple check on the high energy harmonic. Then, extracting at least one set of characteristic parameters, based on respective amplitudes and/or frequencies, of 1-fold to Nmax-fold frequency region peaks of each high energy harmonic. The 1-fold frequency region peak of the high energy harmonic is the high energy harmonic itself. Finally, inputting the at least one set of characteristic parameters of each high energy harmonic into a machine learning intelligent algorithm to perform training and calculation.
