<title>
Cell epitopes and combination of cell epitopes for use in the immunotherapy of myeloma and other cancers
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to peptides, proteins, nucleic acids and cells for use in immunotherapeutic methods. In particular, the present invention relates to the immunotherapy of cancer, in particular myeloma. The present invention furthermore relates to tumor-associated T-cell peptide epitopes, alone or in combination with other tumor-associated peptides that can for example serve as active pharmaceutical ingredients of vaccine compositions that stimulate anti-tumor immune responses, or to stimulate T cells ex vivo and transfer into patients. Peptides bound to molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), or peptides as such, can also be targets of antibodies, soluble T-cell receptors, and other binding molecules.

<claims>
1. A method of eliciting an immune response in a patient who has cancer, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a population of activated T cells that selectively recognize cancer cells that present a peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, or 28, wherein the activated T cells are produced by contacting T cells with the peptide loaded onto a human class I MHC molecule expressed on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell for a period of time sufficient to activate the T cells, wherein said cancer is selected from myeloma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, brain cancer, stomach cancer, colon or rectal cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, leukemia, breast cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), melanoma, ovarian cancer, esophageal cancer, urinary bladder cancer, endometrial cancer, gall bladder cancer, and bile duct cancer.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the T cells are autologous to the patient.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the T cells are obtained from a healthy donor.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the T cells are obtained from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the activated T cells are expanded in vitro.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the peptide is in a complex with the class I MHC molecule.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the antigen presenting cell is infected with recombinant virus expressing the peptide.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the antigen presenting cell is a dendritic cell or a macrophage.
9. The method of claim 5, wherein the expansion is in the presence of an anti-CD28 antibody and IL-12.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the population of activated T cells comprises CD8-positive cells.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the contacting is in vitro.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the composition further comprises an adjuvant.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the adjuvant is selected from anti-CD40 antibody, imiquimod, resiquimod, GM-CSF, cyclophosphamide, sunitinib, bevacizumab, interferon-alpha, interferon-beta, CpG oligonucleotides and derivatives, poly-(I:C) and derivatives, RNA, sildenafil, particulate formulations with poly(lactide co-glycolide) (PLG), virosomes, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-21, and IL-23.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the immune response comprises a cytotoxic T cell response.
15. A method of killing cancer cells, comprising performing the method of eliciting an immune response of claim 1, wherein the cancer cells are killed.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the immune response comprises a cytotoxic T cell response.
17. The method of claim 1, wherein the cancer is myeloma.
18. The method of claim 12, wherein the adjuvant comprises IL-2.
19. The method of claim 12, wherein the adjuvant comprises IL-7.
20. The method of claim 12, wherein the adjuvant comprises IL-15.
21. The method of claim 1, wherein the peptide consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 19.
22. The method of claim 1, wherein the peptide consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20.
23. The method of claim 1, wherein the peptide consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 23.
24. The method of claim 1, wherein the peptide consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 24.
25. The method of claim 1, wherein the peptide consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 25.
26. The method of claim 1, wherein the peptide consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26.
27. The method of claim 1, wherein the peptide consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 27.
28. The method of claim 1, wherein the peptide consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 28.
