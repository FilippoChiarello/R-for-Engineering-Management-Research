Information processor, information processing method, and program
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided an information processor including circuitry configured to identify a part of a moving image in response to an audible sound input of a user, wherein the moving image is generated by a capturing of an imaging unit which is attached to the user.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An information processing server comprising: a storage unit; and a controller configured to receive, via a wireless network, image data of a moving image that is captured by an imaging unit, record the received image data in the storage unit, receive, via the wireless network, audible data of an audible sound input that is acquired by a microphone, while the imaging unit is transmitting the image data of the moving image to the information processing server in real time, determine whether the received audible data includes a specific command, determine whether the received audible data includes information designating a specific subject, and extract a part of the recorded image data of the moving image based on the determination that the audible data includes the specific command and based on a result of performing machine learning on the recorded image data of the moving image.
2. The information processing server according to claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to acquire additional information indicating positional information of the imaging unit, and extract the part of the recorded image data of the moving image based on the specific command, the positional information, and the result of performing machine learning on the recorded image data of the moving image.
3. The information processing server according to claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to initiate a displaying of the extracted part of the recorded image data of the moving image.
4. The information processing server according to claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to initiate a displaying of a thumbnail image corresponding to the specific command within the recorded image data of the moving image.
5. An information processing method comprising: receiving, via a wireless network, image data of a moving image that is captured by an imaging unit; recording the received image data in a storage unit; receiving, via the wireless network, audible data of an audible sound input that is acquired by a microphone, while the imaging unit is transmitting the image data of the moving image to an information processing server in real time; determining whether the received audible data includes a specific command; determining whether the received audible data includes information designating a specific subject; and extracting a part of the recorded image data of the moving image based on the determination that the audible data includes the specific command and based on a result of performing machine learning on the recorded image data of the moving image.
6. A non-transitory computer-readable medium having embodied thereon a program, which when executed by a computer causes the computer to execute a method, the method comprising: receiving, via a wireless network, image data of a moving image that is captured by an imaging unit; recording the received image data in a storage unit; receiving, via the wireless network, audible data of an audible sound input that is acquired by a microphone, while the imaging unit is transmitting the image data of the moving image to an information processing server in real time; determining whether the received audible data includes a specific command; determining whether the received audible data includes information designating a specific subject; and extracting a part of the recorded image data of the moving image based on the determination that the audible data includes the specific command and based on a result of performing machine learning on the recorded image data of the moving image.
7. The information processing server according to claim 1, wherein the specific command includes a first specific word indicating a specific timing based on a timing when the controller receives the audible sound.
8. The information processing server according to claim 7, wherein the controller extracts the part of the image data of the moving image corresponding to a predetermined past period from the timing when the controller receives the audible sound, based on a determination that the received audible data includes the first specific word.
9. The information processing server according to claim 8, wherein the specific command includes a second specific word indicating a specific location, and the controller extracts the part of the image data of the moving image corresponding to both of the specific location and the predetermined past period, based on a determination that the received audible data includes the first specific word and the second specific word.
10. The information processing server according to claim 7, wherein the first specific word indicates non-quantitative information, and the controller extracts the part of the image data of the moving image having a predetermined time width corresponding to non-quantitative information.
11. The information processor according to claim 7, wherein the first specific word includes a pronoun word.
12. The information processing server according to claim 1, wherein the specific command includes a specific word indicating a specific location, and the controller extracts the part of the image data of the moving image corresponding to the specific location, based on a determination that the received audible data includes the specific word.
