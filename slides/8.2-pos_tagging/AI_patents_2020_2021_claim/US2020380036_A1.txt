METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR CHAINING BIOGRAPHIC INPUTS USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
</title>

<abstract>
A system for chaining biographic inputs using artificial intelligence includes a computing device, a biographic parameter module operating on the computing device wherein the biographic parameter module is configured to receive a first biographic input wherein the first biographic input identifies a user; parse the first biographic input to retrieve a key element; and retrieve an element of stored data relating to the key element wherein the element of stored data further comprises a plurality of biographic inputs; and a chaining module, the transmission module configured to receive the first biographic input and the element of stored data from the biographic parameter module; evaluate the first biographic input and the element of stored data to determine a relation between the first biographic input and the element of stored data; and chain the first biographic input and the element of stored data.

<claims>
1. A system for chaining biographic inputs using artificial intelligence the system comprising: a computing device; a biographic parameter module operating on the computing device wherein the biographic parameter module is configured to: receive a first biographic input, wherein the first biographic input identifies a user; parse the first biographic input to retrieve a key element; and retrieve an element of stored data relating to the key element wherein the element of stored data further comprises a plurality of biographic inputs; and a chaining module operating on the computing device wherein the chaining module is configured to: receive the first biographic input and the element of stored data from the biographic parameter module; evaluate the first biographic input and the element of stored data to determine a relation between the first biographic input and the element of stored data; and chain the first biographic input and the element of stored data.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the biographic parameter module is configured to receive the first biographic input from a user device.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the biographic parameter module is configured to receive the first biographic input from a user network device.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the biographic parameter module is further configured to: generate a query utilizing the first biographic input; and retrieve the element of stored data utilizing the query.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the query relates to a category.
6. The system of claim 4, wherein the query relates to a participant.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the biographic parameter module is further configured to: classify, the first biographic input to a life theme using a first classification algorithm; and retrieve an element of stored data relating to the life theme.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the chaining module is further configured to: generate a biographic learner, wherein the biographic learner learns user milestones by evaluating biographic inputs relating to a user, using a machine-learning process; and create a milestone label for the first biographic input and the element of stored data.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the chaining module is further configured to: utilize the milestone label to generate a request for the second biographic input; and transmit the request for the second biographic input to a user network device.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the chaining module is further configured to: receive a second biographic input from a user network device; and chain the second biographic input to the first biographic input.
11. A method of chaining biographic inputs using artificial intelligence the method comprising: receiving by a computing device, a first biographic input wherein the first biographic input identifies a user; parsing by the computing device, the first biographic input to retrieve a key element; retrieving by the computing device, an element of stored data relating to the key element wherein the element of stored data further comprises a plurality of biographic inputs; evaluating by the computing device, the first biographic input and the element of stored data to determine a relation between the first biographic input and the element of stored data; and chaining by the computing device, the first biographic input and the element of stored data.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the computing device receives the first biographic input from a user device.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the computing device receives the first biographic input from a user network device.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein retrieving the element of stored data further comprises: generating a query utilizing the first biographic input; and retrieving the element of stored data utilizing the query.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the query relates to a category.
16. The method of claim 14, wherein the query relates to a participant.
17. The method of claim 11, wherein retrieving the element of stored data further comprises: classifying the first biographic input to a life theme using a first classification algorithm; and retrieving an element of stored data relating to the life theme.
18. The method of claim 11, wherein evaluating the first biographic input further comprises: generating a biographic learner, wherein the biographic learner learns user milestones by evaluating biographic inputs relating to a user using a machine-learning process; and creating a milestone label for the first biographic input and the element of stored data.
19. The method of claim 18 further comprising: utilizing the milestone label to generate the request for the second biographic input; and transmitting the request for the second biographic input to a user network device.
20. The method of claim 11 further comprising: receiving a second biographic input from a user network device; and chaining the second biographic input to the first biographic input.
