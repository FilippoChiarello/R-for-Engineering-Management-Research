TECHNOLOGIES FOR PROVIDING AN ACCELERATOR DEVICE DISCOVERY SERVICE
</title>

<abstract>
Technologies for providing an accelerator device discovery service include a device having circuitry configured to obtain, from a discovery service, availability data indicative of a set of accelerator devices available to assist in the execution of a workload. The circuitry is also configured to select, as a function of the availability data, one or more target accelerator devices to assist in the execution of the workload, and execute the workload with the one or more target accelerator devices.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A device comprising:
circuitry to: obtain, from a discovery service, availability data indicative of a set of accelerator devices available to assist in the execution of a workload; select, as a function of the availability data, one or more target accelerator devices to assist in the execution of the workload; and execute the workload with the one or more target accelerator devices.
2. The device of claim 1, wherein to obtain the availability data comprises to: send, to a discovery service executed by an orchestrator server, a request for the availability data; and receive, from the discovery service, availability data indicative of one or more accelerator devices available to a tenant associated with the request.
3. The device of claim 2, wherein to send a request for the availability data comprises to send a request that includes data indicative of the tenant.
4. The device of claim 1, wherein to obtain the availability data comprises to (i) receive an identifier of each of the one or more accelerator devices available to assist in the execution of the workload, (ii) to receive data indicative of a type of each accelerator device available to assist in the execution of the workload, (iii) receive data indicative of a kernel present on each accelerator device, (iv) communication data usable to enable communication between the device and each accelerator device available to assist in the execution of the workload, or (v) receive quality of service data indicative of a present quality of service parameter associated with each accelerator device available to assist in the execution of the workload.
5. The device of claim 1, wherein to select, as a function of the availability data, one or more target accelerator devices to assist in the execution of the workload comprises to determine one or more compatible types of accelerator devices for the workload.
6. The device of claim 1, wherein to select, as a function of the availability data, one or more target accelerator devices to assist in the execution of the workload comprises to read metadata indicative of one or more kernels capable of performing operations within the workload.
7. The device of claim 1, wherein to select, as a function of the availability data, one or more target accelerator devices to assist in the execution of the workload comprises to select, as a function of a target quality of service and quality of service data associated with each accelerator device available to assist in the execution of the workload, one or more of the accelerator devices as one or more target accelerator devices.
8. The accelerator device of claim 1, wherein to select as a function of the availability data, one or more target accelerator devices to assist in the execution of the workload comprises to partition the workload into multiple sections to be performed by multiple target accelerator devices.
9. A method comprising: obtaining, by a device and from a discovery service, availability data indicative of a set of accelerator devices available to assist in the execution of a workload; selecting, by the device and as a function of the availability data, one or more target accelerator devices to assist in the execution of the workload; and executing, by the device, the workload with the one or more target accelerator devices.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein obtaining the availability data comprises: sending, to a discovery service executed by an orchestrator server, a request for the availability data; and receiving, from the discovery service, availability data indicative of one or more accelerator devices available to a tenant associated with the request.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein sending a request for the availability data comprises sending a request that includes data indicative of the tenant.
12. The method of claim 9, wherein selecting, as a function of the availability data, one or more target accelerator devices to assist in the execution of the workload comprises reading metadata indicative of one or more kernels capable of performing operations within the workload.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein selecting, as a function of the availability data, one or more target accelerator devices to assist in the execution of the workload comprises selecting, as a function of a target quality of service and quality of service data associated with each accelerator device available to assist in the execution of the workload, one or more of the accelerator devices as one or more target accelerator devices.
14. One or more machine-readable storage media comprising a plurality of instructions stored thereon that, when executed, causes an accelerator sled to perform the method of any of claims 10-13.
15. An accelerator sled comprising means for performing the method of any of claims 10-13.
