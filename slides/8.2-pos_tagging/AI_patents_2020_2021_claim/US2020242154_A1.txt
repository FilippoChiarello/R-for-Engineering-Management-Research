IMAGE FILE GENERATING DEVICE AND IMAGE FILE GENERATING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An image file generating device that generates image files constituting training data candidates, comprising a processor that has a metadata generating section for generating metadata in order to designate (1) if inference is for detecting a physical object within an image, and (2) whether inference is for predicting change in images that are continuous in time, wherein the metadata generating section generates the metadata based on information corresponding to times before and after the images have been acquired.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An image file generating device that generates image files constituting training data candidates, comprising: a processor having a metadata generating section for generating metadata for designating (1) if inference is for detecting a physical object within an image, and (2) if inference is for predicting change in images that are continuous in time series, wherein the metadata generating section generates the metadata based on information corresponding to time before and after the images have been acquired.
2. The image file generating device of claim 1, wherein: as information corresponding to time before and after images have been acquired, the metadata generating section, in a case where there are images that have been selected by the user, generates metadata for prediction inference for predicting change in images that are continuous in time, with time of that acquisition as the information, or, if there is acquisition of specified sensor information, generates metadata with acquisition time of the sensor information as the information.
3. The image file generating device of claim 1, wherein: the metadata generating section generates metadata for inference in order to detect a physical object within the image, in accordance with whether it was possible to detect part of an image corresponding to a specific physical object, within images that have been acquired at times before and after images have been acquired, as information corresponding to times before and after images have been acquired.
4. The image file generating device of claim 2, wherein: the metadata generating section generates metadata with retroactive times as annotation information, in the event that specified purpose information is for prediction inference.
5. The image file generating device of claim 1, wherein: the metadata generating section determines predicted value in the above described prediction purpose, by external sensor synchronized determination that automatically determines specified conditions and/or release determination using a manual operation to confirm and perform a user's live view display.
6. The image file generating device of claim 1, further comprising: memory that stores the sensor synchronized determination and/or the release determination, as the information corresponding to time before and after acquisition.
7. The image file generating device of claim 1, wherein: the metadata generating section makes information as to whether information was selected subjectively or selected objectively, into metadata as information corresponding to time before and after acquisition.
8. The image file generating device of claim 1, wherein: in a case where it has been determined that inference is for detecting a physical object within an image, the metadata generating section generates information for image quality of a physical image to be determined by an inference model that is created, or for images in which physical object changes in association with an act.
9. The image file generating device of claim 1, wherein: further, the metadata generating section generates information as to whether the image data will be made training data for externally requested learning, or made hidden reference data, as metadata.
10. The image file generating device of claim 1, further comprising: an inference engine that detects specific sections of an image by inference, using an inference model, wherein, the metadata generating section creates the metadata in a case where inference results using the inference engine have failed.
11. An image file generating method for generating image files having training data candidates, comprising: inputting purpose information that has been designated; and generating metadata for designating that purpose of an inference model that will be created is for prediction, wherein regarding the generation of the metadata, at the time of creating an inference model in which images associated with image data are made training data candidates, when the purpose information that has been designated is for prediction, metadata is generated with retroactive time as annotation information.
12. The image file generating method of claim 11, wherein: further, in the metadata generation, predicted value in the above described prediction purpose is determined by external sensor synchronized determination that automatically determines specified conditions and/or release determination using a manual operation to confirm and perform a user's live view display.
13. The image file generating method of claim 11, wherein: the sensor synchronized determination and/or release determination are stored in memory.
14. The image file generating method of claim 11, wherein: in the generating of the metadata, further, information as to whether determination of the predicted value is subjective or objective is made into metadata, with sensor synchronization being made objective, and release being made subjective.
15. The image file generating method of claim 11, wherein: in the metadata generation, metadata is generated with images that are not for prediction as candidates for detection usage for detecting a physical object contained in an image.
16. The image file generating method of claim 11, wherein: in the generation of metadata, information as to whether what is being determined by an inference model to be further created is for quality of that image itself, or images that change in association with an event, is generated.
17. A server that provides training data, comprising: a reception circuit that receives image data and metadata relating to the image data, and a processor having a collecting section and a provision section, wherein the collecting section determines whether purpose information that has been designated by the metadata is (1) inference for detecting a physical object within an image, or is (2) inference for predicting change of images that are continuous in time series, and gathers image data by classifying in accordance with the result of determination, and the provision section provides image data that has been collected by the collecting section as a training data group.
18. The server of claim 17, wherein: if the purpose information that has been designated is for prediction, the metadata is generated with retroactive times as annotation information.
