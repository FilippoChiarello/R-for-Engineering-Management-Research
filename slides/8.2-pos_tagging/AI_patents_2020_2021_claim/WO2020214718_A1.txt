RRM2 SIGNATURE GENES AS PROGNOSTIC MARKERS IN PROSTATE CANCER PATIENTS
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides methods for identifying cancers associated with poor prognosis (e.g., prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, or liver cancer) in a patient in need thereof. The methods disclosed herein are useful in determining whether a patient will benefit from treatment with ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors based on detecting elevated expression levels of specific RRM2 signature genes.
