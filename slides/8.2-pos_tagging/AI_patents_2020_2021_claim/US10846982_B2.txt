Method for configuring casino operations
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a method of optimizing at least one performance variable, such as revenue or profitability, indicative of the performance of a casino. An initial set of operating parameters is set. At least one environmental variable, such as traffic, weather, time, cost of transportation, etc. are monitored as is the performance variable. An artificial intelligence program changes operating parameters, such as player-tracking rewards, bonuses, comps, advertising, etc. The program determines the effect of the change, and further changes the operating parameter as a function of the effect and the environmental variable.

<claims>
1. A gaming system located at a first casino comprising: a plurality of electronic gaming machines, each of which includes: a non-transitory memory device configured to store computer-readable instructions to facilitate play of the electronic gaming machine, an accepting device configured to engage a physical item associated with a monetary value, the monetary value establishing a credit balance that is decreasable based on at least wagering activity, at least one meter to track at least one of play or awards on the gaming machine, and a cashout device for redeeming the credit balance in response to actuation of a cashout button; a network operatively connecting the gaming machines on which data from the at least one meter is transmitted to a database; at least one computer processor operatively connected to the network, the at least one processor configured to: implement a promotion program via commands sent over the network to at least some of the electronic gaming machines, the promotion program including at least one promotion at the first casino, the at least one promotion comprising doubling the jackpot for at least one of the electronic gaming machines while the at least one promotion is in effect; monitor a global computer network for at least one of promotions or inducements offered by a second casino that competes with the first casino; determine a change to the promotion program at the first casino as a function of the meter data and the monitored promotions or inducements offered by the second casino; generate an automated command that reflects the change; transmit the automated command over the network to the at least some of the electronic gaming machines; and change the promotion program responsive to the automated command.
2. A method of controlling promotions at a first casino having a plurality of electronic gaming machines connected to a network comprising: implementing a promotion program that includes at least one promotion at the first casino, the at least one promotion comprising a bonus for at least one of the electronic gaming machines while the at least one promotion is in effect; accumulating data related to the financial performance of the first casino from at least one meter associated with each of at least some of the electronic gaming machines; transmitting the financial data over the network to a computing device operatively connected to the network; storing the financial data in a memory operatively connected to the computing device; monitoring, via a computer process, a global computer network for at least one of promotions or inducements offered by a second casino that competes with the first casino; determining, via a computer process operatively connected to the network, a change to the promotion program at the first casino as a function of the financial data and the monitored promotions or inducements offered by the second casino; automatically, via a computer process operatively connected to the network, generating command that reflects the change; transmitting the command over the network; and changing the promotion program responsive to the command.
3. A method of controlling advertising for casino promotions in a first casino having a plurality of electronic gaming machines connected to a network comprising: placing at least one advertisement for services offered by the first casino in at least one of print media, broadcast media, direct mail, or electronic communication; accumulating data related to the financial performance of the first casino from at least one meter associated with each of at least some of the electronic gaming machines; transmitting the financial data over the network to a computing device operatively connected to the network; storing the financial data in a memory operatively connected to the computing device; monitoring, via a computer process, a global computer network for at least one of promotions or inducements offered by a second casino that competes with the first casino; determining, via a computer process, a change to advertising placed by the first casino as a function of the financial data and the monitored promotions or inducements offered by the second casino; automatically, via a computer process, generating a command that reflects the advertising change; transmitting the command to a computing device that controls an advertising venue; automatically changing the advertising responsive to the command; and storing at least an advertising budget in a memory that is operatively connected to the network and wherein the change to advertising is further a function of the advertising budget.
4. The method of claim 3 wherein the advertising venue comprises advertising on a global computer network.
5. The method of claim 3 wherein the change to advertising comprises advertising a promotion at the first casino.
6. A method of controlling promotions at a first casino having a plurality of electronic gaming machines connected to a network comprising: implementing a promotion program that includes at least one promotion at the first casino, the at least one promotion comprising changing the payback percentage of at least one of the electronic gaming machines while the at least one promotion is in effect; accumulating data related to the financial performance of the first casino from at least one meter associated with each of at least some of the electronic gaming machines; transmitting the financial data over the network to a computing device operatively connected to the network; storing the financial data in a memory operatively connected to the computing device; monitoring, via a computer process, a global computer network for at least one of promotions or inducements offered by a second casino that competes with the first casino; determining, via a computer process operatively connected to the network, a change to the promotion program at the first casino as a function of the financial data and the monitored promotions or inducements offered by the second casino; automatically, via a computer process operatively connected to the network, generating command that reflects the change; transmitting the command over the network; and changing the promotion program responsive to the command.
7. A method of controlling promotions at a first casino having a plurality of electronic gaming machines connected to a network comprising: implementing a promotion program that includes at least one promotion at the first casino, the at least one promotion comprising changing the game configuration of at least one of the electronic gaming machines while the at least one promotion is in effect; accumulating data related to the financial performance of the first casino from at least one meter associated with each of at least some of the electronic gaming machines; transmitting the financial data over the network to a computing device operatively connected to the network; storing the financial data in a memory operatively connected to the computing device; monitoring, via a computer process, a global computer network for at least one of promotions or inducements offered by a second casino that competes with the first casino; determining, via a computer process operatively connected to the network, a change to the promotion program at the first casino as a function of the financial data and the monitored promotions or inducements offered by the second casino; automatically, via a computer process operatively connected to the network, generating command that reflects the change; transmitting the command over the network; and changing the promotion program responsive to the command.
