NEW GENE SIGNATURES FOR PREDICTING SURVIVAL TIME IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM RENAL CELL CARCINOMA
</title>

<abstract>
Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) encompasses a heterogeneous group of cancers derived from renal tubular epithelial cells and has a worldwide mortality. However, mortality rates have barely improved over the last 20 years. Novel biomarkers and biomarkers are thus urgently required for this cancer. The inventors have devised a strategy to produce mouse cancer cell lines of progressively enhanced aggressiveness and specialization. The mouse renal cancer cell line RENCA was serially passaged in vivo using multiple implantation strategies designed to replicate different aspects of primary tumour growth and metastasis. Transcriptomic and epigenomic data has been acquired for the derived cell lines and primary analyses have been performed. The inventors then selected plurality of genes with no reported role in RCC, and checked their relevance in patient data samples. This approach contributes to identify several gene signatures that are suitable for predicting survival time in patients suffering from RCC.

<claims>
1. A method for predicting the survival time of a patient suffering from a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) comprising determining the expression level of at least one gene in a sample obtained from the patient wherein said gene is selected from the group consisting of ATP 1 A3, AVIL, CCL8, CES2, CFB, COL6A3, CRABP2, DNAJC12, F3, FAIM2, IL2RG, IL34, KRT13, KRT17, LRG1, MAGEB1, MAGEB2, MAGEC2, MAGEC3, MMP3, NAT8, PLAC, PPARGC1A, PPEF1, PTGIR, PTPN14, RAC2, SAA1, SAA2, SAMSN1, SERPINA3, SLC11A1, SLC2A3, TPRG1, TSPAN32, UCK2, WAS, WT1 , BASP1, DPYSL3, GLIPR2, HMGA2, RAB15, SNAI2 and PCBP3.
2. The method of claim 1 comprising determining the expression levels of KRT13, LRG1, SAA2, SAA1, SAMSN1, SERPINA3, SLC2A3, UCK2, and WT1 in the sample obtained from the patient.
3. The method of claim 1 comprising determining the expression levels of NAT8, PPARGC1 A, TPRG1, and WAS in the sample obtained from the patient.
4. The method of claim 1 comprising determining the expression level of ATP1A3 in the sample obtained from the patient.
5. The method of claim 1 comprising determining the expression levels of AVIL, CES2, FAIM2, KRT17, PTGIR, and RAC2 in the sample obtained from the patient.
6. The method of claim 1 comprising determining the expression levels of MAGEC2, MAGEC3, CCL8, CFB, COL6A3, DNAJC12, IL2RG, IL34, and PLAC 8 in the sample obtained from the patient.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein the sample is a tissue tumor sample.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein a score which is a composite of the expression levels of the different biomarkers is determined and compared to the predetermined reference value wherein a difference between said score and said predetermined reference value is indicative whether the patient will have a long or short survival time.
9. Use of the method of claim 1 for selecting a therapeutic regimen or determining if a certain therapeutic regimen is more appropriate for a patient identified as having a poor prognosis.
10. Use of the method of claim 1 for monitoring of RCC in a patient wherein if on a first (i.e. initial) testing the patient is identified as having a poor prognosis, the patient can be administered an anti-cancer therapy, and on a second (i.e. follow-up testing), the patient is identified as having a good prognosis, the patient can be administered an anti cancer therapy at a maintenance dose.
11. Use of the method of claim 1 for determining whether the patient will be responsive or experience a positive treatment outcome to a treatment.
