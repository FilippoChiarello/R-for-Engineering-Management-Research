METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PERFORMING AUTOMATIC VESTIBULAR ASSESSMENT
</title>

<abstract>
The invention provides a headgear apparatus for performing vestibular assessment of a user. The headgear apparatus includes a processor, a memory and a display device for displaying a plurality of visual stimuli and a hardware means to provide a plurality of non-visual stimuli to the user. A plurality of infrared cameras and an inertial measurement device are employed for measuring eye movement and head movement in response to visual stimuli/non-visual stimuli provided to the user and generating one or more graph based patterns. Headgear apparatus further includes a laser source for providing a laser beam to be projected on a surface during presentation of non-visual stimuli. Accordingly, a machine learning model is employed for interpreting the one or more graph based patterns to detect the presence of an abnormality.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A headgear apparatus for performing vestibular assessment of a user, the headgear apparatus comprising:
a processor;
a memory communicatively coupled to the processor; a display device communicatively coupled to the processor and the memory, wherein the display device is configured to display a plurality of visual stimuli to the user;
a hardware means for providing a plurality of non-visual stimuli to the user;
a plurality of infrared cameras for measuring an eye movement of the user in response to one of the plurality of visual stimuli displayed to the user and the plurality of non-visual stimuli provided to the user; and
an inertial measurement device for determining a head movement of the user in response to one of the plurality of visual stimuli displayed to the user and the plurality of non-visual stimuli provided to the user, wherein the hardware means, the plurality of infrared cameras and the inertial measurement device are communicatively coupled to the processor and the memory;
wherein the processor is configured to:
generate one or more graph based patterns based on one of the eye movement and the head movement of the user; and
interpret the one or more graph based patterns using a machine learning model to detect a presence of an abnormality based on one of a nystagmus pattern, eye movement pattern, head movement pattern and torsion pattern.
2. The headgear apparatus of claim 1, wherein the plurality of visual stimuli corresponds to one of a smooth pursuit test, saccade test, optokinetic test, gaze test and a combination.
3. The headgear apparatus of claim 1, wherein the plurality of non-visual stimuli corresponds to one of mastoid vibration, caloric, Valsalva, Hyperventilation, Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR) suppression, positional stimulus, head shaking, head thrust and head impulse.
4. The headgear apparatus of claim 1, wherein a mixed simulation of visual stimuli and non-visual stimuli is provided to the user.
5. The headgear apparatus of claim 1, wherein the mixed simulation includes a real-life projection.
6. The headgear apparatus of claim 1 further includes a laser source.
7. The headgear apparatus of claim 1, wherein the inertial measurement device determines one of a deliberate head movement and an erroneous head movement.
8. The headgear apparatus of claim 1, wherein the vestibular assessment includes identifying a vestibular condition associated with the user, wherein the vestibular condition is one of brain diseases, nerve palsy, concussion, Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), strokes, early Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV).
9. The headgear apparatus of claim 1 is a pair of augmented reality goggles.
10. A method for performing vestibular analysis/assessment of a user using a headgear apparatus, the method comprising:
displaying, by one or more processors of the headgear apparatus, a plurality of visual stimuli to the user;
providing, by one or more processors of the headgear apparatus, a plurality of non-visual stimuli to the user;
measuring, using a plurality of infrared cameras of the headgear apparatus, an eye movement of the user in response to one of the plurality of visual stimuli displayed to the user and the plurality of non-visual stimuli provided to the user; and
determining, using an inertial measurement device of the headgear apparatus, a head movement of the user in response to one of the plurality of visual stimuli displayed to the user and the plurality of non-visual stimuli provided to the user;
generating, by one or more processors of the headgear apparatus, one or more graph based patterns based on one of the eye movement and the head movement of the user; and
interpreting, by one or more processors of the headgear apparatus, the one or more graph based patterns using a machine learning model to detect a presence of an abnormality based on one of a nystagmus pattern, eye movement pattern, head movement pattern and torsion pattern.
11. The method of claim 7, wherein the plurality of visual stimuli corresponds to one of a smooth pursuit test, saccadic test, optokinetic test, gaze test and a combination.
12. The method of claim 7, wherein the plurality of non-visual stimuli corresponds to one of mastoid vibration, caloric, Valsalva, Hyperventilation, Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR) suppression head shaking, head thrust head impulse and positional testing.
13. The method of claim 7, wherein a mixed simulation of visual stimuli and non -visual stimuli is provided to the user.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein the mixed simulation includes a real-life projection.
15. The method of claim 7, wherein the inertial movement device determines one of a deliberate head movement and an erroneous head movement.
16. The method of claim 7, wherein the vestibular assessment includes identifying a vestibular condition associated with the user, wherein the vestibular condition is one of brain diseases, nerve palsy, concussion, Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), strokes, early Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV).
17. The method of claim 7, wherein the headgear apparatus is a pair of augmented reality goggles.
