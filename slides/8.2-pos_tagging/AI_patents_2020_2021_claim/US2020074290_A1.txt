<title>
COMPLEX VALUED GATING MECHANISMS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods relating to neural networks. More specifically, the present invention relates to complex valued gating mechanisms which may be used as neurons in a neural network. A novel complex gated recurrent unit and a novel complex recurrent unit use real values for amplitude normalization to stabilize training while retaining phase information.

<claims>
1. A method for determining a state of a gating mechanism in a neural network, the method comprising: a) determining an immediately preceding state vector representing an immediately previous state of said gating mechanism; b) receiving an input vector; c) performing an element-wise multiplication between an update gate vector and a candidate state vector; d) performing an element-wise multiplication between a difference between 1 and said update gate vector and said immediately preceding state vector; e) adding a result of step c and step d to result in a current state vector representing said state of said gating mechanism; wherein said update gate vector is based on said input vector, said immediately preceding state vector, an update bias vector, and at least one weight matrix.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein said method is executed by a software module that forms part of said neural network.
3. The method according to claim 1, further comprising determining a state of a reset gate, said state of said reset gate being based on assessing an element-wise sigmoidal activation function on a sum of three elements, said three elements being: a complex valued matrix multiplication between said input vector and a first weight matrix; a complex valued matrix multiplication between said immediately preceding state vector and a second weight matrix; and a reset bias vector.
4. The method according to claim 1, further comprising determining a state of a modulation gate, said state of said modulation gate being based on assessing an activation function on a sum of three elements, said three elements being: a multiplication between said input vector and a third weight matrix; a multiplication between said immediately preceding state vector and a fourth weight matrix; and a modulation bias vector.
5. The method according to claim 4, wherein said activation function is one of: a sigmoid function; a softplus function; and a normalized exponential function.
6. A system for determining a current state of a gating mechanism in a neural network, the system comprising: a candidate module for determining a candidate state for said gating mechanism based on: an input vector, an immediately preceding state vector representing an immediately previous state of said gating mechanism, at least one candidate weight matrix, and a candidate bias vector; an update gate module for determining an update gate vector based on: said input vector; said immediately preceding state vector; an update bias vector; and at least one update weight matrix; wherein a result of said candidate module and a result of said update gate module are multiplied in an element-wise manner to result in a first intermediate product; a result of said update gate module and said immediately preceding state vector are multiplied in an element-wise manner to result in a second intermediate product; a sum of said first intermediate product and said second intermediate product results in said current state of said gating mechanism.
7. The system according to claim 6, further comprising a reset gate module for determining a reset gate vector, said reset gate vector being based on assessing a sigmoidal activation function on: said input vector; said immediately preceding state vector; a reset bias vector; and at least one reset weight matrix; and wherein said candidate state is further based on said reset gate vector.
8. The system according to claim 6, further comprising a modulation gate module for determining a modulation gate vector, said modulation gate vector being based on assessing an activation function on: said input vector; said immediately preceding state vector; a modulation bias vector; and at least one modulation weight matrix; and wherein said candidate state is further based on said modulation gate vector.
9. The system according to claim 8, wherein said activation function is one of: a sigmoid function; a softplus function; and a normalized exponential function.
