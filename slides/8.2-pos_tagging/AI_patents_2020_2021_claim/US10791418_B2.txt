Method and system for modeling user and location
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for determining a preference of a user for a location is provided. The preference of the user for the location is determined based on a plurality of users and a plurality of locations. The method includes determining a user-location relation based on a plurality of relations of the users with the locations, determining a plurality of POItags indicative of one or more properties of the plurality of locations, and determining a user-POItag relation based on the plurality of users and the plurality of POItags. The method also includes determining a location-POItag relation based on the plurality of locations and the plurality of POItags, and determining the preference of the user for the location based on at least one of the user-location relation, the user-POItag relation, and the location-POItag relation. The system includes a controller configured to perform the method. A vehicle including the system is also provided.

<claims>
1. A method for determining a preference of a user for a location, the method comprising the acts of: determining a user-location relation based on a plurality of relations of a plurality of users with a plurality of locations; determining a plurality of POItags indicative of one or more properties of the plurality of locations; determining a user-POItag relation based on the plurality of users and the plurality of POItags; determining a location-POItag relation based on the plurality of locations and the plurality of POItags; and determining the preference of the user for the location based on at least one of the user-location relation, the user-POItag relation, and the location-POItag relation, wherein the relation (rij) of the user (ui) with the location (li) is determined based on: rij=uT×lj., where ri,j represents a user and location interaction matrix.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the determining the user-POItag relation and/or the determining the location-POItag relation is based on a probabilistic matrix factorization model.
3. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: determining the locations based on a clustering of a plurality of geolocations.
4. The method according to claim 3, wherein each geolocation of the plurality of geolocations is indicative of a visit of a user of the plurality of users to a location of the plurality of locations.
5. The method according to claim 4, wherein each relation of the plurality of relations of the plurality of users with the plurality of the locations is determined based on a visit of a user of the plurality of users to a location of the plurality of locations.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the visit is determined based on: ri,j=f(visit_count(ui,lj)), where ri,j represents a user and location interaction matrix, and visit_count represents a number of visits of the user (ui) to the location (lj).
7. The method according to claim 6, wherein the relation (rij) of the user (ui) with the location (lj) is determined based on: rij=uT×lj., where ri,j represents a user and location interaction matrix.
8. The method according to claim 1, wherein each relation of the plurality of relations of the plurality of users with the plurality of the locations is determined based on a visit of a user of the plurality of users to a location of the plurality of locations.
9. The method according to claim 1, wherein the plurality of users, the plurality of locations, and/or the plurality of POItags include latent factors.
10. The method according to claim 9, wherein the latent factors are represented in semantic space.
11. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: normalizing parameter values indicative of each user of the plurality of users and/or normalizing parameter values indicative of each location of the plurality of locations.
12. The method according to claim 11, wherein the normalizing is based on a compression function: f(x)=√x.
13. The method according to claim 1, wherein one or more of the following acts are based on an estimation algorithm that is convex optimizable: the determining the plurality of POItags indicative of the one or more properties of the plurality of locations; the determining the user-POItag relation based on the plurality of users and the plurality of POItags; and the determining the location-POItag relation based on the plurality of locations and the plurality of POItags.
14. The method according to claim 13, wherein the determining is performed in semantic space.
15. A system for determining a preference of a user for a location, comprising: a controller configured for performing the method according to claim 1.
16. A vehicle comprising: a system according to claim 15.
