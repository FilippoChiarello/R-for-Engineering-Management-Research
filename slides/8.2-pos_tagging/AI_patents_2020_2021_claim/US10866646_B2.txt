<title>
Interactive media system and method
</title>

<abstract>
Interactive computing systems and methods are provided which enable simple and effective interaction with a user device, which increases interest and improves user experience. The interactive system comprises a user device including a motion sensor, for receiving motion-based gestures through motion of the user device; and a controller, coupled to the motion sensor, configured to control one or more aspects of the system according to the motion-based gestures. Advantageously, the system enables single handed operation of the user device.

<claims>
1. An interactive computing system comprising: a user device including a motion sensor, for receiving motion-based gestures through motion of the user device; a media player configured to play media, the media being associated with one or more selectable items by media control instructions and according to time points in the media; and a controller, coupled to the motion sensor, the controller configured to: control an interactive application of the user device according to the motion-based gestures, while the media player plays the media; and cause the interactive application to add at least one of the one or more selectable items to a list in response to the motion sensor receiving a motion-based gesture through motion of the user device while the media player plays the media and according to the association of the media with the one or more selectable items defined in the media control instructions and according to a time in the playback of the media.
2. The interactive computing system of claim 1, wherein the motion-based gestures comprise a plurality of predefined gestures.
3. The interactive computing system of claim 1, wherein the motion-based gestures are defined by local motion of the user device.
4. The interactive computing system of claim 1, wherein the motion-based gestures comprise one or a combination of: a left tilt, a right tilt, a forward tilt, a rear tilt, an inversion tilt, a circular tilt, a flip tilt, a twist, and a shake of the user device.
5. The interactive computing system of claim 1, further including an accelerometer, wherein the motion-based gestures are determined at least in part according to data from the accelerometer.
6. The interactive computing system of claim 1, further including a gyroscope, a compass or a positioning system, wherein the motion-based gestures are determined at least in part according to data from the gyroscope, the compass or the positioning system.
7. The interactive computing system of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to cause the interactive application to purchase an item, add an item to a digital shopping cart or wish list, place a bid on an item, complete a transaction, make a phone call, send an SMS, open another application, communicate with a further device, or call a function of another application.
8. The interactive computing system of claim 1, wherein the controller forms part of the user device.
9. The interactive computing system of claim 1, wherein the system consists of a handheld device.
10. The interactive computing system of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to control the interactive application of the user device while the media player is playing media in full screen on the user device.
11. The interactive computing system of claim 1, wherein the media comprises video.
12. The interactive computing system of claim 1, wherein the motion-based gestures include media control gestures and application control gestures, wherein the controller is configured to control playback of the playing media according to the media control gestures, and control the interactive application based upon the application control gestures.
13. The interactive computing system of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to selectively control the interactive application by receiving a first motion-based gesture and determining a first interactive application configuration in response thereto, and subsequently receiving a second motion-based gesture and determining a second interactive application configuration in response thereto.
14. The interactive computing system of claim 1, wherein the control of the interactive application is dynamically defined.
15. The interactive computing system of claim 14, wherein the control of the interactive application is dynamically defined according to when the motion-based gesture was received, or a state of the system at the time the gesture was received.
16. The interactive computing system of claim 1, wherein the control of the interactive application comprises a multi-dimensional navigation hierarchy defined using the motion-based gestures.
17. An interactive method comprising: receiving motion-based gestures through movement of a user device; playing media, the media being associated with one or more selectable items by media control instructions and according to time points in the media; controlling an interactive application of the user device based upon the motion-based gestures, while playing the media; and adding at least one of the one or more selectable items to a list in response to the motion sensor receiving a motion-based gesture through motion of the user device while the media player plays the media and according to the association of the media with the one or more selectable items defined in the media control instructions and according to a time in the playback of the media.
18. An interactive computing system comprising: a user device including a motion sensor, for receiving motion-based gestures through motion of the user device; a media player configured to play media, the media being segmented into a plurality of segments, wherein media control instructions are associated with each of the segments; and a controller, coupled to the motion sensor, the controller configured to control an interactive application of the user device while the media player plays the media, wherein the control of the interactive application is dependent upon a received motion-based gesture and media control instructions associated with a segment of the media being played at the time of receiving the motion based gesture.
