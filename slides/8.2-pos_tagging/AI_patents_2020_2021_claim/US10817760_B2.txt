<title>
Associating semantic identifiers with objects
</title>

<abstract>
Computing devices and methods for associating a semantic identifier with an object are disclosed. In one example, a three-dimensional model of an environment comprising the object is generated. Image data of the environment is sent to a user computing device for display by the user computing device. User input comprising position data of the object and the semantic identifier is received. The position data is mapped to a three-dimensional location in the three-dimensional model at which the object is located. Based at least on mapping the position data to the three-dimensional location of the object, the semantic identifier is associated with the object.

<claims>
1. A base computing device communicatively coupled to a user computing device, the base computing device comprising: a logic processor; and a storage device holding instructions executable by the logic processor to: generate a three-dimensional model of a physical environment, wherein the physical environment comprises a physical object that is not associated with a semantic identifier; send image data of the physical environment to the user computing device for display by the user computing device, wherein the image data comprises an object image of the physical object; receive from the user computing device user input comprising (1) position data of the physical object, wherein the position data is derived from a touch selection of the object image displayed on the user computing device, and (2) an initial semantic identifier, wherein the initial semantic identifier was not previously associated with the physical object; map the position data to a three-dimensional location in the three-dimensional model at which the physical object is located; and based at least on mapping the position data to the three-dimensional location of the physical object, associate the initial semantic identifier with the physical object.
2. The base computing device of claim 1, wherein the initial semantic identifier is derived from voice input provided with the touch selection.
3. The base computing device of claim 1, wherein receiving user input comprises receiving the image data from an image sensor of the base computing device, the image data indicating a user physically touching the physical object.
4. The base computing device of claim 1, wherein receiving user input comprises receiving the initial semantic identifier via audio captured by a microphone of the base computing device.
5. The base computing device of claim 1, wherein sending the image data of the physical environment to the user computing device comprises sending a video stream of the physical environment captured by an image sensor of the base computing device.
6. The base computing device of claim 1, wherein sending the image data of the physical environment to the user computing device comprises sending rendered images of the three-dimensional model of the physical environment to the user computing device.
7. The base computing device of claim 1, wherein sending the image data of the physical environment to the user computing device comprises sending a still image captured by an image sensor of the base computing device.
8. The base computing device of claim 1, wherein mapping the position data to a three-dimensional location in the three-dimensional model further comprises performing object recognition to determine that the physical object is a known object.
9. At a base computing device, a method for associating an initial semantic identifier with a physical object, the method comprising: generating a three-dimensional model of a physical environment, wherein the physical environment comprises the physical object, and wherein the physical object is not associated with a semantic identifier; sending image data of the physical environment to a user computing device for display by the user computing device, wherein the image data comprises an object image of the physical object; receiving from the user computing device user input comprising (1) position data of the physical object, wherein the position data is derived from a touch selection of the object image displayed on the user computing device, and (2) the initial semantic identifier, wherein the initial semantic identifier was not previously associated with the physical object; mapping the position data to a three-dimensional location in the three-dimensional model at which the physical object is located; and based at least on mapping the position data to the three-dimensional location of the physical object, associating the initial semantic identifier with the physical object.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the initial semantic identifier is derived from voice input provided with the touch selection.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein receiving user input comprises receiving the image data from an image sensor of the base computing device, the image data indicating a user physically touching the physical object.
12. The method of claim 9, wherein receiving user input comprises receiving the initial semantic identifier via audio captured by a microphone of the base computing device.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein sending the image data of the physical environment to the user computing device comprises sending a video stream of the physical environment captured by an image sensor of the base computing device.
14. The method of claim 9, wherein sending the image data of the physical environment to the user computing device comprises sending rendered images of the three-dimensional model of the physical environment to the user computing device.
15. The method of claim 9, wherein mapping the position data to a three-dimensional location in the three-dimensional model further comprises performing object recognition to determine that the physical object is a known object.
16. At a base computing device communicatively coupled to a user computing device, a method comprising: generating a three-dimensional model of a physical environment, wherein the physical environment comprises a physical object that is not associated with a semantic identifier; sending image data of the physical environment to the user computing device for display by the user computing device, wherein the image data comprises an object image of the physical object; receiving from the user computing device user input comprising (1) position data and (2) an initial semantic identifier, wherein the position data corresponds to a touch selection on the user computing device, and wherein the initial semantic identifier was not previously associated with the physical object; mapping the position data to a three-dimensional location in the three-dimensional model at which the physical object is located; and based at least on mapping the position data to the three-dimensional location of the physical object, associating the initial semantic identifier with the physical object.
