<title>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MULTI-BARRIER TRANSIENT ELECTROMAGNETIC (TEM) MEASUREMENTS
</title>

<abstract>
A computer- implemented method includes receiving a plurality of sensor signals (1202), each signal of the plurality of sensor signals being tagged with an associated time and depth. The method also includes selecting a baseline signal (1204). The method further includes comparing a selected sensor signal, of the plurality of sensor signals, to the baseline signal (1206). The method also includes determining a difference between the baseline signal and the selected sensor signal exceeds a threshold (1208). The method includes identifying, based at least in part on the difference, a feature of interest associated with the selected sensor signal (1216).

<claims>
1. A computerimplemented method, comprising:
receiving a plurality of sensor signals, each signal of the plurality of sensor signals being tagged with an associated time and depth (1102, 1202);
selecting a baseline signal (1104, 1204);
comparing a selected sensor signal, of the plurality of sensor signals, to the baseline signal (1206);
determining (1106, 1208) a difference between the baseline signal and the selected sensor signal exceeds a threshold; and
identifying, based at least in part on the difference, a feature of interest associated with the selected sensor signal (1120, 1216).
2. The computerimplemented method of claim 1, further comprising:
selecting a second sensor signal, of the plurality of sensor signals (1104, 1204);
comparing the second sensor signal to the baseline signal (1206);
determining a second difference between the baseline signal and the second sensor signal is below a threshold (1106, 1208); and
identifying additional sensor signals, of the plurality of sensor signals, the additional sensor signals having not been compared to the baseline signal (1210).
3. The computerimplemented method of claim 1, further comprising:
determining a direction associated with the feature of interest, the direction corresponding to an increase or a decrease of at least a portion of the selected signal value at a respective depth (1214); and
determining, based at least in part on the direction, whether the feature of interest corresponds to a material loss or a material addition.
4. The computerimplement of claim 1, wherein the baseline signal is at least one of a measured signal, a simulated signal, or a hybrid signal.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: determining a plurality of differences for a plurality of sensor signals compared to the baseline signal;
determining a start time and an end time for the plurality of sensor signals; and determining a severity of the feature of interest, based at least in part on the start time and the end time.
6. The computerimplemented method of claim 1, further comprising:
determining an identifying component, based at least in part on the difference, the identifying component corresponding to a material addition at an outer diameter of a tubular (1304).
7. A system for identifying a feature of interest in a wellbore, comprising:
a tool string (1604); and
a rotating tool section (1600), the rotating tool section being coupled to the tool string (1604), at an interface (1614), and comprising:
a coil array (1616), the coil array (1616) adapted to transmit electromagnetic signals into a formation;
a transmitter module (1620); and
a receiver module (1622);
wherein at least one of a shell (1906) of the rotating tool section (1600) or the coil array (1616) is rotatable about an axis of the tool string (1604) to provide an azimuthal resolution of the wellbore.
8. The system of claim 7, further comprising:
a motor (1606); and
a rotating gear (1610), the motor (1606) and the rotating gear (1610) driving rotation of at least one of the shell (1906) or the coil array (1616) independent of movement of the tool string (1604).
9. The system of claim 7, wherein the coil array (1906) comprises a composite sensor (1706), composite sensor (1706) including a core (1702) and at least two sets of coils (1704), the at least two sets of coils (1704) positioned about the core (1702) in different directions.
10. The system of claim 7, further comprising:
a plurality of coil arrays (1616), the coil array (1616) and the plurality of coil arrays (1616) arranged segmented about the axis of the tool string (1604).
