SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR VEHICLE HEADLIGHT CONTROL
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to systems, devices and methods for vehicle headlight control. In one embodiment, a method includes receiving image data from a front facing camera of the vehicle and detecting at least one object in the image data. An illumination level of the at least one object in the image data is detected and a control setting is determined to modify illumination of at least one lighting element of the vehicle, wherein the control setting is determined to increase an illumination level for the at least one object. The method also includes controlling the at least one lighting element of the vehicle in response to the control setting.Vehicle systems and devices are provided with a front facing camera and a control unit for a plurality of lighting elements wherein control settings may be modified based on objects detected in image data.

<claims>
1. A method for vehicle headlight control, the method comprising: receiving, by a control unit, image data from a front facing camera of the vehicle; detecting, by the control unit, at least one object in the image data; detecting, by the control unit, an illumination level of the at least one object in the image data; determining, by the control unit, a control setting to modify illumination of at least one lighting element of the vehicle, wherein the control setting is determined to increase an illumination level for the at least one object; and controlling, by the control unit, the least one lighting element of the vehicle in response to the control setting.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein object detection includes determining object position, wherein the illumination level relates to object brightness in the image data, and wherein the control setting is determined to increase an illumination level for the at least one object based on object position to increase brightness of a selection of captured image data.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein controlling includes adjusting a beam pattern of the at least one lighting element of the vehicle.
4. The method of any preceding claim, wherein object detection includes determining the object portion in three-dimensional space with respect to distance from the front facing camera of a vehicle.
5. The method of any preceding claim, wherein controlling the at least one lighting element of the vehicle is based on a detection area of the front facing camera, such that sections of the image data are associated with preconfigured lighting element settings.
6. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the image data is video data captured for a scene associated with the direction of travel of the vehicle.
7. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the at least one object includes one or more of a pedestrian, vehicle, barrier, person, roadway hazard, and roadway object.
8. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the illumination level relates to one or more of brightness and light distribution.
9. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the control setting modifies the angular position and direction of the at least one lighting element.
10. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the control setting modifies brightness and illumination activation of the at least one lighting element to increase illumination levels for a plurality of objects such that overall illumination of important objects are maximised.
11. The method of any preceding claim, wherein controlling includes activation of one or more illumination sources of vehicle lighting elements.
12. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the control setting relates to illumination of a section of capture image data and controlling includes control of one or more vehicle lighting elements to increase brightness for the section of captured image data.
13. A control unit for controlling at least one lighting element of a vehicle in response to a control setting, the control unit configured to perform the method of any preceding claim.
14. A vehicle comprising: a plurality of lighting elements; a front facing camera; and the control unit of claim 13.
15. A computer program product comprising a computer-readable storage medium including instructions that, when executed by the control unit of claim 13, cause the control unit to perform the method of any of claims 1 to 12.
