SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR BALANCING TIME RESOURCE ALLOCATION TO CELLULAR VEHICLE-TO-EVERYTHING (C-V2X) AND INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS (ITS-G5) OR DEDICATED SHORT RANGE COMMUNICATION (DSRC) DEPENDING ON USER CONFIGURATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
Some embodiments of this disclosure include systems, apparatuses, methods, and computer-readable media for use in a wireless network for balancing time resource allocation between cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) and intelligent transport systems (ITSG5)/ dedicated short range communication (DSRC). For example, some embodiments are directed to an electronic device including radio front end circuitry and processor circuitry coupled to the radio front end circuitry. The processor circuitry can be configured to monitor, using the radio front end circuitry, a channel for a time period and determine, based on the monitoring the channel, an average channel occupancy level (COL) of the channel over the time period. The processor circuitry can further be configured to compare the average COL to one or more thresholds and change a resource share of long-term evolution (LTE) cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) intervals based on the comparison.
