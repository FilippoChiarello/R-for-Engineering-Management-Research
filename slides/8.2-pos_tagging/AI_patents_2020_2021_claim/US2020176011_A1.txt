Distortion sensing, prevention, and distortion-aware bass enhancement
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods to provide distortion sensing, prevention, and/or distortion-aware bass enhancement in audio systems can be implemented in a variety of applications. Sensing circuitry can generate statistics based on an input signal received for which an acoustic output is generated. In various embodiments, the statistics can be used such that a multi-notch filter can be used to provide input to a speaker to generate the acoustic output. In various embodiments, the statistics from the sensing circuitry can be provided to a bass parameter controller coupled to bass enhancement circuitry to operatively provide parameters to the bass enhancement circuitry. The bass enhancement circuitry can provide a bass enhanced signal for generation of the acoustic output, based on the parameters. Various combinations of a multi-notch filter and bass enhancement circuitry using statistics from sensing circuitry can be implemented to provide an enhanced acoustic output. Additional apparatus, systems, and methods are disclosed.
