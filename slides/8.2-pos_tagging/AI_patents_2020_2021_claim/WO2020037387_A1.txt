SYSTEM FOR THE INSPECTION AND MONITORING OF MOVING PIPELINES
</title>

<abstract>
Comprising an inspection system based on the principle of laser measurement and computer vision, consisting of high definition cameras and laser projectors, which project dots and/or lines and/or laser meshes onto the outer surface of the riser cover and, based on alterations in the projected laser, it is possible to measure variations in the diameter, which are captured by cameras and analyzed by proprietary software, generating a warning for the operator, indicating some anomaly outside the tolerance, and which also foresees a monitoring system consisting of at least three high-definition cameras, positioned in such a way as to be able record the entire circumferential extent of the moving pipeline, its being possible to indicate the radial and longitudinal position in the pipeline from the recording of the image or the anomaly detected.

<claims>
1. SYSTEM FOR THE INSPECTION AND MONITORING OF MOVING PIPELINES, for dimensional inspection, based on the principle of laser measurement and computer vision, and the visual monitoring of the outer cover of the riser during the entry of the pipes into the vessel, characterized by the fact that it comprises a visualization and recording interface (1 ) connected, through cables (2), to the supports (3) of the inspection and monitoring systems, to which encoders (4) are connected which detect the movement of the pipelines (5).
2. SYSTEM, in accordance with claim 1 , characterized by the fact that the inspection equipment is composed of high-definition cameras (6) and laser projectors (7) on the outer surface of the riser cover.
3. SYSTEM, in accordance with claim 2, characterized by the fact that the laser projectors (7) can project dots, lines, crossed lines or knitting lasers onto the outer surface of the riser cover.
4. SYSTEM, in accordance with claim 1 , characterized by the fact that the monitoring equipment is composed of at least three high-definition cameras (6) positioned in such a way as to be able to record the entire circumferential extent of the piping in motion.
5. SYSTEM, in accordance with claim 1 , characterized by the fact that variation in the external diameter of the piping be measured based on alterations in the projected laser.
6. SYSTEM, in accordance with claim 5, characterized by the fact that the deviations in the laser projections are captured by the cameras (6).
7. SYSTEM, in accordance with claim 6, characterized by the fact that the recording of the images acquired by the cameras is obtained through the visualization and recording interface.
8. SYSTEM, in accordance with claim 7, characterized by the fact that the images generated are stored in HD, and can be transferred to mobile media and virtual disks.
9. SYSTEM, in accordance with claim 1 , characterized by the fact that the proprietary software performs the dimensional inspection of the external circumference of the moving piping, by obtaining the images from the cameras and reading the encoder, to identify the location of the laser projection, with the radial distance being calculated based on the distortion of the laser, which, if within the pre-established tolerance, determines the continuity of the execution of this routine of the system, until the occurrence of a result outside the pre-established tolerance is verified, when a warning is sent to the operator, and the information of the distance associated with the encoder is recorded.
10. SYSTEM, in accordance with claim 9, characterized by the fact that when the encoder fails to register the movement of the pipeline, the system is stopped, and a report is issued on the inspection carried out.
1 1 . SYSTEM, in accordance with claim 9, characterized by the fact that the proprietary software allows for the determination of the tolerable features.
