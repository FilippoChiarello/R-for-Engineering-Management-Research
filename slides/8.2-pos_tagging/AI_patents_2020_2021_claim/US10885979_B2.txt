<title>
Paired intercalation cells for drift migration
</title>

<abstract>
A method is presented for mitigating conductance drift in intercalation cells for neuromorphic computing. The method includes forming a first electro-chemical random access memory (ECRAM) structure over a substrate and forming a second ECRAM over the substrate, the first and second ECRAMs sharing a common contact. The common contact can be either a source contact or a drain contact. Each of the first and second ECRAMs can include a tungsten oxide layer, an electrolyte layer, and a gate contact.

<claims>
1. A method for mitigating conductance drift in intercalation cells for neuromorphic computing, the method comprising: forming a first electro-chemical random access memory (ECRAM) structure over a substrate; and forming a second ECRAM over the substrate, the first and second ECRAMs sharing a common contact disposed within one or more tungsten oxide layers.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the common contact is a drain contact.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the common contact is a source contact.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein each of the first and second ECRAMs includes a tungsten oxide layer of the one or more tungsten oxide layers, an electrolyte layer, and a gate contact.
