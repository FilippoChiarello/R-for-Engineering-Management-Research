VECTOR GENERATION FOR DISTRIBUTED DATA SETS
</title>

<abstract>
In various example embodiments, a vector modeling system is configured to access a set of data distributed across client devices and stored in a structured format. The vector modeling system determines vector parameters and vector templates suitable for the set of data and transforms the set of data from the structured format into a second format including one or more vectors based on one or more transformation strategies. The vector modeling system stores the transformed data and performs machine learning analysis on the vector.
