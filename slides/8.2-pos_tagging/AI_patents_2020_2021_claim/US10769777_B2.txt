Inspection device and inspection method
</title>

<claims>
1. An inspection device comprising a processor configured to execute a process, the process comprising: making an accept/reject testing on an inspection image through a first image inspection program in a group of image inspection programs including a plurality of learning-type image inspection programs of different generations, each of which satisfies a predetermined standard of fitness of the image inspection program with respect to a learning image; selecting a second image inspection program to correctly determine all misjudged images in the inspection images that have misrecognized, as a rejected image, based on a determined fitness from accuracy of the accept/reject testing of the learning-type image inspection programs and a margin size from a boundary separating acceptance and rejection: and replacing the first image inspection program with a-the second image inspection program in the group of image inspection programs which exhibits an optimum fitness with respect to the inspection image that has been misrecognized, when an operator makes the accept/reject testing on the inspection image that has undergone the accept/reject testing through the first image inspection program and finds the inspection image that has been misrecognized.
2. The inspection device according to claim 1, wherein the second image inspection program is selected from all the image inspection programs including the image inspection programs of past generations in the group of the image inspection programs.
3. An inspection method for making an accept/reject testing on an inspection image using an image inspection program, the inspection method comprising: making the accept/reject testing on the inspection image through a first image inspection program in a group of image inspection programs including a plurality of learning-type image inspection programs of different generations, each of which satisfies a predetermined standard of fitness of the image inspection program with respect to a learning image, by a processor; selecting a second image inspection program to correctly determine all misjudged images in the inspection images that have misrecognized, as a rejected image, based on a determined fitness from accuracy of the accept/reject testing of the learning-type image inspection programs and a margin size from a boundary separating acceptance and rejection, by the processor: and replacing the first image inspection program with a-the second image inspection program in the group of image inspection programs which exhibits an optimum fitness with respect to the inspection image that has been misrecognized, by the processor, when an operator makes the accept/reject testing on the inspection image that has undergone the accept/reject testing through the first image inspection program and finds the inspection image that has been misrecognized.
4. The inspection method according to claim 3, wherein the second image inspection program is selected from all the image inspection programs including the image inspection programs of past generations in the group of the image inspection programs, by the processor.
5. A non-transitory recording medium having stored therein an inspection program that makes an accept/reject testing on an inspection image using an image inspection program, the inspection program causing a computer to execute a process, the process comprising: making the accept/reject testing on the inspection image through a first image inspection program in a group of image inspection programs including a plurality of learning-type image inspection programs of different generations, each of which satisfies a predetermined standard of fitness of the image inspection program with respect to a learning image; selecting a second image inspection program to correctly determine all misjudged images in the inspection images that have misrecognized, as a rejected image, based on a determined fitness from accuracy of the accept/reject testing of the learning-type image inspection programs and a margin size from a boundary separating acceptance and rejection; and replacing the first image inspection program with a-the second image inspection program in the group of image inspection programs which exhibits an optimum fitness with respect to the inspection image that has been misrecognized, when an operator makes the accept/reject testing on the inspection image that has undergone the accept/reject testing through the first image inspection program and finds the inspection image that has been misrecognized.
6. The non-transitory recording medium having stored therein the inspection program according to claim 5, wherein the second image inspection program is selected from all the image inspection programs including the image inspection programs of past generations in the group of the image inspection programs.
