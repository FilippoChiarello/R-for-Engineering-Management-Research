<title>
Method and arrangement for determining an abnormal state of a system
</title>

<abstract>
A similarity between a pattern distribution of selected state patterns of system state descriptions in a first set of system state descriptions and an average pattern distribution of the selected state patterns of the system state descriptions in a second set of system state description is determined. The similarity is compared with a plurality of such similarities between the pattern distributions within the second set of system state descriptions and the average pattern distribution in the second set of system state descriptions. An abnormal state of the system is determined using this comparison.

<claims>
1. A method for determining an abnormal state of a system, wherein system states of the system are described using system state descriptions, the method comprising: determining, by a processor, a similarity between a pattern distribution of selected state patterns of the system state descriptions in a first set of system state descriptions and an average pattern distribution of the selected state patterns of the system state descriptions in a second set of system state descriptions, wherein the similarity is a statistical distance; comparing, by the processor, the determined similarity with a plurality of similarities between pattern distributions within the second set of system state descriptions and the average pattern distribution in the second set of system state descriptions; and determining, by the processor, the abnormal state of the system using the comparison.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the statistical distance is a Mahalanobis distance.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the first set of system state descriptions is a system state description time series of a first time period, the second set of system state descriptions is a system state description time series of a second time period, or a combination thereof.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the second time period is a multiple of the first time period, the first time period is a day, the second time period is a plurality of days, one or more weeks, or one or more months, or any combination thereof.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the comparing comprises comparing the determined similarity with the plurality of similarities using statistical distribution parameters.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the statistical distribution parameters include a mean value, a variance, or the mean value and the variance, which are determined for the plurality of similarities.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the comparing comprises comparing the determined similarity with the plurality of similarities using a predefinable sensitivity parameter.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the comparing comprises determining a comparison value for the plurality of the similarities.
9. The method of claim 6, wherein determining the comparison value comprises determining the comparison value using the mean value, the variance, the predefinable sensitivity parameter, or any combination thereof.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining and selecting a selected state pattern using a method of sequential pattern detection.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the method of sequential pattern detection comprises a "PrefixSpan" algorithm.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the selected state pattern is determined and selected from the system state descriptions in the second set of the system state descriptions.
13. The method of claim 1, further comprising creating a ranking of the selected state patterns having a frequency as the ranking criterion.
14. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining the average pattern distribution using at least one plurality of pattern distributions of the selected state patterns of the system state descriptions in the first set of the system state descriptions using an estimation.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein the system state descriptions in the second set of the system state descriptions are normal system states.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein the system state descriptions of the system are event log data items.
17. The method of claim 1, wherein the system state descriptions are described in the form of alphanumeric values assigned to event log data items.
18. The method of claim 1, wherein the system is a device, a machine, a plant, or a process running in a device, a plant, or a machine.
19. An arrangement for determining an abnormal state of a system, wherein system states of the system are described using system state descriptions, the arrangement comprising: a data processor configured to: determine a similarity between a pattern distribution of selected state patterns of the system state descriptions in a first set of system state descriptions and an average pattern distribution of the selected state patterns of the system state descriptions in a second set of system state descriptions, wherein the similarity is a statistical distance; compare the determined similarity with a plurality of similarities between the pattern distributions within the second set of system state descriptions and the average pattern distribution in the second set of system state descriptions; and determine an abnormal state of the system using the comparison.
