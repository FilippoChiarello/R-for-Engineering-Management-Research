Communications systems and methods for hydrogen fueling and electric charging
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for fueling (or charging) communication, for example between a hydrogen fueling station and a hydrogen powered vehicle (or an electric vehicle and charging station) may utilize near field communication as well as vehicle to infrastructure communication. Safety information, fueling or charging information, payment information, and other information may be transmitted, and the redundant nature of the communication permits fault recovery and improved process monitoring. In this manner, fueling and/or recharging is made safer, faster, and more efficient.

<claims>
1. A method for communication between a hydrogen fueling station and a hydrogen powered vehicle, the method comprising: disposing a nozzle of the station within a specified distance of a receptacle on the vehicle to establish, via a first near field communication (NFC) hardware disposed proximate the nozzle and a second NFC hardware disposed proximate the receptacle, an NFC link therebetween; communicating to the station, via the NFC link, identifying information for the vehicle and a static information of a fueling system of the vehicle, wherein the fueling system comprises a first hydrogen tank and a second hydrogen tank; selecting, by the station and after establishing the NFC link, a vehicle to infrastructure (V2X) communication network based on the identifying information for the vehicle; establishing, between the station and the vehicle, a V2X communication link via the V2X communication network; transmitting, via the V2X communication network, an initial dynamic data of the fueling system comprising an initial pressure of the first hydrogen tank, an initial pressure of the second hydrogen tank, an initial temperature of the first hydrogen tank, and an initial temperature of the second hydrogen tank, delivering through the nozzle, by the station and to the vehicle via the receptacle, pressurized hydrogen to the fueling system to at least partially fill the first hydrogen tank and the second hydrogen tank; monitoring, via the V2X communication network and during the delivering pressurized hydrogen, one or more dynamic data for the first hydrogen tank and the second hydrogen tank.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising stopping, by the station, delivery of hydrogen to the vehicle in response to an indication that a vehicle hydrogen tank temperature is out of bounds or a vehicle hydrogen tank pressure is out of bounds.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the delivering the pressurized hydrogen between the vehicle and the station and in connection with the NFC link and the V2X link is rated at an ASIL D level of safety.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising communicating, via the NFC link, one or more of: a fueling protocol identifier; a vehicle identification number, a vehicle hydrogen tank volume, a vehicle hydrogen tank type receptacle type, a fueling command, a maximum mass flow of hydrogen between the nozzle and the receptacle, or a watchdog counter.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising transmitting to the vehicle, by the station and over the V2X communication link, an update to at least one of: a software application operative on the vehicle; or firmware for an electronic device operative as part of the vehicle.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising exchanging, between the station and the vehicle and over the V2X communication link, payment information and confirmation associated with the delivering the pressurized hydrogen to the vehicle.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising downloading from the vehicle, to the station and over the V2X communication link, diagnostic information for a component of the vehicle.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising, responsive to an interruption in communication over one of the V2X communication link or the NFC link, completing delivery of pressurized hydrogen through the nozzle in accordance with a default delivery protocol associated with the first hydrogen tank or the second hydrogen tank.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein communication between the station and the vehicle via the NFC link is conducted in accordance with at least one of IEC standard 61784 or IEC standard 61508.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising updating, responsive to the monitoring and in a database accessible to the station, at least one characteristic of a default fueling protocol for the vehicle.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein a communication protocol of the V2X communication link is at least one of an IEEE 802.11 protocol, a 4G LTE mobile network protocol, or a 5G mobile network protocol.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the first NFC hardware is replaceable without impairing the hydrogen delivery function of the nozzle.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the delivering pressurized hydrogen at least partially fills the first hydrogen tank and the second hydrogen tank of the vehicle simultaneously.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein, during the delivering pressurized hydrogen, the station polls the vehicle for information regarding the first hydrogen tank or the second hydrogen tank at an interval of 50 milliseconds or less.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein the first NFC hardware and the second NFC hardware are rated for use in a Zone 1 hydrogen classified area.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein the specified distance is 20 centimeters or less.
17. The method of claim 1, wherein the static information of the fueling system of the vehicle comprises, for each of the first hydrogen tank and the second hydrogen tank, information regarding tank volume, pressure rating, material information, dimensional information including length, diameter, and wall thickness, serial number, and last service date.
18. The method of claim 10, wherein the at least one characteristic comprises a target pressure and a ramp rate.
