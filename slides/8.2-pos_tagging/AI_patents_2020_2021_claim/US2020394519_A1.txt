METHOD FOR OPERATING AN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
A method for operating an artificial neural network is provided, including at least one convolution layer that is configured to convert an input matrix of the convolution layer into an output matrix, based on a convolution operation and a shift operation. The method includes ascertaining at least one first normalization value and one second normalization value based on inputs of the input matrix and/or based on a training data set, ascertaining a modified filter matrix based on an original filter matrix and based on at least one of the first normalization value and the second normalization value, and ascertaining a modified shift matrix based on an original shift matrix and based on at least one of the first normalization value and the second normalization value. The method further includes converting the input matrix into the output matrix by applying the modified filter matrix and the modified shift matrix.
