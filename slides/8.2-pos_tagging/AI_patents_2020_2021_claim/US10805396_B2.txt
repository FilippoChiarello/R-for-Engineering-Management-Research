<title>
Method and apparatus for biologically inspired autonomous infrastructure monitoring
</title>

<abstract>
A method and apparatus are provided for autonomously detecting and reporting anomalies in actions of an autonomous mobile node, or in behaviors of a swarm of autonomous mobile nodes to an operator. The autonomous mobile node may experience anomalies or unexpected situations due to various failures or external influence (e.g. natural weather phenomena, enemy threats). During a training phase a prediction model and a structured model may be established from measurement data received from one or more sensors of an autonomous mobile node or a swarm of nodes while executing an action or behavior under normal circumstances. A prediction model forecasts the expected outcome of an action or behavior, and structured model helps quantify the similarity of a learned action or behavior to the currently observed situation. Based on the measurement data applicable models can be used for an action or behavior for anomaly detection in the action or behavior.

<claims>
1. A system for autonomously monitoring behavior of a plurality of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), the system comprising: an initial prediction model for an action of the plurality of UAVs based upon synthetically generated data regarding the plurality of UAVs; a processor configured to: receive measurement data from a plurality of sensors onboard the plurality of UAVs or external to the UAVs, the measurement data relating to the action of the plurality of UAVs when the plurality of UAVs perform the action; determine a prediction model for the action of the plurality of UAVs, based on the initial prediction model and the measurement data from the plurality of sensors, onboard the plurality of UAVs or external to the UAVs; determine a corresponding structured model about the action of the plurality of UAVs based on the prediction model applied to the measurement data from the plurality of sensors, the corresponding structured model including statistical probabilities of being a particular state and transitioning to another; based on the corresponding structured model, detect anomaly in the action of the plurality of UAVs; determine whether there is a surprise between present observation data and expected observation data relating to the action of the plurality of UAVs based on the corresponding structured model; and when it is determined that there is a surprise, update the prediction model through surprise analysis and/or rule maintenance to improve future predictions.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to update the prediction model until the surprise is within a predefined acceptable threshold.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the action of the plurality of UAVs comprises a sequence of predefined actuator commands executed by the plurality of UAVs.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the behavior of the plurality of UAVs is a collection of actions issued to the plurality of UAVs to accomplish a specific goal.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the measurement data includes at least identification information, role information of the plurality of UAVs, and a state of the plurality of UAVs.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: upon detecting the anomaly in the action of the plurality of UAVs, send an alert indicating the anomaly in the action of the plurality of UAVs, via a tentacle comprising a communication device, to an operator.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the corresponding structured model includes a validity of observed state or state sequences with respect to a predicted state or state sequences using a similarity metric.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the prediction model includes one or more prediction rules each configured to inform how data from relevant sensors should change when an action of the plurality of UAVs is executed.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein each prediction rule includes learned information about the action of the plurality of UAVs based on the received measurement data from the plurality of sensors.
