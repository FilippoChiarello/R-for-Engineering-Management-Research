SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR IMPROVED AIRCRAFT SAFETY
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and system for improved aircraft safety are described herein. A machine learning model may be trained using historical flight data for a number of previously flown flights where an automation function autonomously disengaged. The trained machine learning model may be used to generate probabilistic alert rules. The probabilistic alert rules may be used by a computing device onboard an aircraft to provide contextual information to flight crew relating to engagement status for one or more automation functions of the aircraft.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving, at a computing device, historical flight data for a plurality of flight records, wherein each flight record of the plurality of flight records comprises a plurality of flight attributes; determining, based on the plurality of flight attributes for each flight record of the plurality of flight records and a machine learning model, one or more flight attributes associated with at least one autonomous configuration change; and generating, based on the one or more flight attributes associated with the at least one autonomous configuration change, a plurality of probabilistic alert rules.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein each flight record of the plurality of flight records is associated with a controlled flight into stall incident.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one autonomous configuration change is associated with one or more of an autopilot system, an autothrottle system, or a flight guidance system.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving current flight data for an aircraft in-flight, wherein the current flight data comprises a second plurality of flight attributes and an indication of a current autonomous configuration change.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising causing, based on the indication of the current autonomous configuration change, an alert to be provided at a graphical interface of the aircraft in-flight.
6. The method of claim 4, further comprising determining, based on the second plurality of flight attributes and the plurality of probabilistic alert rules, a probability that the current autonomous configuration change was erroneous.
7. The method of claim 4, further comprising determining, based on the second plurality of flight attributes and the plurality of probabilistic alert rules, a probability that a next autonomous configuration change will occur.
8. A method comprising: receiving, at a computing device, flight data for an aircraft in-flight, wherein the flight data comprises a plurality of flight attributes and an indication of a current autonomous configuration change; determining, based on the plurality of flight attributes and at least one of a plurality of probabilistic alert rules, a probability that the current autonomous configuration change was erroneous; and causing an alert comprising the probability to be provided at a graphical interface of the aircraft in-flight.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the current autonomous configuration change is associated with one or more of an autopilot system, an autothrottle system, or a flight guidance system.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the alert comprises an indication that the current autonomous configuration change is associated with one or more of the autopilot system, the autothrottle system, or the flight guidance system.
11. The method of claim 8, further comprising receiving historical flight data for a plurality of flight records, wherein each flight record of the plurality of historical flight records comprises a plurality of historical flight attributes.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising determining, based on the plurality of historical flight attributes for each flight record of the plurality of flight records and a machine learning model, one or more historical flight attributes associated with the current autonomous configuration change.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising generating, based on the one or more historical flight attributes associated with the current autonomous configuration change, the plurality of probabilistic alert rules.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein each flight record of the plurality of historical flight records is associated with a controlled flight into stall incident.
15. A method comprising: receiving, at a computing device, flight data for an aircraft in-flight, wherein the flight data comprises a plurality of flight attributes and an indication of a current autonomous configuration change; determining, based on the flight data and at least one of a plurality of probabilistic alert rules, a probability that a next autonomous configuration change will occur in-flight; and causing an alert comprising the probability to be provided at a graphical interface of the aircraft in-flight.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the current autonomous configuration change is associated with one or more of an autopilot system, an autothrottle system, or a flight guidance system.
17. The method of claim 15, wherein the alert comprises an indication that the next autonomous configuration change is associated with one or more of an autopilot system, an autothrottle system, or a flight guidance system.
18. The method of claim 15, further comprising receiving historical flight data for a plurality of flight records, wherein each flight record of the plurality of historical flight records comprises a plurality of historical flight attributes and is associated with a controlled flight into stall incident.
19. The method of claim 18, further comprising determining, based on the plurality of historical flight attributes for each flight record of the plurality of flight records and a machine learning model, one or more historical flight attributes associated with the next autonomous configuration change.
20. The method of claim 19, further comprising generating, based on the one or more historical flight attributes associated with the next autonomous configuration change, the plurality of probabilistic alert rules.
