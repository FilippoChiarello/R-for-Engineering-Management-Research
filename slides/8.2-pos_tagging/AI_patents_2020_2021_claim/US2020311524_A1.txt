SYNAPSE-INSPIRED MEMORY ELEMENT FOR NEUROMORPHIC COMPUTING
</title>

<abstract>
Various embodiments of the present disclosure are directed towards a memory device including a first memory element and a second memory element. The memory device includes a substrate and a bottom electrode disposed over the substrate. The first memory element is disposed between the bottom electrode and a top electrode, such that the first memory element has a first area. A second memory element is disposed between the bottom electrode and the top electrode. The second memory element is laterally separated from the first memory element by a non-zero distance. The second memory element has a second area different than the first area.
