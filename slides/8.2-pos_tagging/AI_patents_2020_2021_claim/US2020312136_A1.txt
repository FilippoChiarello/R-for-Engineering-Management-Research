<title>
VERIFYING IDENTITY OF AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE DURING OPERATION
</title>

<abstract>
A method includes: receiving, by a computing device of a first vehicle, a command from a host device; in response to receiving the command, storing a new device secret in memory; generating, by the computing device using the new device secret, a triple comprising an identifier, a certificate, and a public key; and sending, by the computing device, the triple to a second vehicle, where the second vehicle is configured to verify an identity of the first vehicle using the triple.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving, by a computing device of a first vehicle, a command from a host device; in response to receiving the command, storing a new device secret in memory; generating, by the computing device using the new device secret, a triple comprising an identifier, a certificate, and a public key; and sending, by the computing device, the triple to a second vehicle, wherein the second vehicle is configured to verify an identity of the first vehicle using the triple.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the new device secret is: received from the host device; or generated by the computing device after receiving the command from the host device.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the new device secret is associated with a predetermined status or class of the first vehicle.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the second vehicle is configured to perform an action in response to verifying the identity of the first vehicle.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the action is at least one of presenting an alert on a user display of the second vehicle, changing a path of navigation or speed of the second vehicle, or activating a brake system of the second vehicle.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising sending, by the computing device, the triple to a traffic control system, wherein the traffic control system is configured to: verify the identity of the first vehicle using the triple; and in response to verifying the identity of the first vehicle, change a state of the traffic control system to allow passage of the first vehicle.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the new device secret replaces, in the memory, a previously-stored device secret.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising storing a secret key used to communicate with the host device, wherein the secret key is used as an input to a message authentication code to generate the new device secret.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the command is authenticated using the secret key, the method further comprising sending, by the computing device to the host device, a confirmation that the new device secret has been stored.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising, after the second vehicle has verified the identity of the first vehicle: encrypting, by the computing device using a private key, a message, wherein the private key and the public key are an associated pair generated using the new device secret; and sending, by the computing device, the encrypted message to the second vehicle, wherein the encrypted message includes a freshness.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the message includes configuration data, the second vehicle is configured to perform an action in response to receiving the message, and the action is performed by the second vehicle in conformance with the configuration data.
12. A system for use in a first vehicle, the system comprising: at least one processor; and memory containing instructions configured to instruct the at least one processor to: receive a command from a host device; in response to receiving the command, store a new device secret; generate, using the new device secret, a certificate; and send the certificate to a second vehicle, wherein the second vehicle is configured to verify an identity of the first vehicle using the certificate.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the new device secret is: received from the host device; or generated by the system after receiving the command from the host device.
14. The system of claim 12, further comprising memory storing a secret key for communications with the host device, wherein the instructions are further configured to instruct the at least one processor to use the secret key as an input to a message authentication code to generate the new device secret.
15. The system of claim 12, wherein the second vehicle is configured to perform an action in response to verifying the identity of the first vehicle, and wherein the action is at least one of presenting an alert on a user display of the second vehicle, changing a path of navigation or speed of the second vehicle, or activating a brake system of the second vehicle.
16. The system of claim 12, wherein the new device secret is associated with a predetermined status or class of the first vehicle.
17. A non-transitory computer storage medium storing instructions which, when executed on a computing device of a first vehicle, cause the computing device to at least: receive a command from a host device; in response to receiving the command, store a new device secret in memory; generate, using the new device secret, a triple comprising an identifier, a certificate, and a public key; and send the triple to a second vehicle, wherein the second vehicle is configured to verify the identity of the first vehicle using the triple.
18. The non-transitory computer storage medium of claim 17, wherein storing the new device secret in memory comprises replacing a previously-stored device secret with the new device secret, and wherein the instructions further cause the computing device to send the identifier to the host device.
19. The non-transitory computer storage medium of claim 17, wherein: the identifier is a public identifier, and a first asymmetric generator generates the public identifier and a private identifier as an associated pair; and a second asymmetric generator generates the public key and a private key as an associated pair.
20. The non-transitory computer storage medium of claim 19, wherein generating the triple comprises: receiving a message from the host device; concatenating the message with the public key to provide first data; encrypting the first data using the private identifier to provide second data; and encrypting the second data using the private key to provide the certificate.
