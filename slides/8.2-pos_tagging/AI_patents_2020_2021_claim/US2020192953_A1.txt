METHOD OF AND SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING A NEXT STATE FOR A RECOMMENDATION BLOCK TO BE DISPLAYED IN WEB BROWSER
</title>

<abstract>
A method of determining a next state for a recommendation block to be displayed by a browser application. The method includes, by a server, receiving an indication of the web resource and of supplemental content to be displayed, determining a plurality of features associated with the web resource, executing a Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA) based on the plurality of features to determine a confidence level parameter and based thereon selecting a lookup table out of a plurality of different lookup tables. The selected lookup table is sent to the browser application. The browser application processes the lookup table to determine a next state of the recommendation block and display the recommendation block containing the supplemental content in the next state outputted by the selected lookup table.

2. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of features includes data representative of a plurality of prior user actions by which the user had interacted with the web resource via the browser application, at least some of the plurality of prior user actions having caused recommendation blocks to be displayed via the browser application.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of features includes a plurality of features of the web resource.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the MLA had been trained based on user interactions with training recommendation blocks and based on features associated with training web resources that were accessed by users to be presented with respective ones of the training recommendation blocks.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein: the sending, by the server, to the browser application the selected lookup table is in response to the server receiving an indication of a user action executed in the browser application; and the selected lookup table is configured to be processed by the browser application to determine the indication of the next state of the recommendation block by the browser application inputting into the selected lookup table the indication of the user action and the current state of the recommendation block.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the user action is at least any one of: a back scroll, a scrolling action, a gesture inputted into a touch sensitive input device, an actuation of at least one key of a keyboard, and an actuation of at least one button of a mouse, a scrolling action reaching an end of a displayed page of the web resource.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein: the plurality of different lookup tables includes: a first lookup table corresponding to a first confidence level of the plurality of different confidence level ranges, and a second lookup table corresponding to a second confidence level of the plurality of different confidence level ranges, the second confidence level being higher than the first confidence level; and the recommendation block is more prominent: when displayed on the display in the particular next state of the recommendation block determined by the second lookup table based on a given combination of the current state of the recommendation block and the user action, when compared to being displayed on the display in the particular next state of the recommendation block determined by the first lookup table based on the same given combination of the current state of the recommendation block and the user action.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the current state of the recommendation block is one of a visual state and a virtual state, the recommendation block being invisible on the display when the recommendation block is in the virtual state.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of different possible current states of the recommendation block comprises a visual state of the recommendation block and a virtual state of the recommendation block, the virtual state being defined such that the recommendation block is invisible on the display when displayed by the browser application in any virtual state of the at least one virtual state
10. The method claim 9, further comprising: after the sending by the server to the browser application the selected lookup table, receiving at the server an indication of the user having viewed the supplemental content via the recommendation block displayed by the browser application using the selected lookup table; and in response to the receiving the indication of the user having viewed the supplemental content, changing the current state of the recommendation block to a given virtual state of the recommendation block, the plurality of different possible current states of each lookup table of the plurality of different lookup tables including the given virtual state of the recommendation block.
11. The method claim 10, wherein the plurality of different possible next states of the recommendation block comprises at least one visual state of the recommendation block and at least one virtual state of the recommendation block.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein: the confidence level indicated by the determined confidence level parameter is a probability that the supplemental content will be of interest to the user; and the selecting the lookup table out of the plurality of different lookup tables is in executed by the server in response to determining, by the server, that the probability indicated by the determined confidence level parameter exceeds a pre-defined probability threshold.
13. A server for causing a browser application of an electronic device to display on a display of the electronic device a recommendation block in a next state of the recommendation block, the recommendation block being in a current state prior to being displayed on the display in the next state, the browser application displaying a web resource on the display, the server being communicatively connectable to the electronic device and comprising: a processor; and a non-transient memory communicatively connected to the processor, the non-transient memory storing instructions that when executed by the processor, cause the server to: receive an indication of the web resource and an indication of supplemental content to be displayed on the display via the recommendation block in association with the web resource; receive an indication of a plurality of features associated with at least the part of the web resource; execute a Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA) based on the plurality of features to determine a confidence level parameter, the confidence level parameter being indicative of a confidence level that the supplemental content will be of interest to the user; select, based on the confidence level parameter, a lookup table to be sent to the electronic device, the lookup table being one of a plurality of different lookup tables accessible by the server, each lookup table of the plurality of different lookup tables: corresponding to one confidence level range of a plurality of different confidence level ranges accessible by the server, comprising a plurality of different possible user actions and a plurality of different possible current states of the recommendation block as possible inputs for generating an output, and a plurality of different possible next states of the recommendation block as possible outputs based on the possible inputs, and correlating each particular combination of a given current state of the plurality of different possible current states and a given user action of the plurality of different possible user actions to one next state of the plurality of different next states; and send to the browser application the selected lookup table, the selected lookup table being configured to be processed by the browser application to: determine an indication of the next state of the recommendation block of the plurality of different possible next states of the recommendation block, and display the recommendation block containing the supplemental content on the display in the next state of the recommendation block outputted by the selected lookup table.
14. The server of claim 13, wherein the selected lookup table is configured to be processed by the browser application by the browser application: inputting into the selected lookup table a combination of: (i) an indication of a user action executed in the browser application while the recommendation block is in the current state, and (ii) the current state of the recommendation block; and receiving from the selected lookup table the next state of the recommendation block as output in response to the inputting.
