LANE CHANGE CONTROL DEVICE AND METHOD FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
A lane change control device and a method for an autonomous vehicle improve safety and accuracy in changing lanes on a road. In particular, the lane change control device includes: a learning device that learns an environment in which the autonomous vehicle is able to change lanes on a road; and a controller that controls a lane change of the autonomous vehicle, based on a learned result of the learning device.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A lane change control device of an autonomous vehicle, comprising: a learning device configured to learn an environment in which the autonomous vehicle is able to make a lane change; and a controller configured to control the lane change of the autonomous vehicle, based on a learned result of the learning device.
2. The lane change control device of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to control the lane change of the autonomous vehicle, considering whether a rearward vehicle travelling in a target lane yields to the autonomous vehicle, even when it is determined that the autonomous vehicle is able to make the lane change.
3. The lane change control device of claim 2, wherein the controller is configured to stop the autonomous vehicle and re-determine whether the autonomous vehicle is able to make the lane change when the rearward vehicle does not yield to the autonomous vehicle during the lane change of the autonomous vehicle.
4. The lane change control device of claim 3, wherein the controller is configured to determine that the rearward vehicle yields to the autonomous vehicle when a speed of the rearward vehicle is reduced, and the controller is configured to determine that the rearward vehicle does not yield to the autonomous vehicle when the speed of the rearward vehicle is maintained or increased.
5. The lane change control device of claim 4, wherein the controller is configured to determine whether the rearward vehicle yields to the autonomous vehicle, additionally considering whether signal lamps of the rearward vehicle flash on and off.
6. The lane change control device of claim 1, wherein the learning device is configured to consider a case where a rearward vehicle travelling in a target lane yields to the autonomous vehicle as the environment in which the autonomous vehicle is able to make the lane change.
7. The lane change control device of claim 1, wherein the learning device is configured to learn the environment in which the autonomous vehicle is able to make the lane change, by receiving an input of at least one of speeds of a forward vehicle and a rearward vehicle that are travelling in a target lane, whether signal lamps of the forward vehicle flash on and off, whether brake lamps of the forward vehicle light up, whether signal lamps of the rearward vehicle flash on and off, or a heading angle of the autonomous vehicle.
8. The lane change control device of claim 1, wherein the learning device learns based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
9. A lane change control method for an autonomous vehicle, comprising: learning, by a learning device, an environment in which the autonomous vehicle is able to make a lane change; and controlling, by a controller, the lane change of the autonomous vehicle based on a learned result of the learning device.
10. The lane change control method of claim 9, wherein controlling of the lane change of the autonomous vehicle includes: controlling the lane change of the autonomous vehicle, considering whether a rearward vehicle travelling in a target lane yields to the autonomous vehicle, even when it is determined that the autonomous vehicle is able to make the lane change.
11. The lane change control method of claim 10, wherein controlling of the lane change of the autonomous vehicle further includes: stopping the autonomous vehicle and re-determining whether the autonomous vehicle is able to make the lane change, when the rearward vehicle does not yield to the autonomous vehicle during the lane change of the autonomous vehicle.
12. The lane change control method of claim 11, wherein re-determining of whether the autonomous vehicle is able to make the lane change includes: determining that the rearward vehicle yields to the autonomous vehicle, when a speed of the rearward vehicle is reduced; and determining that the rearward vehicle does not yield to the autonomous vehicle, when the speed of the rearward vehicle is maintained or increased.
13. The lane change control method of claim 11, wherein determining that the rearward vehicle yields to the autonomous vehicle includes: determining that the rearward vehicle yields to the autonomous vehicle, when it is detected that signal lamps of the rearward vehicle flash on and off while a speed of the rearward vehicle is reduced.
14. The lane change control method of claim 9, wherein learning of the environment includes: considering a case where a rearward vehicle travelling in a target lane yields to the autonomous vehicle as the environment in which the autonomous vehicle is able to make the lane change.
15. The lane change control method of claim 9, wherein learning of the environment includes: learning the environment in which the autonomous vehicle is able to make the lane change, by receiving an input of at least one of speeds of a forward vehicle and a rearward vehicle that are travelling in a target lane, whether signal lamps of the forward vehicle flash on and off, whether brake lamps of the forward vehicle light up, whether signal lamps of the rearward vehicle flash on and off, or a heading angle of the autonomous vehicle.
16. The lane change control method of claim 9, wherein the learning of the environment is performed based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
