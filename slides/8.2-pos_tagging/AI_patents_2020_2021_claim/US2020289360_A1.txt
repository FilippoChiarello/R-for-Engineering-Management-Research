APPARATUS AND METHODS FOR ASSISTING BREATHING
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention provides, among other things, apparatus and methods of use for treating a subject in need of assistance with breathing. In some embodiments the subject suffers from airflow obstruction. In some embodiments, the subject suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of treating a subject comprising: (a) sensing when a subject is exhaling; and (b) delivering a stimulus to the subject's thorax or abdomen during at least part of the expiratory phase of breathing in response to said sensing, so as to assist the subject with exhalation.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein performing the method decreases the subject's end expiratory lung volume (EELV) as compared with the subject's EELV when unassisted.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject suffers from a disorder that impairs exhalation.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject has an abnormally high EELV in the absence of the stimulus.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject suffers from dynamic hyperinflation in the absence of the stimulus.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein step (a) comprises detecting respiratory movement of the subject's thorax or abdomen.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein step (a) comprises detecting respiratory movement of the subject's thorax or abdomen using inductive plethysmography.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein step (a) comprises detecting respiratory movement of the subject's thorax or abdomen using a strain gauge.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the sensor is incorporated into an adhesive patch suitable for placement on the subject's skin.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the sensing occurs externally to the subject.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the stimulus is delivered externally to the subject.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the sensing occurs externally to the subject and the stimulus is delivered externally to the subject.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the sensor, device, or both are incorporated into a garment or belt.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein the sensor and the device are incorporated into the same garment or belt.
16. The method of claim 1, wherein step (b) comprises delivering electrical stimulation to one or more muscles of expiration and/or to efferent nerve(s) supplying one or more muscles of expiration, wherein said stimulus is sufficient to cause contraction of said muscle(s) or increase the expiratory force generated by said muscle(s).
17. The method of claim 1, wherein step (b) comprises delivering electrical stimulation to one or more abdominal muscles.
18. The method of claim 1, wherein step (b) comprises delivering electrical stimulation to the rectus abdominis muscle.
19. The method of claim 1, wherein step (b) comprises delivering electrical stimulation to one or more lower internal intercostal muscles of the anterior thorax.
20. The method of claim 1, wherein step (b) comprises mechanically compressing the subject's abdomen or lower anterior thorax.
21. 21-78. (canceled)
