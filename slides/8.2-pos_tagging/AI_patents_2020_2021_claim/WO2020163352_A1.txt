<title>
COMPUTER-ASSISTED ARTHROPLASTY SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method for creating an activity-optimized cutting guides for surgical procedures includes receiving one or more pre-operative images depicting one or more anatomical joints of a patient, and creating a three-dimensional anatomical model of the one or more anatomical joints based on the one or more pre-operative images. One or more patient-specific anatomical measurements are determined based on the three-dimensional anatomical model. A statistical model of joint performance is applied to the patient-specific anatomical measurements to identify one or more cut angles for performing a surgical procedure. A patient-specific cutting guide is created that comprises one or more apertures positioned based on the one or more cut angles.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A computer-implemented method for creating an activity-optimized cutting guide for a surgical procedure, the method comprising:
receiving one or more pre-operative images depicting one or more anatomical joints of a patient;
creating a three-dimensional anatomical model of the one or more anatomical joints based on the one or more pre-operative images;
determining one or more patient-specific anatomical measurements based on the three-dimensional anatomical model;
applying a statistical model of joint performance to the one or more patient-specific anatomical measurements;
identifying one or more cut angles for performing a surgical procedure based on the application of the statistical model; and
creating a patient-specific cutting guide comprising one or more apertures positioned based on the one or more cut angles.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more patient-specific anatomical measurements comprise distal and anterior condyle radii measurements.
3. The method of any of claims 1 and 2, wherein identifying one or more cut angles comprises identifying one or more cut angles that provide balanced condylar gaps throughout a range of motion associated with one or more physical activities.
4. The method of any of claims 1-3, further comprising generating the statistical model by:
selecting a plurality of implants, wherein each implant is defined by a distinct set of implantation features;
populating a database of simulation results by simulating a motion of a plurality of joint geometries while performing one or more physical activities and an expected stress on the plurality of implants resulting from the motion; and
generating the statistical model of joint performance based on the simulation results.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the implantation features comprise one or more of an implant position, an implant orientation, and an implant type.
6. The method of any of claims 1-5, wherein the statistical model of joint performance comprises a plurality of transfer functions.
7. The method of any of claims 1-6, wherein applying the statistical model of joint performance to the one or more patient-specific anatomical measurements comprises:
applying a Monte Carlo method to iteratively evaluate a plurality of possible cut angles, wherein each iteration of the Monte Carlo method applies the one or more transfer functions with a distinct set of parameters.
8. The method of any of claims 1-7, wherein the statistical model of joint performance is a machine learning model.
9. The method of any of claims 1-8, wherein creating the patient-specific cutting guide comprises:
modifying a computer model of a cutting guide blank to include the one or more apertures; and
providing the computer model of the modified cutting guide blank to a device configured to manufacture the patient-specific cutting guide based on the computer model.
10. A system for creating an activity-optimized cutting guide for a surgical procedure, the system comprising:
a database comprising one or more pre-operative images of one or more anatomical joints of a patient; and
a computing system comprising one or more processors configured to:
create a three-dimensional anatomical model of the one or more anatomical joints based on the one or more pre-operative images,
determine one or more patient-specific anatomical measurements based on the three-dimensional anatomical model,
apply a statistical model of joint performance to the one or more patientspecific anatomical measurements,
identify one or more cut angles for performing a surgical procedure based on the application of the statistical model, and create a patient-specific cutting guide comprising one or more apertures positioned based on the one or more cut angles.
11. The system of claim 10, further comprising:
a manufacturing device configured to manufacture the patient-specific cutting guide design.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the manufacturing device comprises a 3D printer.
13. The system of any of claims 10-12, wherein the one or more patient-specific anatomical measurements comprise distal and anterior condyle radii measurements.
14. The system of any of claims 10-13, wherein the one or more processors are configured to identify the one or more cut angles by identifying one or more cut angles that provide balanced condylar gaps throughout a range of motion associated with one or more physical activities.
15. An article of manufacture for creating an activity-optimized cutting guide for a surgical procedure, the article of manufacture comprising a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing computer-executable instructions for performing a method comprising:
receiving one or more pre-operative images of one or more anatomical joints of a patient;
creating a three-dimensional anatomical model of the one or more anatomical joints based on the one or more pre-operative images;
determining one or more patient-specific anatomical measurements based on the three-dimensional anatomical model;
applying a statistical model of joint performance to the one or more patient-specific anatomical measurements;
identifying one or more cut angles for performing a surgical procedure based on the application of the statistical model; and
creating a patient-specific cutting guide comprising one or more apertures positioned based on the one or more cut angles.
