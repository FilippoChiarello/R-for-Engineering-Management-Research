METHODS AND APPARATUS TO CREATE DRONE DISPLAYS
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and apparatus to create drone displays are disclosed. An example drone display design system includes an audience configuration definer to receive an input representing a configuration of an audience from a user, and a drone display designer to, by executing an instruction with a processor, design a drone display to present content to the audience based on the input.

<claims>
1. 1-28. (canceled)
29. A drone display design genie, comprising: an audience configuration definer to receive an input representing a configuration of an audience from a user; and a drone display designer to, by executing an instruction with a processor, design a drone display to present content to the audience based on the input.
30. The drone display design genie of claim 29, wherein the drone display designer is to, by executing an instruction with a processor, design the drone display using parameter optimization.
31. The drone display design genie of claim 30, wherein using the parameter optimization includes at least one of a stochastic gradient descent, or the Euler-Lagrange differential equation.
32. The drone display design genie of claim 29, wherein the drone display designer is to, by executing an instruction with a processor, design the drone display by identifying a geometry that increases a number of audience members viewing the drone display at a perpendicular angle to the drone display.
33. The drone display design genie of claim 29, wherein the drone display designer is to: identify two drone display options; and receive a second input from the user selecting one of the two drone display options.
34. The drone display design genie of claim 29, wherein the drone display designer is to: receive a second input representing a change to the drone display; and modify the drone display according to the second input.
35. The drone display design genie of claim 29, wherein the drone display designer is to design the drone display for a first portion of the audience, and design a second drone display to present the content to a second portion of the audience based on the input.
36. The drone display design genie of claim 29, further including: a flight planner to allocate portions of the content to respective drones of the drone display; and a flight controller to fly the drones to form the drone display, and to present the content on the drone display.
37. A method, comprising: receiving an input representing a configuration of an audience from a user; and performing parameter optimization to design a drone display to present content to the audience based on the input.
38. The method of claim 37, wherein performing the parameter optimization includes at least one of a stochastic gradient descent, or the Euler-Lagrange differential equation.
39. The method of claim 37, wherein designing the drone display including identifying a geometry that increases a number of audience members viewing the drone display at a perpendicular angle to the drone display.
40. The method of claim 37, wherein designing the drone display includes: identify two drone display options; and receive a second input from the user selecting one of the two drone display options.
41. The method of claim 37, wherein designing the drone display includes designing the drone display for a first portion of the audience, and designing a second drone display for a second portion of the audience.
42. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium comprising instructions that, when executed, cause a machine to: receive an input representing a configuration of an audience from a user; design a drone display to present content to the audience based on the input; allocate portions of the content to respective drones of the drone display; and fly the drones to form the drone display, and to present the content on the drone display.
43. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 42, including instructions that, when executed, cause the machine to design the drone display using parameter optimization.
44. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 43, including instructions that, when executed, cause the machine to perform the parameter optimization using at least one of a stochastic gradient descent, or the Euler-Lagrange differential equation.
45. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 42, including instructions that, when executed, cause the machine to design the drone display by identifying a geometry that increases a number of audience members viewing the drone display at a perpendicular angle to the drone display.
46. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 42, including instructions that, when executed, cause the machine to: identify two drone display options; and receive a second input from the user selecting one of the two drone display options.
47. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium of claim 42, including instructions that, when executed, cause the machine to design the drone display for a first portion of the audience, and designing a second drone display for a second portion of the audience.
