DIAGNOSTIC APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
A diagnostic apparatus acquires data relating to a state of a machine, performs preprocessing on the acquired data, and modifies the preprocessed data by using a statistic relating to the state of the machine. Then, the diagnostic apparatus performs a process of machine learning by an auto encoder on the basis of the modified data and learns or diagnoses the state of the machine. Thus, this diagnostic apparatus provides a learning and inference method capable of uniformly handling a scale of data indicating a feature.

<claims>
1. A diagnostic apparatus that diagnoses a state of a machine, the diagnostic apparatus comprising: a data acquisition unit that acquires data related to the state of the machine; a pre-processing unit that preprocesses the data acquired by the data acquisition unit; and a modification unit that uses a statistic related to the state of the machine to modify the data preprocessed by the pre-processing unit, wherein a process of machine learning by an auto encoder is performed on the basis of the data modified by the modification unit, and the state of the machine is learned or diagnosed.
2. The diagnostic apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a statistic calculation unit that calculates a statistic related to the data preprocessed by the pre-processing unit; a learning unit that uses the data after modification by the modification unit to learn the state of the machine through the machine learning by the auto encoder and generate a learning model; and a learning model storage unit that stores the learning model and the statistic in association with each other, wherein the modification unit is configured to use the statistic calculated by the statistic calculation unit to modify the data preprocessed by the pre-processing unit.
3. The diagnostic apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a learning model storage unit that stores a learning model that has learned the state of the machine by the auto encoder and a statistic of data used for the learning in association with each other; and a diagnostic unit that diagnoses the state of the machine using the learning model stored in the learning model storage unit on the basis of the data after modification by the modification unit, wherein the modification unit uses the statistic stored in the learning model storage unit to modify the data preprocessed by the pre-processing unit.
4. The diagnostic apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the pre-processing unit performs a frequency analysis on time-series data in the data acquired by the data acquisition unit as preprocessing.
5. The diagnostic apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the diagnostic unit further includes a reverse modification unit that outputs, together with a diagnosis result, the data after modification used for the diagnosis, the reverse modification unit performing a reverse conversion of the modification performed by the modification unit on the data after modification that has been output by the diagnostic unit.
6. The diagnostic apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the modification by the modification unit is modification that expands, for each frequency component of the time-series data, a range of possible values that an amplitude value of the frequency component can take.
