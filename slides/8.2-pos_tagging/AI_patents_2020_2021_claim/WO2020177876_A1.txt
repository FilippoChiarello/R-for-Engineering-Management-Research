SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR TRAINING A MODEL PERFORMING HUMAN-LIKE DRIVING
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a method and system for training a human-like generative driving model for a vehicle, comprising: a - obtaining (SOI) a set of video data of driving scenes performed by a human driven vehicle, b - obtaining (S02) a data set of human driving maneuvers carried out during the driving scenes, c - training (S03) a generative driving model using the set of video data and the data set of human driving maneuvers, wherein the training step (S03) of c is augmented with an adversarial training scheme such that the prediction of the trained generative driving model becomes more human like.

<claims>
1. A method for training a human-like generative driving model for a vehicle, comprising the steps of:
a - obtaining (SOI) a set of video data of driving scenes performed by a human driven vehicle,
b - obtaining (S02) a data set of human driving maneuvers carried out during the driving scenes,
c - training (S03) a generative driving model using the set of video data and the data set of human driving maneuvers,
wherein the training step (S03) of c is augmented with an adversarial training scheme such that the prediction of the trained generative driving model becomes more human like.
2. The method according to the claim 1, wherein
the generative driving model outputs predicted driving maneuvers.
3. The method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein
the adversarial training scheme comprises:
cl - training (S03a) a discriminator model based on the predicted driving maneuvers outputted by the generative driving model and corresponding human driving maneuvers of the data set to discriminate between human and machine maneuvers, and
c2 - forcing (S03b) the generative driving model to learn more human like driving.
4. The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the step of obtaining (SOI) the set of video data further comprises:
al - obtaining (SOla) a route planning data set representing route information according to which the human driven vehicle have performed the driving scenes of the set of video data,
a2 - enriching (SOlb) the set of video data by the route planning data, such that the accuracy of the predicted driving maneuvers outputted by the generative driving model is increased.
5. The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the step of training (S03) the generative driving model comprises:
training the generative driving model based on a predefined loss function augmented by an adversary loss which is based on the output of the discriminator model.
6. The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the generative driving model receives as an input video data and data of human driving maneuvers of past time steps, and
outputs predicted driving maneuvers for future time steps.
7. The method according to the preceding claim, wherein
in case the set of video data are enriched by the route planning data before being inputted to the generative driving model, the generative driving model receives as a further input the vehicle location in past time steps.
8. The method according to the preceding claim, wherein
the generative driving model is a deep neural network, and/or
the discriminator model is a deep neural network.
9. A system for training a human-like generative driving model for a vehicle, comprising:
a module A for obtaining a set of video data of driving scenes performed by a human driven vehicle,
a module B for obtaining a data set of human driving maneuvers carried out during the driving scenes,
a module C for training a generative driving model using the set of video data, and the data set of human driving maneuvers,
wherein training in module C is augmented with an adversarial training scheme such that the prediction of the trained generative driving model becomes more human like.
10. A system for predicting human-like driving maneuvers of a vehicle, comprising the model of step c of any one of claims 1 to 8 or of module C of claim 9.
11. A computer program including instructions for executing the steps of a method according to any one of claims 1 to 8 when said program is executed by a computer.
12. A recording medium readable by a computer and having recorded thereon a computer program including instructions for executing the steps of a method according to any one of claims 1 to 8.
