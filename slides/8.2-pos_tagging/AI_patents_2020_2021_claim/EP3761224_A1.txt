<title>
METHOD OF AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTING INFORMATION OF A PREDEFINED TYPE FROM A DOCUMENT
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system of automatically extracting information of a predefined type from a document is provided. The method comprises using an object detection algorithm to identify at least one segment of the document that is likely to comprise the information of the predefined type. The method further comprises building at least one bounding box corresponding to said at least one segment and if the bounding box is likely to comprise the information of the predefined type extracting the information comprised by the bounding box from the at least one bounding box.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of automatically extracting information of a predefined type from a document, the method comprising
using an object detection algorithm to identify at least one segment of the document that is likely to comprise the information of the predefined type, building at least one bounding box corresponding to said at least one segment,
in response to identifying that a bounding box likely comprises the information of the predefined type, extracting the information comprised by the bounding box from the at least one bounding box.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein a character identification algorithm is used for extracting the information of the predefined type from the at least one bounding box.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the character identification algorithm used for extracting the information of the predefined type is configured to utilize characteristics of said information of the predefined type in order to recognize the information of the predefined type.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the utilized characteristics of said information of a predefined type comprise at least one of a comma or decimal point and a number format..
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the neural network is a multilayer neural network, whereby each different layer is to identify different characteristics of the document.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein a first layer of the neural network is directed to differentiate between empty and non-empty regions of a document and is further used to identify basic patterns present on the document and a second layer of the neural network is to identify shapes that are more complex compared to said basic patterns present on the document.
7. The method of any one claims 5 or 6, wherein the neural network is a neural network that is compatible with a decision layer, the decision layer being a neural network layer serving to detect at least one of (i) a location of the bounding box, (ii) height and width of a bounding box, and (iii) a classification score indicating a classification of a detected character.
8. The method of any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein a convolutional neural network, in particular a fully-convolutional neural network, is used by the object detection algorithm and/or the character identification algorithm.
9. The method of any one of claims 5 to 8, wherein the method comprises a training activity for training the neural network with a plurality of documents to correctly extract the information of the predefined type.
10. The method of any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein a probability value is assigned to a bounding box, the probability value being indicative of the probability that a certain bounding box contains the information of the predefined type.
11. The method of any one of claims 2 to 10, wherein a probability value is assigned to a character identified by a character identification algorithm, the probability value being indicative of the probability that the identified character is identical with a character actually comprised by the information of the predefined type.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein a probability value assigned to a bounding box and probability values assigned to characters within that bounding box are used to provide a combined confidence score.
13. The method of any one of claims 1 to 12, wherein the documents are digital scanned documents obtained from a scan of a paper-based document, in particular receipts or invoices, and wherein the information of a predefined type is at least one of a creation date, a total amount, an arrival/departure date, a VAT-ID, a receipt id and an invoice number or any other travel related or accountant related data of a predefined type.
14. A computer system, the computer system comprising at least one computer being arranged to execute the method of any one of claims 1 to 13.
15. A computer program product comprising program code instructions stored on a computer readable medium to execute the method steps according to any one of claims 1 to 13, when said program is executed on a computer.
