<title>
Automatic generation of variations of search criteria for use in a predictive search engine
</title>

<abstract>
A device can obtain location information that includes a set of location name values associated with a set of locations. The device can identify, using a natural language processing model, a set of proper noun values associated with the set of location name values. The device can generate a set of search criteria variant terms for the set of proper noun values. The set of search criteria variant terms can each include one or more characters associated with an alias of a particular proper noun value. The device can receive, from a user device, partial search criteria relating to an alias of a destination location. The device can process the partial search criteria using the set of search criteria variant terms to identify a set of candidate search terms. The device can provide the set of candidate search terms to the user device.

<claims>
1. A device, comprising: one or more memories; and one or more processors, communicatively coupled to the one or more memories, to: obtain location information associated with a set of locations, the location information including a set of location name values for the set of locations; identify, using a natural language processing model, a set of proper noun values associated with the set of location name values; generate a set of search criteria variant terms for the set of proper noun values, the set of search criteria variant terms each including one or more characters associated with an alias of a particular proper noun value of the set of proper noun values, and where the one or more processors, when generating the set of search criteria variant terms, are to: generate, for one or more proper noun values of the set of proper noun values, a configurable template used to generate one or more search criteria variant terms of the set of search criteria variant terms, the configurable template to identify a geographic area associated with the one or more proper noun values, and generate the one or more search criteria variant terms using the configurable template; receive, from a user device, partial search criteria relating to an alias of a destination location; process the partial search criteria using the set of search criteria variant terms to identify a set of candidate search terms; and provide the set of candidate search terms for display on an interface of the user device.
2. The device of claim 1, where the one or more processors, when generating the set of search criteria variant terms, are to: determine a particular alias for a proper noun value of the set of proper noun values, and generate one or more search criteria variant terms, of the set of search criteria variant terms, for the particular alias for the proper noun value, the one or more search criteria variant terms including at least one of: one or more variations of a first name, one or more variations of a last name, one or more variations of a middle name or initial, or one or more variations of a nickname that is different than the first name, the last name, and/or the middle name or initial.
3. The device of claim 1, where the one or more processors, when generating the set of search criteria variant terms, are to: generate, for one or more proper noun values, of the set of proper noun values, another configurable template that is to be used to generate one or more search criteria variant terms, of the set of search criteria variant terms, the other configurable template to identify a group of proper noun values that share a common type of alias, and generate the one or more search criteria variant terms using the other configurable template.
4. The device of claim 1, where the one or more processors, when generating the set of search criteria variant terms, are to: generate, for one or more proper noun values, of the set of proper noun values, another configurable template that includes a language-specific naming convention that is to be used to generate one or more search criteria variant terms, of the set of search criteria variant terms, and generate the one or more search criteria variant terms using the other configurable template.
5.

7. The device of claim 1, where the one or more processors, when processing the partial search criteria, are to: use the partial search criteria to query a data structure that stores the set of search criteria variant terms, and receive the set of candidate search terms as a result of the query.
8. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions, the instructions comprising: one or more instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to: obtain location information associated with a set of locations, the location information including a set of location name values for the set of locations; identify, using a natural language processing model, a set of proper noun values associated with the set of location name values; generate a set of search criteria variant terms for the set of proper noun values, the set of search criteria variant terms each including one or more characters associated with an alias of a particular proper noun value of the set of proper noun values, and where the one or more instructions, that cause the one or more processors to generate the set of search criteria variant terms, cause the one or more processors to: generate, for one or more proper noun values of the set of proper noun values, a configurable template used to generate one or more search criteria variant terms of the set of search criteria variant terms, the configurable template to identify a geographic area associated with the one or more proper noun values, and generate the one or more search criteria variant terms using the configurable template; receive, from a user device, partial search criteria relating to an alias of a destination location; process the partial search criteria using the set of search criteria variant terms to identify a set of candidate search terms; and provide the set of candidate search terms for display on an interface of the user device.
9. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, where the one or more instructions, that cause the one or more processors generate the set of search criteria variant terms, cause the one or more processors to: determine a particular alias for a proper noun value, of the set of proper noun values, by analyzing historical search information, the historical search information including a threshold number of searches that searched for the particular alias, and generate one or more search criteria variant terms, of the set of search criteria variant terms, for the particular alias for the proper noun value.
10. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, where the one or more instructions, that cause the one or more processors to generate the set of search criteria variant terms, cause the one or more processors to: generate, for one or more proper noun values, of the set of proper noun values, another configurable template that is to be used to generate one or more search criteria variant terms, of the set of search criteria variant terms, where the one or more processors generate the other configurable template by analyzing historical search information to identify a group of proper noun values that share a common type of alias, and generate the one or more search criteria variant terms using the other configurable template.
11. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, where the one or more instructions, that cause the one or more processors to identify the set of proper noun values, cause the one or more processors to: train the natural language processing model on historical location information, and provide the location information as input to the natural language processing model to cause the natural language processing model identify the set of proper noun values, where the natural language processing model uses a named-entity recognition (NER) technique to process the location information.
12. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 8, where the one or more instructions, when executed by the one or more processors, further cause the one or more processors to: receiving feedback information associated with a set of requests for navigational directions, the feedback information indicating which candidate search terms were selected during each request, of the set of requests for navigational directions, and modify one or more search criteria variant terms based on the feedback information.
