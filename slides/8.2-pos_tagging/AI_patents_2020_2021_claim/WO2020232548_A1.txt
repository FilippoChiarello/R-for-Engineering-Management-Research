PAN-CANCER TRANSCRIPTIONAL SIGNATURE
</title>

<abstract>
There is described herein a pan-cancer transcriptional signature. In one aspect, there is described a method of diagnosing cancerous cells in a patient, the method comprising: a) providing a sample containing genetic material from patient cells suspected of being cancerous; b) determining or measuring expression levels in the patient cells of at least 3 of the 1919 genes listed in Table B; c) computing a score using a classifier that takes said expression level values as input, the classifier having been previously trained on known cancerous and non-cancerous samples; wherein the score provides a likelihood of a cancerous cell.

<claims>
1. A method of diagnosing cancerous cells in a patient, the method comprising: a) providing a sample containing genetic material from patient cells suspected of being cancerous; b) determining or measuring expression levels in the patient cells of at least 3 of the 1919 genes listed in Table B; c) computing a score using a classifier that takes said expression level values as input, the classifier having been previously trained on known cancerous and noncancerous samples; wherein the score provides a likelihood of a cancerous cell.
2. The method of claim 1 , wherein the at least 3 genes are genes found in at least one of Tables E, F, and I.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the at least 3 genes are genes found in at least two of Tables E, F, and I.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the at least 3 genes are genes found in all of Tables E, F, and I.
5. The method of any one of claims 1-4, wherein the at least 3 genes is at least 10 genes.
6. The method of any one of claims 1-3, wherein the at least 3 genes is at least 30 genes.
7. The method of any one of claims 1-2, wherein the at least 3 genes is at least 100 genes.
8. The method of claim 2, wherein the at least 3 genes is at least 20, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 150, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 or 1800 genes.
9. The method of claim 1 , wherein the at least 3 genes are the 10 genes in T able I .
10. The method of claim 1 , wherein the at least 3 genes consists of the 10 genes in Table
11. The method of claim 1 , wherein the at least 3 genes are the 30 genes in Table E.
12. The method of claim 1 , wherein the at least 3 genes consists of 30 the genes in Table
E.
13. The method of claim 1 , wherein the at least 3 genes are the 100 genes in T able F.
14. The method of claim 1 , wherein the at least 3 genes consists of the 100 genes in Table
F.
15. The method of any one of claims 1-14, further comprising determining the tissue of origin of the patient cell by: d) determining or measuring expression levels in the patient cells of at least 3 genes of the 450 genes listed in Table H; e) computing a score using a classifier that takes said expression level values as input, the classifier having been previously trained on known cancerous and noncancerous samples from known tissues of origin; wherein the score provides a likelihood of the patient cell's tissue of origin.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the at least 3 genes are the genes with the highest Varlmp

18. The method of any one of claims 1-17, wherein the cancer is selected from the cancers identified in Table A.
19. The method of any one of claims 1-18, wherein if there is a low likelihood of cancer, further comprising managing the patient with active surveillance.
20. The method of any one of claims 1-19, wherein if there is a high likelihood of cancer, further comprising treating the patient with surgery, endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, gene therapy, thermal therapy, or ultrasound therapy.
21. A computer-implemented method of diagnosing cancerous cells in a patient, the method comprising: a) receiving, at at least one processor, data reflecting expression levels of at least 3 genes of the 1919 genes listed in Table B in the patient cells; b) constructing, at at least one processor, a patient profile based on the expression levels; c) computing, at the at least one processor, a prediction score using a classifier that takes said expression level values as input, the classifier having been previously trained on known cancerous and non-cancerous samples; wherein the score provides a likelihood of a cancerous cell.
22. A computer program product for use in conjunction with a general-purpose computer having a processor and a memory connected to the processor, the computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having a computer mechanism encoded thereon, wherein the computer program mechanism may be loaded into the memory of the computer and cause the computer to carry out the method of claim 21.
23. A computer readable medium having stored thereon a data structure for storing the computer program product according to claim 22.
24. A device for diagnosing cancerous cells in a patient, the device comprising: at least one processor; and electronic memory in communication with the at least one processor, the electronic memory storing processor-executable code that, when executed at the at least one processor, causes the at least one processor to: a) receive data reflecting expression levels of at least 3 genes of the 1919 genes listed in Table B from the patient cells; and b) compute, at the at least one processor, a prediction score using a classifier that takes said expression level values as input, the classifier having been previously trained on known cancerous and non-cancerous samples; wherein the score provides a likelihood of a cancerous cell.
25. A method of diagnosing cancerous cells in an animal, the method comprising: a) providing a sample containing genetic material from the animal's cells suspected of being cancerous; b) determining or measuring expression levels of at least 3 genes of the 150 genes listed in Table I in the animal cells; c) computing a score using a classifier that takes said expression level values as input, the classifier having been previously trained on known cancerous and noncancerous samples; wherein the score provides a likelihood of a cancerous cell.
