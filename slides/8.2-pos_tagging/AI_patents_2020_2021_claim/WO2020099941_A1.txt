APPLICATION OF DEEP LEARNING FOR MEDICAL IMAGING EVALUATION
</title>

<abstract>
This disclosure generally pertains to methods and systems for processing electronic data obtained from imaging or other diagnostic and evaluative medical procedures. Certain embodiments relate to methods for the development of deep learning algorithms that perform machine recognition of specific features and conditions in imaging and other medical data. Another embodiment provides systems configured to detect and localize medical abnormalities on medical imaging scans by a deep learning algorithm.

CLAIM
We claim:
1. A method for developing a deep learning system to detect and localize medical
abnormalities on chest X-ray scans, comprising:
Selecting medical imaging scans and extracting medical abnormalities using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms;
Pre-processing the selected medical imaging scans by resizing and tag-specific data augmentations;
Training a deep learning algorithm with the selected medical imaging scans;
Predicting the presence/absence of a particular type of medical abnormalities by combining the predictions of multiple models; and
Generating a score that corresponds to a level of recognition of the medical abnormalities and outputting a bounding box representing the precise location and extent of the medical abnormalities.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the deep learning algorithm comprises a convolutional neural network architecture.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the architecture is modified by pre-training on a task of separating chest X-rays from x-rays of other body parts.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the models are selected using various heuristics.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the medical abnormalities comprise blunted CP angle, calcification, cardiomegaly, cavity, consolidation, fibrosis, hilar enlargement, opacity and pleural effusion.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the accuracy of the deep learning algorithm for detecting the medical abnormalities is validated by comparing with the radiologist reports.
7. A system configured to detect and localize medical abnormalities on chest X-ray scans using a deep learning algorithm, wherein the deep learning algorithm is developed by the steps of: Selecting medical imaging scans and extracting medical abnormalities using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms;
Pre-processing the selected medical imaging scans by resizing and tag-specific data augmentations;
Training a deep learning algorithm with the selected medical imaging scans;
Predicting the presence/absence of a particular type of medical abnormalities by combining the predictions of multiple models; and
Generating a score that corresponds to a level of recognition of the medical abnormalities and outputting a bounding box representing the precise location and extent of the medical abnormalities.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the deep learning algorithm comprises a convolutional neural network architecture.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the architecture is modified by pre-training on a task of separating chest X-rays from x-rays of other body parts.
10. The system of claim 7, wherein the models are selected using various heuristics.
11. The system of claim 7, wherein the medical abnormalities comprise blunted CP angle, calcification, cardiomegaly, cavity, consolidation, fibrosis, hilar enlargement, opacity and pleural effusion.
12. The system of claim 7, wherein the accuracy of the deep learning algorithm for detecting the medical abnormalities is validated by comparing with the radiologist reports
13. The system of claim 7, wherein the algorithms achieve AUC of 0.93 ± 0.01 for detection of abnormal scans, and AUCs of 0.94 ± 0.02, 0.88 ± 0.03, 0.97 ± 0.02, 0.93 ± 0.07, 0.93 ± 0.04, 0.88 ± 0.05, 0.89 ± 0.05, 0.93 ± 0.02, 0.98 ± 0.02 for the detection of blunted costophrenic angle, calcification, cardiomegaly, cavity, consolidation, fibrosis, hilar enlargement, opacity and pleural effusion, respectively.
