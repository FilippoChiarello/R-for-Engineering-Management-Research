Performing an action based on user interaction data
</title>

<abstract>
A device obtains historical interaction data concerning a plurality of user interactions, where a user interaction of the plurality of user interactions includes one or more touchpoint sets, obtains historical response data concerning a plurality of user responses, where a user response of the plurality of user responses corresponds to a user interaction, and processes the historical interaction data and the historical response data using a modelling pipeline to determine an association between user interaction score and a touchpoint set. The device determines information concerning a current user interaction, processes the information concerning the current user interaction using the modelling pipeline to determine a current user interaction score and ranking of one or more touchpoint sets of the current user interaction, and causes, based on the current user interaction score and the ranking of the one or more touchpoint sets, at least one action to be performed.
