<title>
Headphones that provide binaural sound to a portable electronic device
</title>

<abstract>
Headphones provide binaural sound to a location behind a portable electronic device. The sound is convolved or processed to a location that is behind the portable electronic device so that the listener perceives the location of the sound as originating from the location of the portable electronic device.

<claims>
1. A method that improves a user experience of a user wearing headphones and watching images on a display of a portable electronic device (PED), the method comprising: tracking, with head tracking in the headphones worn by the user, head movements of the user with respect to the PED in a hand of the user watching the images on the display of the PED that is less than one meter away from a face of the user; and improving the user experience of the user watching the images on the display of the PED by processing sound of the images into binaural sound with a digital signal processor (DSP) and with head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) having a coordinate location behind the PED held in the hand of the user while the display of the PED is less than one meter away from the face of the user, wherein the coordinate location of the HRTFs does not occur at a location of the PED but a location behind the PED along a line-of-sight from a head of the user to the location behind the PED.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the DSP processes the sound with far-field HRTFs while the PED is located at a near-field distance from the face of the user, and the PED is one of a smartphone and a tablet computer.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the location behind the PED is located along the line-of-sight in which a distance (d1) from the face of the user to the PED is 0.1 meters <d1≤0.5 meters and a distance (d2) from the face of the user to the location behind the PED is 1.0 meters≤d2≤1.5 meters.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the location behind the PED occurs along the line-of-sight in which a distance (d1) from the face of the user to the PED is d1<1.0 meter and a distance (d2) from the face of the user to the location behind the PED is d2>1.0 meter.
5. The method of claim 1 further comprising: switching the binaural sound to stereo sound in response to detecting a change to a head orientation of the user that exceeds a threshold value in an azimuth direction.
6. The method of claim 1 further comprising: switching the binaural sound to stereo sound in response to detecting rotation of the PED.
7. The method of claim 1 further comprising: switching the binaural sound to stereo sound in response to determining the face of the user is no longer captured with a camera of the PED.
8. A method that improves a user experience of a user wearing headphones and listening to sound from a portable electronic device (PED), the method comprising: tracking, with head tracking in the headphones worn by the user, head movements of the user with respect to the PED that is less than one meter away from a head of the user; and improving the user experience of the user listening to the sound from the PED by processing the sound into binaural sound with a digital signal processor (DSP) and with far-field head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) having a coordinate location behind the PED that is less than one meter away from the head of the user, wherein the DSP in the headphones processes the sound with the far-field HRTFs even though the PED is located within a near-field distance from the head of the user.
9. The method of claim 8 further comprising: detecting, with the head tracking in the headphones, a rotation of ninety degrees (90°) of the head of the user with respect a location of the PED; and changing, in response to detecting the rotation, the binaural sound into stereo sound.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the coordinate location of the far-field HRTFs processing the sound is located behind the PED along a line-of-sight that extends from the head of the user thru the PED.
11. The method of claim 8 further comprising: changing the sound from localizing as the binaural sound to localizing as stereo sound when the head movements exceed a threshold value in an azimuth direction.
12. The method of claim 8 further comprising: detecting when the head of the user moves so the user is no longer looking at the PED; and switching, in response to detecting that the user is no longer looking at the PED, the sound from being in the binaural sound to being in stereo sound.
13. The method of claim 8 further comprising: switching the sound from being in the binaural sound to being in stereo sound in response to detecting rotation of the PED.
14. The method of claim 8 further comprising: switching the sound from being in the binaural sound to being in stereo sound in response to detecting a hand gesture from the user.
15. Headphones, comprising: head tracking that tracks head movements of a user wearing the headphone with respect to a portable electronic device (PED) that provides sound to the user; and a digital signal processor (DSP) that processes the sound from the PED with far-field head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) having a coordinate location behind the PED while the PED is located at a near-field distance from a head of the user, wherein the coordinate location of the far-field HRTFs does not occur at a location of the PED but a location behind the PED along a line-of-sight from the head of the user to the location behind the PED.
16. The headphones of claim 15, wherein the head tracking includes an accelerometer that detects a rotation of the head of the user, and the sound changes from being in the binaural sound to being in stereo sound when the rotation exceeds a predetermined amount in an azimuth direction.
17. The headphones of claim 15, wherein the sound automatically switches from the binaural sound to stereo sound when a distance from the head of the user to the PED is greater than a threshold amount.
18. The headphones of claim 15, wherein the sound changes from the binaural sound to stereo sound when the head of the user is no longer directed to the PED.
19. The headphones of claim 15, wherein the sound changes from the binaural sound to stereo sound in response to the PED rotating while in a hand of the user.
20. The headphones of claim 15, wherein the coordinate location of the far-field HRTFs occurs behind the PED a distance (d) from the PED such that d≥0.5 meters.
