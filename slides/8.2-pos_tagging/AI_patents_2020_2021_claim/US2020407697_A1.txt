COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR MOLECULAR MEMORY STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL
</title>

<abstract>
Compositions and methods for the storage, organization, access, and retrieval of information encoded by sequence controlled polymers such as data storage nucleic acids are provided. In some embodiments, organization, storage, and/or selective retrieval of the data is facilitated by hybridization of barcode sequence of the sequence controlled polymer to the reverse complementary sequence of an oligonucleotide. The plurality of oligonucleotides can be arrayed using a known organization scheme, and selectively capture and localize the corresponding sequence controlled polymer. In some embodiments, the compositions and methods utilize recombinant bacteriophage, typically featuring a minigenome having a bacteriophage origin of replication and packaging signal separated from a data storage sequence by barcodes.

The nucleic acid of claim 10, wherein the bacteriophage origin of replication is f1, the selectable marker is an antibiotic resistant gene, the nucleic acid sequence encoding data is between about 50 and 50,000 nucleotides in length, and wherein the nucleic acid optionally further comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding M13 capsid protein(s) or fusion protein(s) thereof.
12. The nucleic acid of claim 6, wherein the insert encodes an expression construct.
13. The nucleic acid of claim 12, wherein the expression construct encodes an antigen binding protein, optionally wherein the antigen binding protein is an antibody or fragment or fusion protein thereof.
