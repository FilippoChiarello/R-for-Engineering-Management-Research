MEMRISTIVE NANOFIBER NEURAL NETWORKS
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are various embodiments of memristive devices comprising a number of nodes. Memristive fibers are used to form conductive and memristive paths in the devices. Each memristive fiber may couple one or more nodes to one or more other nodes. In one case, a memristive device includes a first node, a second node, and a memristive fiber. The memristive fiber includes a conductive core and a memristive shell surrounding at least a portion of the conductive core along at least a portion of the memristive fiber. The memristive fiber couples the first node to the second node through a portion of the memristive shell and at least a portion of the conductive core
