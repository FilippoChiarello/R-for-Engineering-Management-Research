<title>
TEMPORAL EXPLANATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING MODEL OUTCOMES
</title>

<abstract>
In transactional systems where past transactions can have impact on the current score of a machine learning based decision model, the transactions that are most responsible for the score and the associated reasons are determined by the transactional system. A system and method identifies such past transactions that maximally impact the current score and allow for a more effective understanding of the scores generated by a model in a transactional system and explanation of specific transactions for automated decisioning, to explain the scores in terms of past transactions. Further an existing instance-based explanation system is used to identify the reasons for the score, and how the identified transactions influence these reasons. A combination of impact on score and impact on reasons determines the most impactful past transaction with respect to the most recent score being explained.

<claims>
1. A method, executed by a transactional analytics system, the method comprising: receiving transactional data of an entity over a period of time, the transactional data representing a plurality of transactions of the entity; deriving an input vector from the plurality of transactions; generating, by a scoring model of the transactional analytics system, a score based on the input vector derived from the plurality of transactions, the scoring module model generating the score based on the transactional data as an input; generating, by an explanation model of the transactional analytics system, a weighted reason vector and associated top ranked reasons based on the input vector derived from the plurality of transactions, the weighted reason vector and top ranked reasons providing a set of top contributor variables in the input vector and latent features of the scoring model that explain the score; using the scoring model, recursively omitting selected transactions of the plurality of transactions from the input to determine a maximal effect of at least one of the plurality of transactions on the score, the weighted reason vector, and/or the associated top ranked reasons; generating, based on the omission of at least one of the plurality of transactions having the maximal effect on the score, the weighted reason vector, and/or associated top ranked reason, an importance measure that is a function of a change in the score and a change in the weighted reason vector and/or the top ranked reasons; using an importance measure and based on the at least one of the plurality of transactions, determining the at least one of the plurality of transactions that has the maximal importance measure; and outputting the at least one of a plurality of transactions in an output file to a computer to enable review of the temporal events and transactions most responsible for the entity's current score and reason vector and/or top ranked reasons.
2. The method in accordance with claim 1, wherein the at least one of the plurality of transactions contributes to one or more past temporal transactions most responsible for the score and the associated reason vector and top ranked reason reported by the scoring model.
3. The method in accordance with claim 1, wherein recursively omitting selected transactions further includes generating, by the scoring model of the transactional analytics system, a revised score, and by the explanation model of the transactional analytics system, a reason vector, and ranked reasons based on the maximal effect of the omission at least one of the plurality of transactions.
4. The method in accordance with claim 1, further comprising generating, based on the omission of at least one of the plurality of transactions to quantify the effect on the score, reason vector, and/or associated top ranked reason, an importance measure of the omitted transaction(s) that is a function of the change in the score and the change in the energy associated with the weighted reason vector and/or the top ranked reasons, and the change in the rank associated with the weighted reason vector and/or the top ranked reasons.
5. The method in accordance with claim 4, further comprising utilizing the importance measure for identifying and generating a set of temporal events of past transaction(s) which have the maximal importance measure.
6. The method in accordance with claim 5, further comprising translating, by a translation module of the transactional analytics system, the at least one set of temporal explanations and/or reason codes into a human-readable explanation of a reason for the score; further associating the outcome of these reason codes to the at least transaction event that had a maximal contribution to the entity's current score and reason vector/ranked reason state.
7. The method in accordance with claim 6, further comprising providing the output file to a human analyst or automated communication system to review the at least one of the plurality of transactions that has the maximal effect on the score, reason vector, and/or ranked reason codes.
8. A transactional analytics system comprising: a programmable processor; and a non-transitory machine-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the at least one programmable processor to perform operations comprising: receive transactional data of an entity over a period of time, the transactional data representing a plurality of transactions of the entity; derive an input vector from the plurality of transactions; generate, by a scoring model, a score based on the input vector derived from the plurality of transactions, the scoring module model generating the score based on the transactional data as an input; generate, by an explanation model, a weighted reason vector and associated top ranked reasons based on the input vector derived from the plurality of transactions, the weighted reason vector and top ranked reasons providing a set of top contributor variables in the input vector and latent features of the scoring model that explain the score; recursively omit selected transactions of the plurality of transactions from the input to determine a maximal effect of at least one of the plurality of transactions on the score, the weighted reason vector, and/or the associated top ranked reasons; generate, based on the omission of at least one of the plurality of transactions having the maximal effect on the score, the weighted reason vector, and/or associated top ranked reason, an importance measure that is a function of a change in the score and a change in the weighted reason vector and/or the top ranked reasons; determine, using an importance measure and based on the at least one of the plurality of transactions, the at least one of the plurality of transactions that has the maximal importance measure; and output the at least one of a plurality of transactions in an output file to a computer to enable review of the temporal events and transactions most responsible for the entity's current score and reason vector and/or top ranked reasons.
9. The system in accordance with claim 8, wherein the at least one of the plurality of transactions contributes to one or more past temporal transactions most responsible for the score and the associated reason vector and top ranked reason reported by the scoring model.
10. The system in accordance with claim 8, wherein recursively omitting selected transactions further includes generating, by the scoring model of the transactional analytics system, a revised score, and by the explanation model of the transactional analytics system, a reason vector, and ranked reasons based on the maximal effect of the omission at least one of the plurality of transactions.
11. The system in accordance with claim 7, wherein the instructions further cause the at least one programmable processor to perform operations to generate, based on the omission of at least one of the plurality of transactions to quantify the effect on the score, reason vector, and/or associated top ranked reason, an importance measure of the omitted transaction(s) that is a function of the change in the score and the change in the energy associated with the weighted reason vector and/or the top ranked reasons, and the change in the rank associated with the weighted reason vector and/or the top ranked reasons.
