<title>
Vehicle load prediction
</title>

<abstract>
An object outside of a vehicle can be detected with vehicle sensor data. A load for the vehicle can be predicted at least in part based on classifying the object. A vehicle component can be actuated based on the predicted load.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method, executed in a computer comprising a processor and a memory such that the method comprises: receiving data from one or more sensors in a vehicle; detecting an object outside of a vehicle with the data received from the one or more sensors; predicting a load for the vehicle at least in part based on classifying the object; and actuating a vehicle component to at least one of control a vehicle opening, control vehicle motion, or restrict vehicle motion, based on whether the predicted load exceeds a capacity of the vehicle to accept the object according to the load predicted at least in part based on classifying the object detected outside of the vehicle.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising, based on classifying the object, determining whether the vehicle can accept the predicted load.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising specifying a location within a vehicle sensor field of view at which the object is to be detected.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising, upon determining that the vehicle cannot accept the predicted load, transmitting a message to a user.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising predicting the load according to at least one of a weight and a volume of the object.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising predicting the load based on user data in addition to classifying the object.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the user data includes one or more of a location, a destination, a load history, and a number of user-specified cargo objects.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising predicting the load in part based on an estimated size of the object.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising predicting the load in part based on data from a cargo source.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the data received from the one or more sensors includes at least one of an image, LIDAR data, weight sensor data, and vehicle suspension data.
11. A computer comprising a processor and a memory, the memory storing instructions executable by the processor to: receive data from one or more sensors in a vehicle; detect an object outside of a vehicle with the data received from the one or more sensors; predict a load for the vehicle at least in part based on classifying the object; and actuate a vehicle component to at least one of control a vehicle opening, control vehicle motion, or restrict vehicle motion, based on whether the predicted load exceeds a capacity of the vehicle to accept the object according to the load predicted at least in part based on classifying the object detected outside of the vehicle.
12. The computer of claim 11, the memory further storing instructions to, based on classifying the object, determine whether the vehicle can accept the predicted load.
13. The computer of claim 11, the memory further storing instructions to specify a location within a vehicle sensor field of view at which the object is to be detected.
14. The computer of claim 11, the memory further storing instructions to, upon determining that the vehicle cannot accept the predicted load, transmit a message to a user.
15. The computer of claim 11, the memory further storing instructions to predict the load according to at least one of a weight and a volume of the object.
16. The computer of claim 11, the memory further storing instructions to predict the load based on user data in addition to classifying the object.
17. The computer of claim 16, wherein the user data includes one or more of a location, a destination, a load history, and a number of user-specified cargo objects.
18. The computer of claim 11, the memory further storing instructions to predict the load in part based on an estimated size of the object.
19. The computer of claim 11, the memory further storing instructions to predict the load in part based on data from a cargo source.
20. The computer of claim 11, wherein the data received from the one or more sensors includes at least one of an image, LIDAR data, weight sensor data, and vehicle suspension data.
