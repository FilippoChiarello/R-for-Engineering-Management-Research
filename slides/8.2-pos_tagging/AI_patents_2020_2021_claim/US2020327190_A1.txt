PERSONALIZED BOOK-TO-MOVIE ADAPTATION RECOMMENDATION
</title>

<abstract>
A method, computer system, and a computer program product for automatically recommending a plurality of text snippets from a book script for a movie adaptation is provided. The present invention may include receiving, by a user, a piece of input data, wherein the input data includes the book script, and a plurality of past book-to-movie adaptations. The present invention may then include identifying a plurality of text snippets associated with the received book script. The present invention may also include recommending the plurality of text snippets associated with the received book script to include in a movie based on the plurality of past book-to-movie adaptations and a plurality of movie reviews corresponding with the plurality of past book-to-movie adaptations.
