SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR AUTOMATED ANALYSIS OF BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE
</title>

<abstract>
An embodiment of the present invention is directed to a user friendly dynamic tool for business intelligence automated analytics that enable end users, e.g., employees, etc. to maximize efficiency and flexibility while interacting with data systems across applications. An embodiment of the present invention provides real-time analytics based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and an interactive Chatbot interface. The innovative framework may be applicable across various lines of business and scenarios.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system for automated analysis of business intelligence comprising: a query interface configured to receive a natural language user input; a natural language understanding processor comprising a parser and interpreter to determine a user intent and generate an intermediate query and further based on a context manager; a query processor configured to translate the intermediate query to a database query and execute the database query against a database; and a presentation interface configured to generate a result output that comprises results of the database query in natural language.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the query interface is provided on an electronic device.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the query is received in a dialog with a plurality of interactions with a chatbot.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the interpreter is in communication with the context manager and a concept mapper that receives inputs from a domain concept ontology and an acronym dictionary.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the natural language understanding processor applies one or more entitlements to generate the intermediate query.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the database query is a SQL query.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the query processor further parses one or more graph nodes and relationships to generate the database query.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the interpreter identifies a plurality of intents that are ranked.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein one or more user actions associated with the result output are tracked.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more user actions comprises scrolling speed.
11. A method for automated analysis of business intelligence, the method comprising the steps of: receiving, via a query interface, a natural language user input; determining, via a natural language understanding processor comprising a parser and interpreter, a user intent; generating an intermediate query and further based on a context data from a context manager; translating, via a query processor, the intermediate query to a database query and executing the database query against a database; and generating, via a presentation interface, a result output that comprises results of the database query in natural language.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the query interface is provided on an electronic device.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the query is received in a dialog with a plurality of interactions with a chatbot.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein the interpreter is in communication with the context manager and a concept mapper that receives inputs from a domain concept ontology and an acronym dictionary.
15. The method of claim 11, wherein the natural language understanding processor applies one or more entitlements to generate the intermediate query.
16. The method of claim 11, wherein the database query is a SQL query.
17. The method of claim 11, wherein the query processor further parses one or more graph nodes and relationships to generate the database query.
18. The method of claim 11, wherein the interpreter identifies a plurality of intents that are ranked.
19. The method of claim 11, wherein one or more user actions associated with the result output are tracked.
20. The method of claim 11, wherein the one or more user actions comprises scrolling speed.
