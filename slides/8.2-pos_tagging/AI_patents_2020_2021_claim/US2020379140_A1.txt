<title>
Methods and Devices for Activity Monitoring in Spaces Utilizing an Array of Motion Sensors
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the present disclosure include arrays of motion sensors that may be used to monitor a space to determine occupancy characteristics of the space, such as whether or not the space is occupied and the number of people located within the space. The array of motion sensors may be operatively connected to one or more building system components, such as lighting and HVAC equipment and can be used for adjusting an operating condition of the building system component based on whether a space is occupied.

<claims>
1. A method of determining an occupancy characteristic of a space with an array of motion sensors operatively connected to a processor, the method comprising: receiving sensor data from the array of motion sensors; characterizing, by the processor, the sensor data as components of state vectors; and determining, by the processor, occupancy characteristics of the space by analyzing the state vectors.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising applying, by the processor, a compaction process to disregard ones of the state vectors associated with random motion within the space.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the compaction process includes disregarding, by the processor, state vectors in which all of the motion sensors are inactive for a time duration that is less than a threshold value.
4. The method of claim 3, further comprising defining, by the processor, the threshold value as a duration of time for a person to walk across a field of view (FOV) of one of the motion sensors.
5. The method of claim 3, further comprising determining, by the processor, the threshold value by identifying three consecutive state vectors, the first and third of the three consecutive state vectors each containing only one active motion sensor and second state vector containing no active motion sensors, wherein the active motion sensors in the first and third state vectors are immediately adjacent in space.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the space includes a gate for entering and exiting the space, and wherein one of the motion sensors is a gate sensor having a field of view that includes the gate, the method further comprising identifying, by the processor, the gate sensor by analyzing consecutive state vectors.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein identifying the gate sensor includes identifying, by the processor, a state vector of inactivity preceded and succeeded by a state vector with at least one active motion sensor.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein identifying the state vector of inactivity comprises determining, by the processor, whether the state vector of inactivity has a duration that is greater than a threshold value.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein determining occupancy characteristics of the space by analyzing the state vectors comprises: calculating, by the processor, feature vectors from the sensor data, wherein the feature vectors include a sum of the number of active sensors and spatial correlation between consecutive state vectors; and using, by the processor, a classifier to interpret the feature vectors based on a learning set of feature vectors.
