FABRIC VALIDATION USING SPECTRAL MEASUREMENT
</title>

<abstract>
Fabric validation using spectral measurement is provided. In various embodiments, a near-infrared absorption spectrum of a fabric sample is received from a near-infrared spectrometer. A plurality of features is extracted from the spectrum. The plurality of features is provided to a trained classifier. The trained classifier provides a similarity score indicative of the similarity of the fabric sample to a reference fabric sample.
