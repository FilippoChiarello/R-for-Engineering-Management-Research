<abstract>
A search apparatus receives each input of a target value and a reference value indicated by the target value; generates a prediction model indicating a relation between the condition and the result based on a setting value of the condition inside the search area and a measured value of the result; acquires a prediction value from the prediction model by assigning the target value to the prediction model and specifies a presence area of the prediction value from the search area; determines whether the prediction value is closer to the target value than the reference value; sets the measured value of the result corresponding to the prediction value to the reference value when the prediction value is closer to the target value, and sets the prediction value presence area to the search area; and outputs a prediction value satisfying an achievement condition when the prediction value satisfies the achievement condition.
