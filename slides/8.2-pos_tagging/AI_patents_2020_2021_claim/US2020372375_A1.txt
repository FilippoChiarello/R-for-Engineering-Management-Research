<title>
Method and System for Predicting Crude Oil or Petroleum Products Loaded On-board Vessels
</title>

<abstract>
An accurate predictive methodology for crude oil markets. Use of both technology and domain expertise to build a robust predictor of crude oil cargo (and its derivatives) loading. The method relies on a plurality data sources to verify the accuracy of the data. AIS for locating a vessel and machine learning are employed for prediction. In some cases, crude oils are traded using a synonym. Synonyms have been accounted for in this method wherever available via an extensive commodity hierarchy taxonomy. The method provides benchmarking information on basis the port calls, SOFs (statements of facts) and ullage Reports to select the best berth for a commodity. The system and method provide for improved berth selection and facilitate quality improvements in cargo management systems. The method improves the currently available business intelligence related to cargo at berth and improves quality of information or shipping executives, managers, charterers and traders.

<claims>
1. A method for cargo volume analysis including: receiving AIS information at a server, said server coupled to a network, wherein said AIS information includes at least a vessel draft information and a location information; calculating a TPCI based on the vessel draft information; determining cargo type from the location information using predictive analytics; predicting a crude oil blend using prediction analytics, and determining the cargo volume from said predicting.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the prediction analytics includes applying association rules to a historical dataset.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein the association rules include information about the most frequent transactions and generates the most likely transactions.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein prediction analytics includes using an artificial neural network based on a historical dataset.
5. A method for analyzing maritime cargo including the steps of: receiving AIS information at a server, said server coupled to a network, said AIS information includes at least a vessel draft information and a location information; processing the AIS information to remove outliers, incomplete information, and to standardize the information format; effectuating association rules in response to said processing; applying the association rules in response to a query received at the server, and responding to the query with the results of the applying.
6. The method of claim 5 wherein the association rules are based on historic cargo information.
7. The method of claim 5 wherein the responding to the query includes a response with a crude oil blend information.
8. The method of claim 5 wherein the association rules include information about the most frequent transactions and generates the most likely transactions.
9. One or more processor-readable storage devices, said devices including non-transitory processor instructions directing a processor to perform a method including: receiving AIS information wherein said AIS information includes at least a vessel draft information and a location information; calculating a TPCI based on the vessel draft information; determining cargo type from the location information using predictive analytics; predicting a crude oil blend using prediction analytics, and determining the cargo volume from said predicting
10. The device of claim 9 wherein the prediction analytics includes applying association rules to a historical dataset.
11. The device of claim 9 wherein the association rules include information about the most frequent transactions and generates the most likely transactions.
12. The device of claim 9 wherein prediction analytics includes using an artificial neural network based on a historical dataset.
