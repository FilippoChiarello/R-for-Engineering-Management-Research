MULTI-TASK DEEP LEARNING METHOD FOR A NEURAL NETWORK FOR AUTOMATIC PATHOLOGY DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
Multi-task deep learning method for a neural network for automatic pathology detection, comprising the steps: receiving (S1) first image data (I) for a first image recognition task; receiving (S2) second image data (V) for a second image recognition task; wherein the first image data (I) is of a first datatype and the second image data (V) is of a second datatype, different from the first datatype; determining (S3) first labeled image data (IL) by labeling the first image data (I) and determining second synthesized labeled image data (ISL) by synthesizing and labeling the second image data (V); training (S4) the neural network based on the received first image data (I), the received second image data (V), the determined first labeled image data (IL) and the determined second labeled synthesized image data (ISL); wherein the first image recognition task and the second image recognition task relate to a same anatomic region where the respective image data is taken from and/or relate to a same pathology to be recognized in the respective image data.

<claims>
1. Multi-task deep learning method for a neural network for automatic pathology detection, comprising the steps:
receiving (SI) first image data (I) for a first image recognition task;
receiving (S2) second image data (V) for a second image recognition task; wherein the first image data (I) is of a first datatype and the second image data
(V) is of a second datatype, different from the first datatype;
determining (S3) first labeled image data (II) by labeling the first image data (I) and determining second labeled synthesized image data (ISL) by synthesizing and labeling the second image data (V);
training (S4) the neural network based on the received first image data (I), the received second image data (V), the determined first labeled image data (II) and the determined second labeled synthesized image data (ISL);
wherein the first image recognition task and the second image recognition task relate to a same anatomic region where the respective image data is taken from and/or relate to a same pathology to be recognized in the respective image data.
2. Method of any of claim 1, wherein the method comprises the steps:
determining synthesized second image data (Is) by synthesizing the second image data (V) into the first datatype and/or first dimension; and
determining the second labeled synthesiszed image data (ISL) by labeling the synthesized second image data (Is).
3. Method of any of claim 1, wherein the method comprises the steps:
determining second labeled image data by labeling the second image data (V); and
determining the second labeled synthesized image data (ISL) by synthesizing the second labeled image data into the first datatype and/or dimension of the first image data
(I)Â·
4. Method of any one of claims 1-3, wherein
the first image recognition task and/or the second image recognition task comprises classification, localization, object detection and/or segmentation.
5. Method of claim 4, wherein
classification, localization, object detection and/or segmentation relates to a pathology, a foreign object and/or an anatomical region.
6. Method of any of the preceding claims, wherein
the first datatype comprises 2D image data; and
wherein the second datatype comprises 3D image data.
7. Method of any of the preceding claims, wherein
the first image data (I) is of a first dimension and the second image data (V) is of a second dimension, different from the first dimension.
8. Method of any of the preceding claims, wherein
the first labeled image data (II) and the second labeled synthesized image data (ISL) comprises an identification and/or a location of a pathology, a foreign object and/or an anatomical region.
9. Method of any of the preceding claims, wherein
the first image data (I) comprises X-ray image data; and
wherein the second image data (V) comprises computer tomography image data.
10. Method of claim 9, wherein
the computer tomography image data is synthesized into 2D image data in form of a digitally reconstructed radiograph.
11. Method of any of the preceding claims, wherein the pathology comprises one of Cardiomegaly, Emphysema, Edema, Hernia, Pneumothorax, Effusion, Masses, Fibrosis, Atelectasis, Consolidation, Pleural Thickening, Nodules and Pneumonia. 12. Device (10), being configured for executing a method of any of claims 1 to 11.
13. Computer program, comprising instructions to cause a computer to execute a method of any of claims 1 to 11. 14. Computer-readable medium having stored thereon the computer program of claim 13.
