<title>
PERSONA-BASED CONTEXTUAL SECURITY
</title>

<abstract>
There is disclosed in one example a computing apparatus, including: a hardware platform including a processor and a memory; a contextual reputation store; and instructions encoded within the memory to provision a security agent configured to: create a user persona in the contextual reputation store based at least in part on the user's interaction with the computing apparatus; compute a persona-weighted reputation for an action and store the persona-weighted reputation action to the contextual reputation store; intercept a user action on the computing apparatus; determine a current user persona; determine from the contextual reputation store a persona-weighted reputation for the user action; and take a security action based at least in part on the persona-weighted reputation for the user action.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computing apparatus, comprising: a hardware platform comprising a processor and a memory; a contextual reputation store; and instructions encoded within the memory to provision a security agent configured to: create a user persona in the contextual reputation store based at least in part on the user's interaction with the computing apparatus; compute a persona-weighted reputation for an action and store the persona-weighted reputation action to the contextual reputation store; intercept a user action on the computing apparatus; determine a current user persona; determine from the contextual reputation store a persona-weighted reputation for the user action; and take a security action based at least in part on the persona-weighted reputation for the user action.
2. The computing apparatus of claim 1, wherein the security agent is further to enter or exit a user persona based at least in part on a persona trigger event.
3. The computing apparatus of claim 2, wherein the persona trigger event comprises opening or closing an application.
4. The computing apparatus of claim 2, wherein the persona trigger event comprises a change in mouse or keyboard focus.
5. The computing apparatus of claim 2, wherein the persona trigger event comprises access to a website.
6. The computing apparatus of claim 2, wherein the persona trigger event comprises accessing an e-mail address.
7. The computing apparatus of claim 2, wherein the persona trigger event comprises a time of day.
8. The computing apparatus of claim 1, wherein the user action is an administrative action.
9. The computing apparatus of claim 1, wherein determining the persona-weighted reputation comprises comparing a speed of actions taken to a human-capable speed.
10. The computing apparatus of claim 1, wherein determining the persona-weighted reputation comprises determining a strength of user authentication.
11. The computing apparatus of claim 1, wherein the instructions are to provision the security agent at a privilege ring more privileged than user-space applications.
12. The computing apparatus of claim 1, wherein the system agent includes a continuous system event monitor.
13. The computing apparatus of claim 1, wherein the contextual reputation store includes a default persona for actions not falling within a persona otherwise defined.
14. The computing apparatus of claim 1, wherein the security action is selected from the group consisting of allow, deny, and warn.
15. One or more tangible, non-transitory computer-readable mediums having stored thereon executable instructions to: profile a user's use of a computing apparatus; create a first user persona from the user of the computing apparatus, including a trigger for entering the first persona; define a first persona-specific score for a user action by a user operating within the first user persona; detect an instance of the user action while a user operates within the first persona; compute a reputation for the action from the persona-specific score; and take a security action according to the reputation.
16. The one or more tangible, non-transitory computer-readable mediums of claim 15, wherein the instructions are further to enter or exit a user persona based at least in part on a persona trigger event.
17. The one or more tangible, non-transitory computer-readable mediums of claim 16, wherein the persona trigger event is selected from the group consisting of opening an application, closing an application, a change in mouse or keyboard focus, accessing a website, accessing an e-mail address, and a time of day.
18. The one or more tangible, non-transitory computer-readable mediums of claim 15, wherein the instructions are further to define a second persona for the user, including a trigger for entering the second persona, and to assign a second persona-specific score to the action, the second persona-specific score different from the first persona-specific score.
19. A computer-implemented method of providing persona-based contextual security, comprising: generating a plurality of personas for a single user of a computing device based on the single user's varying patterns of usage in different computing contexts; defining a first persona-specific reputation for an action anticipated to be taken by the user in a first persona of the plurality of personas; entering a context of the first persona according to a first persona trigger; detecting an instance of the action within the first persona; determining a response to the action from the persona-specific reputation; and enacting the response.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein the plurality of personas further comprises a second persona for the user, including a second persona trigger, and a second persona-specific reputation for the action different from the first persona-specific reputation for the action.
