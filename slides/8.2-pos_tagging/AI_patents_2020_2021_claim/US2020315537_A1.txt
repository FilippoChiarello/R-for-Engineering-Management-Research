34. The patch of claim 33, wherein the body layer comprises one or more electrical contacts configured to convey electrode data to the at least one reusable portion.
35. The patch of claim 32, wherein the reusable portion comprises one or more electronic modules, wherein the communication interface is provided on the one or more electronic modules.
36. The patch of claim 32, wherein the at least one reusable portion connects with the at least one disposable portion with aid of one or more magnets.
37. The patch of claim 30, wherein the communication interface comprises one or more radio transmitters or receivers.
38. The patch of claim 37, wherein the communication interface comprises at least one narrowband radio transmitter, receiver, or transceiver, and at least one ultrawideband radio transmitter, receiver, or transceiver.
39. The patch of claim 30, wherein the mobile device is a smartphone.
40. The patch of claim 30, wherein the plurality of applications comprise two or more use cases selected from the group consisting of: cardiac care, sleep apnea, athlete fitness, infant monitoring, senior living, pet monitoring, gait analysis, mental stress, emotional states, or fall detection.
41. The patch of claim 30, wherein the patch is configured to positioned on the subject's torso to collect the health related data.
42. The patch of claim 30, wherein the plurality of applications are capable of providing analytics for a plurality of use cases by relying on data from the plurality of sensors of the patch alone without requiring additional data from any other sensors.
43. A method of monitoring health related conditions of a subject, the method comprising: (a) receiving data from the patch of claim 30, wherein the patch is attached to the subject; (b) analyzing the data, with aid of an application on the mobile device that utilizes the data from a first subset of sensors of the plurality of sensors, wherein the mobile device is capable of running at least one other application that utilizes data from a second subset of sensors different from the first subset of sensors; and (c) wirelessly transmitting information to be displayed on a wearable device worn by the subject.
44. The method of claim 43, wherein the wearable device is a watch configured to be worn on a wrist of the subject.
45. The method of claim 43, wherein the information is displayed on a screen of the wearable device, and wherein the information is displayed in a format based on an application type, for the application on the mobile device.
46. The method of claim 45, wherein the format includes one or more of the following: time chart, histogram, trends over time, cool diagram, evaluation, statements, message, pie chart, or event markers.
47. The method of claim 43, further comprising transmitting health related information to the cloud.
48. The method of claim 43, wherein the health related information is analyzed with aid of one or more machine learning applications.
49. The method of claim 43, wherein selection of the application automatically results in a selection of one or more sensors from the plurality of sensors to provide the data to be analyzed.
