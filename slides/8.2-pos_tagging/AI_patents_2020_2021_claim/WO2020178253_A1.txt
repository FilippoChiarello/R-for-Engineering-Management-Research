APPARATUS FOR MONITORING A SWITCHGEAR
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for monitoring a switchgear. The apparatus comprises an input unit, a processing unit, and an output unit. The input unit is configured to provide the processing unit with a monitor infra-red image of a switchgear. The processing unit is configured to implement a machine learning classifier algorithm to analyse the monitor infra-red image and determine if there is one or more anomalous hot spots in the switchgear. The machine learning classifier algorithm has been trained on the basis of a plurality of different training infra-red images. The plurality of training infra-red images comprises a plurality of modified infrared images generated from a corresponding plurality of infra-red images. Each of the modified infra-red images has been modified to remove the effect of obscuration in the image. The output unit is configured to output information relating to the one or more anomalous hot spots.
