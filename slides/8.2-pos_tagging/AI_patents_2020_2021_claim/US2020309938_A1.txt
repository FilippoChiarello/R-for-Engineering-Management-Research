A METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DETECTION OF A TARGET BY A PASSIVE RADAR SYSTEM EXPLOITING MULTICHANNEL-PER-CARRIER ILLUMINATOR SOURCES
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for detection of a target by a passive radar system exploiting multichannel-per-carrier cellular illuminator sources, the method including: receiving a reference signal from a reference source, said reference signal being received at a reference element of a radar receiver of the passive radar system; receiving, at a surveillance element of said radar receiver, a reflected signal originating from said reference source and reflected off the target, said reflected signal including interference; deciphering components of said signals; and reconstructing said signals, from said components, excluding said interference.

<claims>
1. A method for detection of a target by a passive radar system exploiting multichannel-per-carrier cellular illuminator sources, the method comprising: receiving a reference signal from a reference source, said reference signal being received at a reference element of a radar receiver of the passive radar system; receiving, at a surveillance element of said radar receiver, a reflected signal originating from said reference source and reflected off the target, said reflected signal including interference; deciphering components of said signals; and reconstructing said signals, from said components, excluding said interference.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein said deciphering and reconstructing include: filtering said reference signal using Space Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) algorithms to receive a selective reference channel; applying a Conditioning algorithm to obtain a clean reference cell signal replica, with interfering signals and multipaths of said interfering signals removed, resulting in a conditioned signal; filtering said reflected signal using said STAP algorithms; removing direct interference from said reflected signal, with a Clean algorithm using said conditioned signal, said conditioned signal being passed through a filter representing a transfer function between said reference element and said surveillance element, and subtracting a resulting signal from said reflected signal; and reconstructing said surveillance signal by successively subjecting said reflected signal to at least one iteration of a Suppression algorithm, resulting in a refined reflected signal.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: performing a Cross Ambiguity Function (CAF) between a refined reference signal and said conditioned signal , resulting in a Range Doppler Image for every reception dwell; estimating the Angle of Arrival (AOA) of the target, in azimuth and elevation, using amplitude and phase of same pixel in different channels of said reflected signal, said estimating only being executed on pixels extracted by a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) mechanism; applying a Track Before Detect (TBD) algorithm to the target; establishing Plot reports; obtaining location and velocity estimates; and displaying said plots.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein said Conditioning algorithm comprises the steps of: fitting a Down Link Scrambling Code (DLSC) to said reference signal; correcting a receiver Local Oscillator to an interfering cell carrier frequency; estimating a transfer function of a medium interposed between an input of a transmitter of said reference source and an output of said radar receiver of the passive radar system; reconstructing a source signal, said source signal being a signal originally transmitted from said reference source; and transforming said reconstructed source signal by said estimated transfer function, thereby obtaining an estimate of said reference signal, wherein said estimate is said conditioned signal.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein said DLSC is found by detecting a Primary Synchronization Code (PSC) and a Secondary Synchronization Code (SSC) and inferring said DLSC from said SSC sequence.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein said DLSC is dictated from an external knowledge base.
7. The method of claim 4, wherein reconstructing said source signal includes: determining active Orthogonal Variable Spreading Factor (OVSF) channels; estimating and reconstructing symbols of said channels; and adding reconstructed synchronizations.
8. The method of claim 2, wherein said Suppression algorithm comprises the steps of: fitting a Down Link Scrambling Code (DLSC) to said reference signal; correcting a receiver Local Oscillator to an interfering cell carrier frequency; estimating a transfer function of a medium interposed between an input of a transmitter of said reference source and an output of said radar receiver of the passive radar system; reconstructing a source signal, said source signal being a signal originally transmitted from said reference source; transforming said reconstructed source signal by said estimated transfer function, thereby obtaining an estimate of said interfering signal; subtracting said estimate of said interfering signal from an input residual signal in order to establish a new residual signal; and checking whether all DLSCs have been used, such that if all said DLSCs have been used, said new residual signal is said output of said radar receiver, otherwise, change DLSC to an unused DLSC and perform said Suppression algorithm again with said new residual signal.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein said reconstructing said source signal comprises: reconstructing a Primary Synchronization Code (PSC), a Secondary Synchronization Code (SSC) and a Common Pilot Channel (CPICH) by: constructing each of said PSC, SSC and CPICH using a known algorithm such that a number of samples per chip accords with a sampling rate, synchronizing each of said PSC, SSC and CPICH with said input residual signal or new residual signal by locating a maximal correlation between each of said PSC, SSC and CPICH and said received signal, and duplicating each of said PSC, SSC and CPICH to a same length of said residual signal; passing said reconstructed PSC, SSC and CPICH components through said estimated transfer function, in order to translate said reconstructed components at an input of said reference source to an output of said radar receiver; subtracting said reconstructed signals, estimated at said output of said radar receiver, from said input residual signal; descrambling said received signal or said input residual signal; despreading said received signal; extracting a data signal from said despreaded signal; reconstructing a component signal associated with a channelization code so as to receive a spreaded reconstructed signal; scrambling said spreaded reconstructed signal by chip-wise multiplication of a DLSC constructed in said despreading step; repeating reconstruction of said spreaded components for all valid channelization codes; and accumulating said reconstructed signal components so as to return an estimate of said source signal at said input of said reference source
10. The method of claim 4, wherein said LO correction is achieved by fitting a complex sinusoid to a Common Pilot Channel (CPICH) signal or equivalent thereof, and correcting said signal received from said interfering cell by an estimated frequency of said fitted complex sinusoid.
11. A passive radar system configured to exploit multichannel-per-carrier cellular illuminator sources, the system comprising: a radar receiver including: a reference antenna element configured to receive a reference signal from a reference source, and a surveillance antenna element configured to receive a reflected signal originating from said reference source and reflected off a target, wherein said reflected signal includes interference; and a signal processor configured to analyze said received signals and perform and computations to decipher components of said received reference and reflected signals in order to identify said interference and reconstruct said signals from said components, without said interference.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein said LO correction is achieved by fitting a complex sinusoid to a Common Pilot Channel (CPICH) signal or equivalent thereof, and correcting said signal received from said interfering cell by an estimated frequency of said fitted complex sinusoid.
