</title>

<abstract>
Formulations and methods for treating fibromyalgia or chronic pain in humans comprising chronically administering to a human patient experiencing fibromyalgia who is experiencing insulin resistance a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a drug that treats insulin resistance and a therapeutically effective amount of a drug for treating the pain associated with fibromyalgia. In certain preferred embodiments, the formulation is an oral solid dosage form.

<claims>
1. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a drug that treats insulin resistance, and a therapeutic amount of a drug for treating the pain associated with fibromyalgia.
2. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the drug for treating insulin resistance is selected from the group consisting of a biguanide, indole- 3 -propionic acid, a PPARy agonist, a glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP-1) agonist, a DPP-4 inhibitor, and combinations of any of the foregoing.
3. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 2, wherein the drug which treats insulin resistance is
(i) a biguanide selected from the group consisting of glipizide, glyburide, pioglitazone, repaglinide, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, and metformin; or
(ii) a DDP-4 inhibitor selected from the group consisting of sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, and linagliptin; or
(iii) a GLP-1 agonist selected from the group consisting of exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide; or
(iv) a PPARy agonist.
4. The pharmaceutical composition of claims 1 or 2, wherein the drug for treating the pain associated with fibromyalgia is selected from the group consisting of a tricyclic antidepressant, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, an atypical antidepressant, a drug with membrane-stabilizing properties, and combinations of any of the foregoing.
5. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 4, wherein the drug for treating pain associated with fibromyalgia is (i) a tricyclic antidepressant selected from the group consisting of amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin, imipramine, nortriptyline, amoxapine, clomipramine, maprotiline, trimipramine, and protriptyline; or
(ii) an atypical antidepressant selected from the group consisting of bupropion, trazodone, and mirtazapine; or
(iii) a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) selected from the group consisting of venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, milnacipran, duloxetine, and levomilnacipran; or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) selected from the group consisting of fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, citalopram, vilazodone, and vortioxetine; or
(iv) a drug with membrane-stabilizing properties selected from the group consisting of gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine.
6. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the therapeutic amount of a drug for treating the pain associated with fibromyalgia comprises from about 25 mg to about 200 mg desipramine.
7. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the therapeutic amount of a drug for treating the pain associated with fibromyalgia comprises from about 10 mg to about 375 mg venlafaxine.
8. The pharmaceutical composition of claims 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 or 7 wherein the therapeutic amount of a drug for treating insulin resistance is from about 100 mg to about 2000 mg metformin.
9. The pharmaceutical composition of claims 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7 wherein the therapeutically effective amount of a drug that treats insulin resistance comprises from about 1 mg to about 500 mg sitagliptin.
10. A pharmaceutical composition for use in treating fibromyalgia in humans, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a drug that treats insulin resistance and a therapeutically effective amount of a drug for treating the pain associated with fibromyalgia, wherein the composition is chronically administered to a human patient experiencing fibromyalgia who is experiencing insulin resistance.
11. A pharmaceutical composition for use in treating chronic pain in humans, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a drug that treats insulin resistance and a therapeutically effective amount of a drug for treating the pain associated with fibromyalgia, wherein the composition is chronically administered to a human patient experiencing chronic pain who is experiencing insulin resistance.
12. The method of claims 10 or 11, wherein the drug for treating insulin resistance is selected from the group consisting of a biguanide, indole-3 -propionic acid, a PPARy agonist, a glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP-1) agonist, a DPP-4 inhibitor, and combinations of any of the foregoing and the drug for treating pain associated with fibromyalgia is selected from the group consisting of a tricyclic antidepressant, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, an atypical
antidepressant, a drug with membrane-stabilizing properties, and combinations of any of the foregoing.
