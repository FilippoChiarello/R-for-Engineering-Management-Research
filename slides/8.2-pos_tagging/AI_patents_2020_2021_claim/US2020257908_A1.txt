<title>
Blind spot implementation in neural networks
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for implementing blind spots into neural network models are disclosed. In some example embodiments, a computer-implemented method comprises obtaining an image captured within a field of view of an image capture device and comprising an object of a particular type occupying a particular position within the field of view, and determining a confidence value for the object based on the particular position of the object using a neural network model. The confidence value represents a likelihood that the object is an object of interest, and the neural network model is trained to generate lower confidence values for objects of the particular type when the objects of the particular type are occupying the particular position than when the objects of the particular type are not occupying the particular position.
