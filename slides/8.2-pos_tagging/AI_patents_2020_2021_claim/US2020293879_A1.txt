<title>
Scalable Extensible Neural Network System and Methods
</title>

<abstract>
A neural network system, involving a neural network, the neural network configured to: map sensor output to a Level 1 input; learn to fuse the time slices for one class, learning comprising taking and feeding a random assignment of inputs from each time slice into a threshold function for another two-dimensional array; learn to reject class bias for completing network training; use cycles for class recognition, and fuse segments for intelligent information dominance and a magnetic headwear apparatus operably coupled with the neural network.
