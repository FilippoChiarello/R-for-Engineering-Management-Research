SIGNAL REPLAY FOR SELECTION OF OPTIMAL DETECTION SETTINGS
</title>

<abstract>
A method for adjusting parameters of a medical device includes collecting patient data by using the medical device, in which the medical device includes programmable parameters for affecting a function carried out by the medical device, transmitting the patient data to an external device, conducting an analysis of the transmitted patient data by using the external device, and providing an automatically computed proposal for adjusting at least one parameter, several parameters or all of the parameters based on the analysis. A corresponding system is also provided.

<claims>
1. A method for adjusting parameters of a medical device, the method comprising the following steps: collecting patient data of a patient by using the medical device, the medical device including programmable parameters for affecting a function carried out by the medical device; transmitting the patient data to an external device; conducting an analysis of the transmitted patient data by using the external device; and providing an automatically computed proposal to a physician for adjusting at least one of the parameters, or several of said parameters, or all of the parameters based on the analysis.
2. The method according to claim 1, which further comprises using the medical device to carry out the function by executing an algorithm implemented in the medical device, the algorithm utilizing the programmable parameters to achieve a classification of clinical events contained in the patient data.
3. The method according to claim 1, which further comprises carrying out the step of collecting the patient data by using the medical device to measure an ECG of the patient.
4. The method according to claim 1, which further comprises storing the collected patient data in the external device.
5. The method according to claim 1, which further comprises storing the collected patient data in the external device for later review.
6. The method according to claim 1, which further comprises carrying out the step of conducting the analysis by carrying out an analysis algorithm on the external device, applying the analysis algorithm to the collected patient data for a plurality of different settings of each parameter, and for each setting of the parameters storing a classification of the clinical events obtained by the algorithm executed on the external device.
7. The method according to claim 6, which further comprises using a human expert or an expert system to independently process the classifications of the clinical events made by the analysis algorithm executed on the external device to adjudicate them as true or false.
8. The method according to claim 7, which further comprises adapting the automatically computed proposal to reduce false classifications of clinical events made by the analysis algorithm and increase true classifications when the respective parameter is adjusted according to the proposal.
9. The method according to claim 3, wherein the function corresponds to one of: detecting of P, Q, R, S, and T waves in the ECG, detecting of atrial fibrillation in the ECG, detecting of bradycardia in the ECG, detecting of an asystole in the ECG, detecting of a high ventricular rate in the ECG detecting a sudden rate drop in the ECG.
10. The method according to claim 1, which further comprises adjusting the parameters of the medical device by using the external device, or another external device or an external data center by wireless programming.
11. A system for adjusting medical parameters, the system comprising: a medical device configured to collect patient data of a patient, said medical device being configured to perform a function and including programmable parameters for affecting said function; and an external device configured to receive said collected patient data transmitted by said medical device, said external device being configured to conduct an analysis of said transmitted patient data, and said external device being configured to provide a proposal to a physician for adjusting at least one of said parameters, several of said parameters, or all of said parameters using said analysis.
12. The system according to claim 11, wherein said medical device is configured to carry out said function by executing an algorithm implemented in said medical device, said algorithm utilizing said programmable parameters to achieve a classification of clinical events contained in said patient data.
13. The system according to claim 11, wherein said collected patient data is an ECG of the patient.
14. The system according to claim 11, wherein said external device is configured to conduct said analysis by executing said analysis algorithm on said external device and applying said algorithm to said collected patient data for a plurality of different settings of each parameter, said external device being configured to store classifications of clinical events obtained by said algorithm executed on said external device for each setting of said parameters.
15. The system according to claim 14, wherein the system is configured to receive, as an input, adjudications by a human expert or an expert system as to whether said classification of said respective clinical event made by said algorithm executed on said external device is true or false.
16. The system according to claim 11, wherein the system is configured to adapt said automatically computed proposal such that false classifications of clinical events made by said algorithm are reduced when said respective parameter is adjusted according to said proposal.
17. The system according to claim 13, wherein said function corresponds to one of: detecting of P, Q, R, S, and T waves in the ECG, detecting of atrial fibrillation in the ECG, detecting of bradycardia in the ECG, detecting of an asystole in the ECG, detecting of a high ventricular rate in the ECG, detecting of a sudden rate drop in the ECG.
