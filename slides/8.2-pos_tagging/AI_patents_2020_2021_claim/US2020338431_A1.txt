ROBOTIC TRAINING SYSTEMS AND METHODS
</title>

<abstract>
A robotic athletic training system may include a mobile robotic platform, a sensor module associated with the mobile robotic platform and configured to obtain data from an environment. The system may include a drive system that propels the platform, as well as a steering system that steers the platform. The system may include a processor which receives data from the sensor module and control the drive system or steering system to follow a path based on the data received from the sensor module. A method may include controlling a robotic athletic training system (or robotic training platform) so that it moves at a velocity. The robotic athletic training system may include a vision system configured to receive data related to a surface and compare a baseline data of a desired surface to the received data and adjusting a travel direction of the robotic system in response to the comparison.

5. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to provide coaching to the individual in response to a variation in the physiological characteristic.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the physiological characteristic is a gait characteristic. The system of claim 1, wherein the physiological characteristic comprises one of fatigue and perspiration level.
8. The system of claim 1, further comprising: a display system configured to provide information about a workout program to the individual during the athletic activity.
9. A robotic athletic training system for assisting an individual during an athletic activity in an environment, comprising: a mobile robotic platform; a sensor module; a drive system configured to propel the mobile robotic platform; a steering system configured to steer the mobile robotic platform; a processor configured to receive data from the sensor module and to control one of the drive system and the steering system to follow a path based on the data; and a video camera configured to record video data of a path ahead of the individual during the athletic activity and to transmit the video data to the processor, wherein the processor is configured to analyze a route traversed by the individual based on the video data.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the video camera is further configured to record first person-style view video data of the route traversed.
11. The system of claim 9, wherein the video camera is further configured to pan around the environment to record video data of the environment.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the video camera is further configured to pan via control by at least one of the individual or a third party.
13. The system of claim 9, wherein the mobile robotic platform is land based.
14. The system of claim 9, wherein the mobile robotic platform is aerial based.
15. The system of claim 9, wherein the mobile robotic platform is configured to work with a second mobile robotic platform.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the position of the second mobile robotic platform is based upon position of the mobile robotic platform.
17. A method of assisting an individual during an athletic activity in an environment using a robotic athletic training system, comprising: controlling the robotic athletic training system to move the robotic athletic training system; receiving video data of a path ahead of the individual during the athletic activity from a video camera of the robotic athletic training system; analyzing the path based on the video data of the path; and displaying information on the path related to the athletic activity.
18. The method of claim 17, further comprising: providing coaching feedback to the individual during the athletic activity.
19. The method of claim 18, further comprising: the robotic athletic training system communicating with a second robotic athletic training system, wherein the the robotic athletic training system is land based, and wherein the second robotic athletic training system is aerial based.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein the second the robotic athletic training system records video data of the environment.
