Guided wave launcher with reflector and methods for use therewith
</title>

<abstract>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, a guided wave launcher includes an array of antennas that generates first near field signals. A reflector is configured to guide the first near field signals to a surface of a transmission medium, the first near field signals inducing a first guided electromagnetic wave that is guided by the surface of the transmission medium and propagates along the transmission medium without requiring an electrical return path.

<claims>
1. A guided wave launcher comprising: an array of antennas that generates first near field signals; and a reflector configured to guide the first near field signals to a surface of a transmission medium, the first near field signals inducing a first guided electromagnetic wave that is guided by the surface of the transmission medium and propagates along the transmission medium without requiring an electrical return path.
2. The guided wave launcher of claim 1, wherein a longitudinal axis of each antenna of the array of antennas is parallel to, and spaced a distance apart from, a longitudinal axis of the transmission medium.
3. The guided wave launcher of claim 2, wherein the reflector has an aspheric surface that is tilted at an off-axis orientation from the longitudinal axis of each antenna of the array of antennas.
4. The guided wave launcher of claim 3, wherein the first near field signals are emitted along the longitudinal axis of each antenna of the array of antennas, the first near field signals are reflected by the aspheric surface of the reflector to guide the first near field signals to the surface of the transmission medium.

8. The guided wave launcher of claim 1, further comprising: a circuit board that supports the array of antennas.
9. The guided wave launcher of claim 1, wherein the array of antennas is further configured to receive second near field signals guided by the reflector in response to a second guided electromagnetic wave that propagates along the surface of the transmission medium, wherein the second guided electromagnetic wave propagates along the surface of the transmission medium without requiring the electrical return path.
10. The guided wave launcher of claim 1, wherein the first near field signals are in a microwave range of frequencies.
11. A method comprising: generating first near field signals via an array of antennas; and guiding, via a reflective surface, the first near field signals to a surface of a transmission medium, the first near field signals inducing a first guided electromagnetic wave that is guided by the surface of the transmission medium and propagates along the transmission medium without requiring an electrical return path.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein a longitudinal axis of each antenna of the array of antennas is parallel to, and spaced a distance apart from, a longitudinal axis of the transmission medium.
