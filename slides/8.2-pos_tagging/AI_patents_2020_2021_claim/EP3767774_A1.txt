CURRENT CONTROL METHOD AND CURRENT CONTROL DEVICE FOR ON-VEHICLE BATTERY CHARGERS
</title>

<abstract>
By using the current control method and the current control device for an on-board charger according to the present invention, when an on-board charger is controlled that supplies current to high-power components and a battery, current control is executed to supply output current to the high-power components and the battery, wherein the output current is the sum of the drive current to be supplied to high-power components configured to compute current consumption based on their own operating states and the charging current to the battery.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A current control method for an on-board charger that supplies current to high-power components and a battery, comprising: identifying first high-power components configured to compute current consumption based on their own operating states from among the high-power components; computing a sum of a charging current of the battery and a drive current to be supplied to the first high-power components as an output current; and supplying the output current from the on-board charger to the high-power components and the battery.
2. The current control method according to claim 1, wherein
the high-power components includes second high-power components not configured to compute current consumption based on their own operating states.
3. The current control method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein
before changing the operating state of one of the first high-power components,
determining whether it is possible to carry out tracking control in which the on-board charger reduces the output current in accordance with a decrease in the current consumption of the first high-power component due to the change, and
upon determining that the tracking control is not possible,
the sum of the charging current and the current consumption of the first high-power components after the change is computed as a target current, and
the operating state is changed after reducing the output current to the target current.
4. The current control method according to claim 3, wherein
upon determining that the tracking control is possible,
the operating state is changed, and the tracking control is carried out.
5. A current control method for an on-board charger that supplies current to a battery and high-power components configured to compute current consumption based on their own operating states, comprising: computing a sum of a charging current of the battery and a drive current to be supplied to the high-power components as an output current; and supplying the output current from the on-board charger to the high-power components and the battery.
6. The current control method according to claim 5, wherein
before changing the operating state of one of the high-power components, determining whether it is possible to carry out tracking control in which the on-board charger reduces the output current in accordance with a decrease in the current consumption of the high-power component due to the change, and
upon determining that the tracking control is not possible,
the sum of the charging current and the current consumption of the high-power components after the change is computed as a target current, and
the operating state is changed after reducing the output current to the target current.
7. The current control method according to claim 6, wherein
upon determining that the tracking control is possible,
the operating state is changed, and the tracking control is carried out.
8. A current control device for an on-board charger that supplies current to high-power components and a battery, comprising: a characteristic determination circuit configured to identify first high-power components configured to compute current consumption based on their own operating states from among the high-power components; a calculation circuit configured to compute a sum of a charging current to the battery and a drive current to be supplied to the first high-power components as an output current; and a command output circuit that outputs to the on-board charger a command to supply the output current from the on-board charger to the high-power components and the battery.
9. A current control device for an on-board charger that supplies current to a battery and high-power components configured to compute current consumption based on their own operating states, comprising;
a calculation circuit configured to compute a sum of a charging current of the battery and a drive current to be supplied to the high-power components as an output current; and
a command output circuit that outputs to the on-board charger a command to supply the output current from the on-board charger to the high-power components and the battery.
