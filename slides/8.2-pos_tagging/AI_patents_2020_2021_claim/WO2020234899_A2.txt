METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR ADAPTIVE LEARNING OF MODELS FOR MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
This disclosure relates to a method and system for adaptive learning of physics-based models, data-driven models and hybrid models used in an industrial manufacturing plant. A model-based optimization and advisory device (MOAD) is configured for monitoring performance of data-driven and physics-based models of industrial process units in real-time, computing model quality index for models, triggering adaptive learning of these models and in case of drift in predictions, diagnosing the reasons for drift in predictions. Suggesting re-tuning, re-building and recreating of the models to achieve highest prediction quality, and automatic deployment of latest models. The method and system ensures that the models of industrial manufacturing plant that provide critical operational decisions to the operators are kept up-to-date with minimal human intervention, while ensuring that adaptive learning is executed only when required and not on the basis of the amount of newer operational data accumulated or the time elapsed since model deployment.
