<title>
Merging feature subsets using graphical representation
</title>

<abstract>
A system, method and computer program product provides improved performance in machine learning, decision making and similar processes. In one example method, a plurality of individual subsets of features of a dataset comprising multiple features are received. The subsets may be provided by applying one or more feature selection methods to the dataset. Each subset is represented as a graph based on a predefined graph template. The example method merges the graphs of the plurality of individual subsets by overlaying the graphs on each other to form a merged feature graph. The merged feature graph may be used for identifying a single subset of features for use in machine learning, decision making and similar processes.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: receiving a plurality of individual subsets of features of a dataset of features, each subset represented as a graph based on a predefined template, wherein each received subset of features includes relevance data representing relevance or relative relevance of features within the subset; for each received subset of features, processing the relevance data associated with the features of the subset to determine an edge weight for each of the edges of the graph, wherein the edge weight represents a relationship between the feature pair represented by the pair of nodes connected by the corresponding edge, wherein the relevance data comprises, or may be used to derive, a distance between a pair of features in the subset of features, wherein an edge weight for an edge between a pair of nodes representing a feature pair is determined based on a formula in which the edge weight is inversely proportional to the distance between the feature pair; merging the plurality of graphs by combining nodes representing a same feature of the graphs and combining edge weights representing a same relationship between features to form a merged feature graph; determining a relevance score for each of the features; determining a super-set graph comprising nodes in the merged feature graph having a relevance score above a threshold relevance score; displaying the super-set graph to a user to enable the user to select aspects of the super-set graph to be included as a training graph, wherein displaying the super-set graph comprises displaying how nodes and edges were determined; and training a machine learning model based on the training graph.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the received relevance data comprises, a rank value of each feature of the subset of features based on the relevance value, wherein weighted edge value is calculated using the following formula:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?Edge Weight=[1/(1+Pos. Diff)]*[W*e{circumflex over ( )}(âˆ’Decay/5)]description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"? Wherein Pos. Diff is the difference in position between the feature pair in the feature ranking; W is a weight for decay, and Decay is top position of any two connected features in the feature ranking, starting from 0.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: using the merged feature graph to identify the single subset of features by selecting a subset of features from the merged feature graph based on one or more of: all of the features represented by nodes in the merged feature graph; a threshold number of the most relevant features represented by nodes in the merged feature graph; all features represented by nodes in the merged feature graph meeting a threshold relevance value; all features of feature pairs represented by edges in the merged feature graph meeting a threshold merged edge weight, and features represented by nodes or connected by edges in the merged feature graph meeting any other suitable threshold.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: presenting a visualized representation of the merged feature graph, to enable user selection of the single subset of features.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the received plurality of subsets of features of the dataset are generated using two or more feature selection methods.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: selecting a single subset of features using the merged feature graph; creating a model using training data based on the single subset of features, and applying the model to live and/or real world data in a system.
