IMPLEMENTATION OF MACHINE-LEARNING BASED QUERY CONSTRUCTION AND PATTERN IDENTIFICATION THROUGH VISUALIZATION IN USER INTERFACES
</title>

<abstract>
A computer system, computer-implemented method, and computer program product include a processor(s) (executing code) that obtains a data set(s) related to a patient population diagnosed with a medical condition a database(s). The processor(s) identifies common features, generates patterns of the common features, and generates machine learning algorithms based on the patterns to identify presence or absence of the given medical condition in an undiagnosed patient. The processor(s) compiles a training set of data and tunes the machine learning algorithms with the training set of data. The processor(s) integrates the machine learning algorithms into a graphical user interface. The processor(s) obtains data related to the undiagnosed patient via the interface and applies the machine learning algorithms to determine a probability (numerical value indicating a percentage of commonality between the data related to the undiagnosed patient and the one or more patterns) and display the probability as a score in the interface.
