<abstract>
A method, enterprise information handling system (IHS), and a computer-readable storage medium provide for mitigating a noncompliant configuration of an IHS. A determination is made whether a triggering event has occurred that has a potential for degrading compliance of the enterprise IHS. In response to determining that the triggering event has occurred, a controller performs a configuration scan of the hardware and software of the enterprise IHS to obtain current configuration information. The controller determines changes in the current configuration information based on a comparison of the current configuration information with baseline configuration information that was obtained in response to a previous triggering event. A determination is made whether any changes determined in the current configuration information are non-compliant based on a comparison to compliance status information. The controller enables the enterprise IHS to perform a compliance remediation operation in response to determining that at least one change is non-compliant.
