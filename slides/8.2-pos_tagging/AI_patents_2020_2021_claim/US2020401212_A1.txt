METHOD AND SYSTEM OF AUGMENTED-REALITY SIMULATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
In one aspect, a method includes the step of obtaining a digital image of an object with a digital camera. The object is identified. A user query is received. The method includes the step of matching, with at least one processor, the user query with at least one manipulable portion of a virtual view of the digital image of the object. The method includes the step of obtaining the at least one manipulable portion from a database of manipulable portions of the object. The method includes the step of integrating the at least one manipulable portion with the virtual view of the digital image of the object, wherein a manipulable portion comprises a region of an augmented-reality element integrated into the virtual view of the digital image of the object, and wherein the augmented-reality element comprises a hyper link to another augmented-reality element comprising an exterior interior view of the object.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computerized-method comprising: obtaining a digital image of an object with a digital camera; receiving a user query; matching, with at least one processor, the user query with at least one manipulable portion of a virtual view of the digital image of the object; obtaining the at least one manipulable portion from a database of manipulable portions of the object; integrating the at least one manipulable portion with the virtual view of the digital image of the object, wherein a manipulable portion comprises a region of an augmented-reality element integrated into the virtual view of the digital image of the object, wherein the augmented-reality element comprises a hyper link to another augmented-reality element comprising an exterior interior view of the object, wherein a user access the other augmented-reality element by performing a predefined user gesture with respect to a location of the object that corresponds to the at least one manipulable portion, and wherein the digital camera obtains the predefined user gesture; and displaying the at least one manipulable portion in the virtual view of the digital image of the object and the augmented-reality element is displayed with a computer display.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the object comprises a building.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, wherein the manipulable portion of the building comprises a wall region inside of the building.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 3, wherein the user gesture comprises a pointing motion with a hand of the user.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, wherein the other augmented reality portion comprises a digital image of a view of one or more connected exterior rooms of the building.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 5, wherein the digital image is obtained from a database of digital images comprising interior rooms of the building.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 6, wherein the computer display comprises an augmented reality goggles display system.
8. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the exterior view comprises a hybrid view.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 8, wherein a set of hybrid augmented elements completes the virtual exterior view.
10. The computer-implemented method of claim 9, wherein the hybrid view comprises an augmented reality elements that completes the item and connects to the item.
11. The computer-implemented method of claim 10, wherein a multiple set of external hybrid views are searchable.
12. The computer-implemented method of claim 10, wherein the augmented reality elements are configured to be minimized into one or more new forms.
13. A method of an augmented-reality simulation comprises: providing, with at least one processor, an augmented-reality view with a display of a computing device, wherein the augmented-reality includes a physical object and at least one augmented-reality element; obtaining a digital image of a symbolic input drawn by a user, wherein the digital image obtained from digital camera system of the computing device; obtaining at least one digital image of a first user hand gesture with respect to the symbolic input drawn by the user; providing a one or more set of manipulable portions of the augmented reality element; determining which of the one or more set of manipulable portions are relevant to the symbolic input and the first user hand gesture; automatically identifying the physical object with an image recognition system; receiving a user query via a user input system of the computer device; matching, with at least one processor, the user query with at least one manipulable portion of the augmented-reality view; obtaining the at least one manipulable portion from a database of manipulable portions associated with the physical object; integrating the at least one manipulable portion with the augmented-reality view, wherein a manipulable portion includes a region of the augmented-reality element integrated into the augmented-reality view, and wherein the augmented-reality element includes a hyper link to another augmented-reality element comprising a virtual exterior view of the physical object; determining that the user performed a predefined user gesture with respect to a location of the physical object that corresponds to the at least one manipulable portion, and wherein the digital camera obtains the predefined user gesture; displaying, with a computer display, the at least one manipulable portion in the augmented-reality view.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the other augmented reality portion comprises a digital image of a view of one or more connected exterior rooms of the building.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the digital image is obtained from a database of digital images comprising interior rooms of the building.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the exterior view comprises a hybrid view.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein a set of hybrid augmented elements complete the virtual exterior view.
18. The method of claim 16, wherein the hybrid view comprises a set of augmented reality elements that complete the item and/or connect to the item.
