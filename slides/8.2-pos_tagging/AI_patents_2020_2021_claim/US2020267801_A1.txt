METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MESSAGE PROCESSING IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to method and apparatus for message processing wireless communications. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a method performed by a wireless device in a wireless communication system comprises: receiving, by an adapt entity of the wireless device, an adapt protocol data unit (PDU) comprising a payload for an upper layer entity and specific information informing whether the payload is to be processed by the upper layer entity; determining whether to process the adapt PDU by the adapt entity based on the specific information; and transmitting, by the adapt entity, the payload to the upper layer entity based on a determination that the adapt PDU is to be processed by the upper layer entity.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method performed by a wireless device in a wireless communication system, the method comprising: receiving, by an adapt entity of the wireless device, an adapt protocol data unit (PDU) comprising a payload for an upper layer entity and specific information informing whether the payload is to be processed by the upper layer entity; determining whether to process the adapt PDU by the adapt entity based on the specific information; and transmitting, by the adapt entity, the payload to the upper layer entity based on a determination that the adapt PDU is to be processed by the upper layer entity.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the adapt PDU comprises at least one of an identifier (ID) of a transmitting node that has generated the payload or an identifier of a processing entity of the transmitting node.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: processing the payload differently based on whether the ID is an ID of a donor node or an ID of a neighbor node different from the donor node.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the payload is transmitted from the adapt entity to the upper layer entity while bypassing a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) entity of the wireless device.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein a header of the adapt PDU comprises at least one of: a field set to a value to inform that the adapt PDU is a control PDU; a type identifier set to a value to identify a type of control information in the adapt PDU, the type informing a protocol related to the control information; the specific information informing whether the payload is to be processed by the upper layer entity; a source address of a source node that has generated the payload; a destination address of a destination node at which the payload terminates; quality of service (QoS) filed to inform a QoS requirement of the adapt PDU; or a sequence number for in-order delivery.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the destination address comprises at least one of an internet protocol (IP) address of the destination node, a radio-network temporary identifier (RNTI) allocated to the destination node, or a dedicated identifier (ID) of a processing entity of the destination node, and wherein the processing entity is related to the type identifier.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: transmitting, by the adapt entity, the payload to an upper layer entity of the wireless device based on a determination by the adapt entity that the payload terminates at the adapt entity.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: transmitting, by the adapt entity, the payload to another entity in a distributed unit (DU) of the wireless device for a transmission of the payload to a neighbor node based on a determination by the adapt entity that the payload terminates at the DU.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the upper layer entity comprises a radio resource control (RRC) entity.
10. A wireless device in a wireless communication system comprising: a transceiver; a memory; and at least one processor operatively coupled to the transceiver and the memory, and configured to: control the transceiver to receive, by an adapt entity of the wireless device, an adapt protocol data unit (PDU) comprising a payload for an upper layer entity and specific information informing whether the payload is to be processed by the upper layer entity, determine whether to process the adapt PDU by the adapt entity based on the specific information, and transmit, by the adapt entity, the payload to the upper layer entity based on a determination that the adapt PDU is to be processed by the upper layer entity.
11. The wireless device of claim 10, wherein the adapt PDU comprises at least one of an identifier (ID) of a transmitting node that has generated the payload or an identifier of a processing entity of the transmitting node.
12. The wireless device of claim 11, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to process the payload differently based on whether the ID is an ID of a donor node or an ID of a neighbor node different from the donor node.
13. The wireless device of claim 10, wherein the payload is transmitted from the adapt entity to the upper layer entity while bypassing a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) entity of the wireless device.
14. The wireless device of claim 10, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to transmit, by the adapt entity, the payload to an upper layer entity of the wireless device based on a determination by the adapt entity that the payload terminates at the adapt entity.
15. The wireless device of claim 10, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to transmit, by the adapt entity, the payload to another entity in a distributed unit (DU) of the wireless device for a transmission of the payload to a neighbor node based on a determination by the adapt entity that the payload terminates at the DU.
16. The wireless device of claim 10, wherein the upper layer entity comprises a radio resource control (RRC) entity.
17. A processor for a wireless device in a wireless communication system, wherein the processor is configured to control the wireless device to perform operations comprising: receiving, by an adapt entity of the wireless device, an adapt protocol data unit (PDU) comprising a payload for an upper layer entity and specific information informing whether the payload is to be processed by the upper layer entity; determining whether to process the adapt PDU by the adapt entity based on the specific information; and transmitting, by the adapt entity, the payload to the upper layer entity based on a determination that the adapt PDU is to be processed by the upper layer entity.
