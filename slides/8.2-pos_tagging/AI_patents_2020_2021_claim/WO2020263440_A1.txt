DATA-DRIVEN CROSS FEATURE GENERATION
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for generating cross features using a data driven approach are provided. Multiple possible splits of a numerical feature are identified. For each split, the numerical feature is transformed into a second feature based on the split, a cross feature is generated based on the second feature and a third (e.g., categorial) feature that is different than the first feature and the second feature, a predictive power of the cross feature is estimated, and the predictive power is added to a set of estimated predictive powers. After each split is considered, a cross feature that is associated with the highest estimated predictive power in the set of estimated predictive powers is selected. That first cross feature corresponds to a particular split from the multiple possible splits. The numerical feature is split based on the particular split to generate a bucketized version of the numerical feature.

<claims>
1. A method comprising:
identifying a first plurality of possible splits of a first feature that is a numeric feature;
for each split of the first plurality of possible splits:
transforming the first feature into a second feature based on said each split; generating a cross feature based on the second feature and a third feature that is different than the first feature and the second feature;
estimating a predictive power of the cross feature;
adding the predictive power to a set of estimated predictive powers;
selecting a first cross feature that is associated with the highest estimated
predictive power in the set of estimated predictive powers, wherein the first cross feature corresponds to a first split in the first plurality of possible splits;
splitting the first feature based on the first split to generate a fourth feature that is different than the first feature;
wherein the method is performed by one or more computing devices.
2. The method of Claim 1, wherein the fourth feature comprises one more bucket than the first feature.
3. The method of Claim 1, further comprising:
determining a minimum resolution of the first feature;
determining a minimum value of the first feature;
determining a maximum value of the first feature;
wherein identifying the first plurality of possible splits is based on the minimum resolution, the minimum value, and the maximum value.
4. The method of Claim 1, wherein transforming the first feature into the second feature based on the said each split comprises:
identifying a particular bucket of the first feature that is to be split based on said each split;
generating a first bucket and a second bucket based on the particular bucket;
wherein a first boundary of the first bucket is the same as a first boundary of the particular bucket;
wherein a second boundary of the first bucket is based on said each split;
wherein a first boundary of the second bucket is based on said each split; wherein a second boundary of the second bucket is the same as a second boundary of the particular bucket.
5. The method of Claim 1, wherein estimating the predictive power of the cross
feature comprises calculating an entropy of a label and an entropy of the label given the cross feature.
6. The method of Claim 1, further comprising:
removing the first split from the first plurality of possible splits to create a second plurality of possible splits.
7. The method of Claim 1, further comprising:
for each split of a second plurality of possible splits of the fourth feature:
transforming the fourth feature into a fifth feature based on said each split; generating a second cross feature of the fifth feature and the third feature; estimating a second predictive power of the second cross feature;
adding the second predictive power to a second set of estimated predictive powers;
selecting a third cross feature that is associated with the highest estimated
predictive power in the second set of estimated predictive powers, wherein the third cross feature corresponds to a second split in the second plurality of possible splits;
splitting the fourth feature based on the second split to generate a sixth feature that is different than the first, third, and fourth features.
8. The method of Claim 7, further comprising:
generating a first estimate of predictive power of the first cross feature;
generating a second estimate of predictive power of the third cross feature;
determining whether a difference between the first estimate and the second
estimate is less than a threshold value;
using the first cross feature or the third cross feature as a feature when training a model in response to determining that the difference between the first estimate and the second estimate is less than the threshold value.
9. The method of Claim 7, further comprising:
incrementing a count, wherein the count has a particular value prior to selecting the first cross feature;
after selecting the first cross feature, determining whether the count equals a
threshold value; in response to determining that the count does not equal the threshold value, transforming the fourth feature into the fifth feature;
incrementing the count;
after selecting the third cross feature, determining whether the count equals the threshold value;
in response to determining that the count equals the threshold value, using the third cross feature as a feature when training a model.
10. The method of Claim 1, wherein the first feature is a time-based feature and the second feature is a categorical feature.
11. One or more storage media storing instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause performance of the method recited in any of Claims 1-10.
