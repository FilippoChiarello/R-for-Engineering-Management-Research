Method and device for detecting region of interest based on images
</title>

<abstract>
A method and device for detecting region of interest based on images is disclosed. The method includes creating, by a region detection device, at least one histogram associated with at least one storage area within an image captured for a predetermined location. The method further includes identifying, by the region detection device, a plurality of boundaries within the at least one storage area based on the at least one histogram. The method includes detecting, by the region detecting device, at least one region of interest based on the plurality of boundaries.

<claims>
1. A method for detecting regions of interest associated with at least one product from at least one image, the method comprising: identifying, by a region detection device, at least one storage area from at least one image based on a machine learning model, wherein the at least one image comprises the at least one product, and wherein identifying the at least one storage area comprises: adding a first boundary box around the at least one storage area in the at least one image; and extracting the at least one storage area from the at least one image based on the first boundary box; identifying, by the region detection device, outer edges of the at least one storage area extracted from the at least one image; creating, by the region detection device, at least one histogram for the at least one storage area lying within the outer edges; identifying, by the region detection device, a plurality of boundaries within the at least one storage area based on the at least one histogram, wherein identifying the plurality of boundaries comprises applying a line detection algorithm on the at least one histogram; and detecting, by the region detecting device, at least one region of interest based on the plurality of boundaries, wherein the at least one region of interest comprises a second boundary box that encompasses the at least one product.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one region of interest is detected based on intersection of the plurality of boundaries.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one storage area comprises at least one of fixtures, frames, shelves, racks, cabinets, or boxes.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one histogram comprises at least one of a vertical histogram, a diagonal histogram, or a horizontal histogram.
5. A region detection device for detecting regions of interest associated with at least one product from at least one image, the region detection device comprising: at least one cameras; a processor communicatively coupled to the at least one camera; and a memory communicatively coupled to the processor, wherein the memory stores processor instructions, which, on execution, cause the processor to: identify at least one storage area from the at least one image based on a machine learning model, wherein the at least one image comprises the at least one product, and wherein identifying the at least one storage area comprises: adding a first boundary box around the at least one storage area in the at least one image; and extracting the at least one storage area from the at least one image based on the first boundary box; identify outer edges of the at least one storage area extracted from the at least one image; create at least one histogram for the at least one storage area lying within the outer edges; identify a plurality of boundaries within the at least one storage area based on the at least one histogram, wherein identifying the plurality of boundaries comprises applying a line detection algorithm on the at least one histogram; and detect at least one region of interest based on the plurality of boundaries, wherein the at least one region of interest comprises a second boundary box that encompasses the at least one product.
6. The region detection device of claim 5, wherein the at least one region of interest is detected based on intersection of the plurality of boundaries.
7. The region detection device of claim 5, wherein the at least one storage area comprises at least one of fixtures, frames, shelves, racks, cabinets, or boxes.
8. The region detection device of claim 5, wherein the at least one histogram comprises at least one of a vertical histogram, a diagonal histogram, or a horizontal histogram.
9. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored thereon, a set of computer-executable instructions causing a computer comprising one or more processors to perform steps comprising: identifying at least one storage area from at least one image based on a machine learning model, wherein the at least one image comprises at least one product, and wherein identifying the at least one storage area comprises: adding a first boundary box around the at least one storage area in the at least one image; and extracting the at least one storage area from the at least one image based on the first boundary box; identifying outer edges of the at least one storage area extracted from the at least one image; creating at least one histogram for the at least one storage area lying within the outer edges; identifying a plurality of boundaries within the at least one storage area based on the at least one histogram, wherein identifying the plurality of boundaries comprises applying a line detection algorithm on the at least one histogram; and detecting at least one region of interest based on the plurality of boundaries, wherein the at least one region of interest comprises a second boundary box that encompasses the at least one product.
