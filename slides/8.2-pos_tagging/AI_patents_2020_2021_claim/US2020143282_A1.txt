<abstract>
A method for quantizing a machine learning model during an inference phase, including determining a normalization factor using a set of floating-point values and a damped value of a damped value sequence; and assigning a quantized value for each floating-point value of the set of floating-point values based on the damped value sequence and the normalization factor.
