<title>
Bypassing error correction code (ECC) processing based on software hint
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and apparatus relating to techniques for avoiding cache lookup for cold cache. In an example, an apparatus comprises logic, at least partially comprising hardware logic, to receive metadata from an application, wherein the meta data indicates one or more processing operations which can accommodate a predetermined level of bit errors in read operations from memory, determine, from the metadata, pixel data for which error correction code bypass is acceptable, and generate one or more error correction code bypass hints for subsequent cache access to the pixel data for which error correction code bypass is acceptable, and transmit the one or more error correction code bypass hints to a graphics processing pipeline. Other embodiments are also disclosed and claimed.

<claims>
1. An apparatus comprising: a graphics processor to: receive, in a graphics processing pipeline implemented on the graphics processor, a frame; initiate graphics processing operations on the frame; receive one or more error correction code bypass hints which identify pixel data in the frame for which bypass of error correction code processing is to be enabled; and bypass the error correction code processing in response to the one or more error correction code bypass hints when retrieving the pixel data from a cache memory.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the one or more graphics processing operations comprise at least one of a texturing operation or a coloring operation.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising: an error correction code block communicatively coupled to the cache memory to perform error correction code processing on the pixel data from the cache memory, the error correction code block comprising one or more fast Fourier transform circuits.
4. The apparatus of claim 3, further comprising: an and gate communicatively coupled to the cache memory to: receive the pixel data from the cache memory and the error correction code hint, and output the pixel data from the cache memory when the error correction code hint indicates that error correction code processing is to be enabled.
5. The apparatus of claim 4, further comprising: a multiplexer communicatively coupled to the cache memory and to the output of the error correction code block to, the multiplexer to: receive error the correction code bypass hint as a control signal.
6. The apparatus of claim 5, the multiplexer to: output one of the pixel data from cache memory or the output of the error correction code block in response to a value of the error correction code bypass hint.
7. An electronic device, comprising: a graphics processor to: receive, in a graphics processing pipeline implemented on the graphics processor, a frame; initiate graphics processing operations on the frame; receive one or more error correction code bypass hints which identify pixel data in the frame for which bypass of error correction code processing is to be enabled; and bypass the error correction code processing in response to the one or more error correction code bypass hints when retrieving the pixel data from a cache memory; and a computer-readable memory communicatively coupled to the graphics processor.
8. The electronic device of claim 7, wherein the one or more graphics processing operations comprise at least one of a texturing operation or a coloring operation.
9. The electronic device of claim 7, further comprising: an error correction code block communicatively coupled to the cache memory to perform error correction code processing on the pixel data from the cache memory, the error correction code block comprising one or more fast Fourier transform circuits.
10. The electronic device of claim 9, further comprising: an and gate communicatively coupled to the cache memory to: receive the pixel data from the cache memory and the error correction code hint, and output the pixel data from the cache memory when the error correction code hint indicates that error correction code processing is to be enabled.
11. The electronic device of claim 10, further comprising: a multiplexer communicatively coupled to the cache memory and to the output of the error correction code block to, the multiplexer to: receive error the correction code bypass hint as a control signal.
12. The electronic device of claim 11, the multiplexer to: output one of the pixel data from cache memory or the output of the error correction code block in response to a value of the error correction code bypass hint.
13. A method comprising: receiving, in a graphics processing pipeline implemented on the graphics processor, a frame; initiating graphics processing operations on the frame; receiving one or more error correction code bypass hints which identify pixel data in the frame for which bypass of error correction code processing is to be enabled; and bypassing the error correction code processing in response to the one or more error correction code bypass hints when retrieving the pixel data from a cache memory.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the one or more graphics processing operations comprise at least one of a texturing operation or a coloring operation.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein an error correction code block is communicatively coupled to the cache memory to perform error correction code processing on the pixel data from the cache memory, the error correction code block comprising one or more fast Fourier transform circuits.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein an and gate is communicatively coupled to the cache memory to: receive the pixel data from the cache memory and the error correction code hint, and output the pixel data from the cache memory when the error correction code hint indicates that error correction code processing is to be enabled.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein a multiplexer is communicatively coupled to the cache memory and to the output of the error correction code block to, the multiplexer to: receive error the correction code bypass hint as a control signal.
18. The method of claim 17, further comprising: outputting, from the multiplexer, one of the pixel data from cache memory or the output of the error correction code block in response to a value of the error correction code bypass hint.
