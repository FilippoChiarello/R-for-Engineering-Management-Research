MACHINE LEARNING IN RADIO ACCESS NETWORKS
</title>

<abstract>
According to an example aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method comprising, receiving, from a first data endpoint of a radio access network, a representation of a local model of the first data endpoint of the radio access network, determining multiple common models for endpoints of the radio access network, selecting, based on the representation of the local model of the first data endpoint, one of said multiple common models for the first data endpoint and transmitting the selected common model to the first data endpoint, any other data endpoint or any other external system which utilizes the selected common model.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: - receiving, from a first data endpoint of a radio access network, a representation of a local model of the first data endpoint of the radio access network; - determining multiple common models for endpoints of the radio access network; - selecting, based on the representation of the local model of the first data endpoint, one of said multiple common models for the first data endpoint; and - transmitting the selected common model to the first data endpoint, any other data endpoint or any other external system which utilises the selected common model.
2. A method according to claim 1, further comprising: - determining the selected common model based at least partially on the local model of the first data endpoint.
3. A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising: - determining a representation of a local model of a second data endpoint of the radio access network; - determining that the local model of the first data endpoint is similar compared to the local model of the second data endpoint; and - grouping the first and the second data endpoints to a group, wherein the group is associated with the selected common model.
4. A method according to claim 3, further comprising: - determining the selected common model by averaging parameters of the local model of the first data endpoint and parameters of the local model of the second data endpoint.
5. A method according to any of the preceding claims, further comprising: - determining a number of common models M; - determining representations of local models of N data endpoints; and - grouping said N data endpoints for said M common models so that each of said N data endpoints is associated with one of said M common models.
6. A method according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the representation of the local model of the first data endpoint comprises information about changed parameters compared to a previous local model of the first data endpoint, and the selected common model is determined based on the changed parameters.
7. A method, comprising: - receiving, from an aggregation unit, a common model for a first data endpoint of a radio access network; - selecting a local model of the first data endpoint of the radio access network or the common model; - adapting communication parameters based on the selected model; and - communicating over an air interface using the communication parameters.
8. A method according to claim 7, further comprising: - determining that the local model is to be used instead of the common model; and - using, based on the determination, the local model for communicating over the air interface.
9. A method according to claim 7 or claim 8, wherein said selecting the local model or the common model further comprises: - comparing the local model to the common model; and - determining, based on the comparison, whether to use the local model or the common model.
10. A method according to claim 9, further comprising: - determining, based on the comparison, that the local model is more accurate than the common model; and - using, based on the determination, the local model for communicating over the air interface.
11. An apparatus comprising: - means for receiving, from a first data endpoint of a radio access network, a representation of a local model of the first data endpoint of the radio access network; - means for determining multiple common models for endpoints of the radio access network; - means for selecting, based on the representation of the local model of the first data endpoint, one of said multiple common models for the first data endpoint; and - means for transmitting the selected common model to the first data endpoint, any other data endpoint or any other external system which utilises the selected common model.
12. An apparatus according to claim 11, further comprising means for performing a method according to any of claims 2 - 6.
13. An apparatus comprising: - means for receiving, from an aggregation unit, a common model for a first data endpoint of a radio access network; - means for selecting a local model of the first data endpoint of the radio access network or the common model; - means for adapting communication parameters based on the selected model; and - means for communicating over an air interface using the communication parameters.
14. An apparatus according to claim 13, further comprising means for performing a method according to any of claims 8 - 10.
15. A computer program configured to perform a method according to any of claims 1 - 6 or 7 - 10.
