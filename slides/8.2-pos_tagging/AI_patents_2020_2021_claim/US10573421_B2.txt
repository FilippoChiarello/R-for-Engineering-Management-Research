Plant operation system and plant operation method
</title>

<abstract>
An atomic power plant operation system for assisting the operation of an atomic power generation plant is provided with: an operation monitoring system which monitors and controls the operation of the atomic power generation plant; an abnormality indication monitoring system which, on the basis of an operation history of the atomic power generation plant, monitors an indication of abnormality in the atomic power generation plant; an abnormality diagnosis system which, on the basis of a result of abnormality indication that has been detected, makes an abnormality diagnosis for the atomic power generation plant; and a maintenance system for performing maintenance and management of the atomic power generation plant, wherein the systems are communicably connected, and the abnormality diagnosis system provides the maintenance system with the result of the abnormality diagnosis of the atomic power generation plant.

<claims>
1. A plant operation system configured to support operation of a plant, the system comprising: an operation monitoring system configured to acquire and monitor a plurality of measurement parameters which are output from a plurality of measuring instruments provided in the plant as plant operation data to control the operation of the plant based on the plant operation data; an operation history database configured to store the plant operation data; an abnormality indication monitoring system configured to monitor an indication of abnormality of the plant, based on history of the plant operation data stored in the operation history database; an abnormality diagnosis system configured to perform a diagnosis of abnormality of the plant, based on a result of the abnormality indication which is detected by the abnormality indication monitoring system to output a diagnosis result; and a maintenance system with a maintenance database which stores therein the diagnosis results from the abnormality diagnosis system as maintenance data for the plant configured to acquire the maintenance data from the maintenance data base to provide the acquired maintenance data to a maintenance worker of the plant and to store a maintenance inspection result obtained by inspection work by the maintenance worker in the maintenance database, wherein the operation monitoring system, the abnormality indication monitoring system, and the abnormality diagnosis system are connected via unit bus to one another so as to be able to communicate from the operation monitoring system to the abnormality indication monitoring system and the abnormality diagnosis system, the abnormality diagnosis system and the maintenance system are connected via unit bus to each other so as to be able to communicate with each other, and the abnormality diagnosis system is configured to compare an abnormality sign pattern generated by the current plant operation data with a plurality of abnormality model patterns of the past plant operation data stored in the operation history database, and when the abnormality sign pattern corresponds to one of the plurality of abnormality model patterns, configured to specify an occurrence probability corresponding to a cause of the specified abnormality as the diagnosis result and output the diagnosis result to the maintenance system, and when the abnormality sign pattern corresponds to some of the plurality of abnormality model patterns, configured to specify, using a Bayesian network as a statistical model, each of the occurrence probabilities corresponding to each of causes of the specified abnormalities as the diagnosis result and output the diagnosis result to the maintenance system.
2. The plant operation system according to claim 1, wherein the maintenance system has a maintenance terminal configured to acquire the result of the abnormality diagnosis from the abnormality diagnosis system, and a maintenance mobile terminal configured to perform wireless communication with the maintenance terminal, and the maintenance terminal is configured to provides the result of the abnormality diagnosis toward the maintenance mobile terminal.
3. The plant operation system according to claim 2, wherein the maintenance terminal and the maintenance mobile terminal are provided in a building in which the plant is installed.
4. A plant operation method for a plant operation system configured to support operation of a plant the plant operation system comprising; an operation monitoring system configured to control the operation of the plant; an operation history database configured to store the plant operation data; an abnormality indication monitoring system configured to monitor an indication of abnormality of the plant; an abnormality diagnosis system configured to perform a diagnosis of abnormality of the plant; and a maintenance system configured to store information for maintenance of the plant in a maintenance database and to provide the information to a maintenance worker of the plant; wherein the operation monitoring system, the abnormality indication monitoring system, and the abnormality diagnosis system are connected via unit bus to one another so as to be able to communicate from the operation monitoring system to the abnormality indication monitoring system and the abnormality diagnosis system and the abnormality diagnosis system and the maintenance system are connected via unit bus to each other so as to be able to communicate with each other; the method comprising; acquiring and monitoring, in the operation monitoring system, a plurality of measurement parameters which are output from a plurality of measuring instruments provided in the plant as plant operation data to control the operation of the plant based on the plant operation data; storing step, in the operation history database, the plant operation data; monitoring, in the abnormality indication monitoring system, an indication of abnormality of the plant, based on history of the plant operation data stored in the operation history database; performing, in the abnormality diagnosis system, a diagnosis of abnormality of the plant, based on a result of the abnormality indication which is detected by the abnormality indication monitoring system to output a diagnosis result; and acquiring, in the maintenance system, maintenance data from a maintenance database which stores therein the diagnosis results from the abnormality diagnosis system as the maintenance data for the plant, providing the acquired maintenance data to a maintenance worker of the plant and storing a maintenance inspection result obtained by inspection work by the maintenance worker in the maintenance database, characterized in that the method comprising; in performing the diagnosis of abnormality of the plant, comparing an abnormality sign pattern generated by the current plant operation data with a plurality of abnormality model patterns of the past plant operation data stored in the operation history database, and when the abnormality sign pattern corresponds to one of the plurality of abnormality model patterns, specifying an occurrence probability corresponding to a cause of the specified abnormality as the diagnosis result and outputting the diagnosis result to the maintenance system; and when the abnormality sign pattern corresponds to some of the plurality of abnormality model patterns, specifying, using a Bayesian network as a statistical model, each of the occurrence probabilities corresponding to each of causes of the specified abnormalities as the diagnosis result and outputting the diagnosis result to the maintenance system.
