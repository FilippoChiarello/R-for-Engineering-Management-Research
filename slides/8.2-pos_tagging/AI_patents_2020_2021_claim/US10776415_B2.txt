System and method for visualizing and recommending media content based on sequential context
</title>

<abstract>
A method of visualizing recommended pieces of media content is provided. The method includes identifying at least one piece of media content associated with a received content feature associated with a viewed piece of media content, selecting at least one additional piece of media content linked to the viewed piece of media content by a sequential relationship, generating a two-dimensional visualization based on a content similarity between the identified at least one piece of media content, the viewed piece of media content, and the selected at least one additional piece of media content and the sequential relationship; and displaying the generated two-dimensional visualization.
