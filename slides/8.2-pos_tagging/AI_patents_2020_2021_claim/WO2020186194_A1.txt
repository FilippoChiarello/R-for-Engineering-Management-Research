AUGMENTED REALITY ASSISTED SURGICAL TOOL ALIGNMENT
</title>

<abstract>
Computer-assisted surgical systems and methods for assisting with tool alignment using one or more mixed reality displays are disclosed. The system may provide for obtaining an existing surgical plan that may include specific patient information and data about the surgical procedure. The system may receive from a tracking system, locational information of a patient bone and determine, based on the surgical plan and the locational information, a preferred location and angle for use of a surgical device. Once determined, the system may display on a mixed reality display one or more visual indicators associated with the preferred location and the preferred angle.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A computer-assisted surgical alignment method comprising:
obtaining, using a processor, a surgical plan;
receiving, from a tracking system, locational information of one or more patient bones;
receiving, from a tracking system, locational information of one or more patient bones;
determining, based on the surgical plan and the locational information, a preferred location and a preferred angle for one or more known surgical tools relative to the one or more patient bones;
capturing, with an image capture device, optical data associated with a feature of the one or more known surgical tools;
identifying, by analyzing the optical data, an offset value of the one or more known surgical tools relative to the preferred location and the preferred angle; and
displaying, on a mixed reality display, one or more visual indicators associated with the offset value.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more visual indicators comprise a ghost image of the one or more known surgical tools.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more visual indicators comprise one or more target shapes configured to visually represent the preferred location and the preferred angle.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the one or more target shapes are one or more of: a circle, a triangle, a square, a rectangle, a pentagon, a hexagon, an oval, a sphere, a cone, a cylinder, a cube, a cuboid, a tetrahedron, and an ellipsoid.
5. The system of claim 3, wherein at least one of the one or more target shapes changes shape based on the preferred location and the preferred angle.
6. The system of claim 3, wherein the at least one of one or more target shapes changes color based on the preferred location and the preferred angle.
7 The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving, from the tracking system, locational information of one or more surgical tools.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein determining a preferred location and a preferred angle is further based on the location of the one or more surgical tools.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising calculating relational data between the locational information of the one or more surgical tools and the locational information of the one or more patient bones.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the one or more visual indicators comprise one or more numerical values associated with the relational data.
11. The method of claim 9, further comprising calculating, based on the relational data, an abduction value and an anteversion value of a patient bone.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the one or more visual indicators comprise the abduction value and the anteversion values.
13. The method of claim 1, further comprising, emitting, using one or more speakers, an audio cue based on the relational data.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more visual indicators comprise the offset value.
15. A computer-assisted surgical alignment system comprising:
a processor;
a mixed reality display;
an image capture device; a tracking system; and
a non-transitory, processor-readable storage medium that stores instructions executable by the processor to:
obtain a surgical plan,
receive, from the tracking system, locational information of one or more patient bones,
determine, based on the surgical plan and the locational information, a preferred location and a preferred angle for one or more known surgical tools relative to the one or more patient bones,
capture, with the image capture device, optical data associated with a feature of the one or more known surgical tools,
identify, by analyzing the optical data, an offset value of the one or more known surgical tools relative to the preferred location and the preferred angle, and display, on the mixed reality display, one or more visual indicators associated with the preferred location and the preferred angle.
