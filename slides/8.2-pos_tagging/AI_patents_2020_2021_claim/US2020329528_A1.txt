MULTIPLE ACTIVE NETWORK WIRELESS DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A wireless device capable of using multiple SIM cards to simultaneously communicate with multiple cellular networks is presented. The wireless device is a dual-SIM dual-data active device that is capable of receiving and transmitting data packets over multiple cellular networks simultaneously or at substantially the same time. The wireless device may include a second set of antennas and internal hardware, including a second model and processor enabling the wireless device to communicate with at least two cellular networks. The wireless device may select a cellular network to perform a task, such as complete a call or download a video based on a difference in signal strength between the two or more cellular networks supported by the wireless device.

1. 1-20. (canceled)
21. A wireless device configured to simultaneously maintain communication channels over a plurality of data networks, the wireless device comprising: a first radio frequency subsystem comprising a first front-end module configured to process signals of a first receive band associated with a first data network and signals of a second receive band of a second data network; a second radio frequency subsystem comprising a second front-end module configured to process the signals of the first receive band associated with the first data network and the signals of the second received band associated with the second data network; a hardware processor in communication with the first radio frequency subsystem and the second radio frequency subsystem, wherein the hardware processor is configured to control whether the first radio frequency subsystem communicates with the first data network associated with a first subscriber identity module of the wireless device or communicates with the second data network associated with a second subscriber identity module of the wireless device during a particular time period; a first modem connected to a first port of the hardware processor, the first modem configured to transmit packets using the first radio frequency subsystem via a first antenna to one of the first data network or the second data network; a second modem configured to transmit packets using the second radio frequency subsystem via a second antenna to one of the first data network or the second data network; and a communication hub connected to a second port of the hardware processor, the communication hub configured to connect the second modem to the hardware processor.
22. The wireless device of claim 21, wherein the second modem is integrated with the second radio frequency subsystem.
23. The wireless device of claim 22, wherein the first modem is separate from and in communication with the first radio frequency subsystem.
24. The wireless device of claim 21, wherein the communication hub is inserted between an external port of the wireless device and a port of the hardware processor that connects to the external port of the wireless device.
25. The wireless device of claim 24, wherein the external port comprises one or more of a charge port or a data transfer port.
26. The wireless device of claim 24, wherein the external port comprises a universal serial bus port.
27. The wireless device of claim 21, wherein the second modem comprises an embedded processor that communicates with the hardware processor.
28. The wireless device of claim 27, wherein the embedded processor is a control host for the second modem, and wherein the embedded processor is at least partially controlled by the hardware processor.
29. The wireless device of claim 21, further comprising a tuner configured to determine whether a receive signal is of the first receive band or the second receive band.
30. The wireless device of claim 21, wherein the hardware processor selects one of the first data network or the second data network to transmit a packet based on a comparison of a signal strength of the first data network and a signal strength of the second data network.
31. The wireless device of claim 21, wherein the first antenna comprises a primary antenna configured to transmit and receive signals of the first receive band and signals of the second receive band.
32. The wireless device of claim 21, further comprising a diversity antenna configured to receive signals of the first receive band or the second receive band.
33. The wireless device of claim 32, wherein the hardware processor is further configured to determine a signal strength of a connection to one of the first data network or the second data network based on a receive signal received by the diversity antenna.
34. The wireless device of claim 32, wherein the hardware processor is further configured to process data packets received at the diversity antenna from the first data network and to transmit data packets over the first data network via the first antenna.
35. The wireless device of claim 21, wherein the first subscriber identity module is in communication with the hardware processor and the second subscriber identity module is in communication with the second radio frequency subsystem.
36. The wireless device of claim 21, further comprising a third subscriber identity module associated with a third data network.
37. The wireless device of claim 36, wherein the first subscriber identity module and the third subscriber identify module are in communication with the hardware processor and the second subscriber identity module is in communication with the second radio frequency subsystem.
38. The wireless device of claim 21, wherein the first antenna comprises a first primary antenna in communication with the first radio frequency subsystem and the second antenna comprises a second primary antenna in communication with the second radio frequency subsystem.
39. The wireless device of claim 38, further comprising a first diversity antenna in communication with the first radio frequency subsystem and a second diversity antenna in communication with the second radio frequency subsystem, wherein the hardware processor is further configured to determine a signal strength of a connection to one of the first data network or the second data network based on a first receive signal received by the first diversity antenna or a second receive signal received by the second diversity antenna.
40. The wireless device of claim 21, wherein the first data network is implemented using a first communication technology and is associated with a first service provider, and the second data network is implemented using a second communication technology and is associated with a second service provider.
