METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR SELECTING A REGION OF INTEREST IN AN IMAGE
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method and system for selecting one or more regions of interest (ROIs) in an image. The method comprises: identifying one or more objects of interest that have been segmented from the image; identifying predefined landmarks of the objects; determining reference morphometrics pertaining to the objects by performing morphometrics on the objects by reference to the landmarks; selecting one or more ROIs from the objects according to the reference morphometrics, comprises identifying the location of the ROIs relative to the reference morphometrics; and outputting the selected one or more ROIs.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for selecting one or more regions of interest (ROIs) in an image, the method comprising: identifying one or more objects of interest that have been segmented from the image; identifying predefined landmarks of the objects; determining reference morphometrics pertaining to the objects by performing morphometrics on the objects by reference to the landmarks; selecting one or more ROIs from the objects according to the reference morphometrics, comprising identifying the location of the ROIs relative to the reference morphometrics; and outputting the selected one or more ROIs.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein determining the reference morphometrics comprises (a) measuring basic morphometrics on the objects by reference to the detected landmarks and determining the reference morphometrics based on the measured basic morphometrics, or (b) measuring basic morphometrics on the objects by reference to the detected landmarks and determining the reference morphometrics based on the measured basic morphometrics and employing one or more trained deep learning reference morphometric models.
3. A method as claimed in either claim 1 or 2, wherein the selecting of the one or more ROIs from the objects according to the reference morphometrics further comprises determining the shape and size of the ROIs.
4. A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, further comprising segmenting the objects from the image, wherein segmenting the objects (a) comprises generating masks of the respective segmented objects; and/or (b) employs one or more trained machine learning segmentation models.
5. A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, further comprising preparing the image for segmentation by pre-processing the image, such as by applying a Gaussian blur function to the image to reduce noise, and/or applying histogram equalization to enhance contrast of the image.
6. A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, further comprising normalizing the objects, by coordinate transformation or otherwise, before performing the morphometrics on the objects.
7. A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, further comprising determining density of one or more of the selected ROIs using attenuation of a referent material.
8. A system for selecting one or more regions of interest (ROIs) in an image, the system comprising: an object and landmark identifier configured to identify one or more objects of interest that have been segmented from the image, and to identify predefined landmarks of the objects; a morphometer configured to determine reference morphometrics pertaining to the objects by performing morphometrics on the objects by reference to the landmarks; a region selector configured to select one or more ROIs from the objects according to the reference morphometrics, comprising identifying the location of the ROIs and determining the shape and size of the ROIs relative to the reference morphometrics; and a results output configured to output the selected ROIs.
9. Asystem as claimed in claim 8, wherein the morphometer is configured to determine the reference morphometrics (a) by measuring basic morphometrics on the objects by reference to the detected landmarks and to determine the reference morphometrics based on the measured basic morphometrics; or (b) by measuring basic morphometrics on the objects by reference to the detected landmarks and to determine the reference morphometrics based on the measured basic morphometrics and by employing one or more trained deep learning reference morphometric models.
10. A system as claimed in either claim 8 or 9, wherein the region selector is further configured to determine the shape and size of the ROIs relative to the reference morphometrics.
11. A system as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 10, further comprising a segmenter configured to segment the objects from the image, wherein the segmenter is configured (a) to generate masks of the respective segmented objects; and/or (b) to employ one or more trained machine learning segmentation models to segment the objects.
12. A system as claimed in either claim 8 to 11, further comprising: an image pre-processor configured to prepare the image for segmentation by pre-processing the image; a normalizer configured to normalize the objects, by coordinate transformation or otherwise, before morphometrics are performed on the objects; and/or a density determiner configured to determine density of one or more of the selected ROIs using attenuation of a referent material.
13. A region of interest (ROI) selected according to the method of any one of claims 1 to 7.
14. A computer program, comprising program code configured to, when executed by one or more processors, implement the method for selecting a region of interest (ROI) in an image of any one of claims 1 to 7.
15. A computer-readable medium, comprising the computer program of claim 14.
