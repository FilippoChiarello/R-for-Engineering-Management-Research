<title>
FULLY AUTOMATED SEM SAMPLING SYSTEM FOR E-BEAM IMAGE ENHANCEMENT
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein is a method of automatically obtaining training images to train a machine learning model that improves image quality. The method may comprise analyzing a plurality of patterns of data relating to a layout of a product to identify a plurality of training locations on a sample of the product to use in relation to training the machine learning model. The method may comprise obtaining a first image having a first quality for each of the plurality of training locations, and obtaining a second image having a second quality for each of the plurality of training locations, the second quality being higher than the first quality. The method may comprise using the first image and the second image to train the machine learning model.

<claims>
1. An apparatus for automatically obtaining training images to train a machine learning model that improves image quality, the apparatus comprising:
a memory; and
at least one processor coupled to the memory and configured to:
analyze a plurality of patterns of data relating to a layout of a product to identify a plurality of training locations to use in relation to training the machine learning model;
obtain a first image having a first quality for each of the plurality of training locations; obtain a second image having a second quality for each of the plurality of training locations, the second quality being higher than the first quality; and
use the first image and the second image to train the machine learning model.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the data is in a database.
3. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the database is any one of a graphic database system (GDS), an Open Artwork System Interchange Standard, or a Caltech Intermediate Form.
4. The apparatus of claim 3, where the GDS includes GDS formatted data or GDSII formatted data.
5. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the at least one processor is further configured to obtain more than one first image having a first quality for each of the plurality of training locations.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to obtain more than one second image having a second quality for each of the plurality of training locations.
7. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to classify the plurality of patterns into a plurality of subsets of patterns.
8. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to extract a feature from the plurality of patterns.
9. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the extracted feature includes a shape, a size, a density, or a neighborhood layout.
10. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to classify the plurality of patterns into a plurality of subsets of patterns based on the extracted feature.
11. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein each subset of the plurality of subsets of patterns is associated with information relating to a location, a type, a shape, a size, a density or a neighborhood layout.
12. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to identify the plurality of training locations based on a field of view, a local alignment point, or an auto-focus point.
13. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is further
configured to
determine a first scanning path including a first scan for obtaining the first image, the first scanning path based on an overall scan area for the plurality of training locations.
14. The apparatus of claim 13, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to
determine a second scanning path including a second scan for obtaining the second image, the second scanning path based on an overall scan area for the plurality of training locations.
15. A nontransitory computer readable medium storing a set of instructions that is executable by a controller of a device to cause the device to perform a method comprising:
analyzing a plurality of patterns of data relating to a layout of a product to identify a plurality of training locations to use in relation to training the machine learning model;
obtaining a first image having a first quality for each of the plurality of training locations; obtaining a second image having a second quality for each of the plurality of training locations, the second quality being higher than the first quality; and
using the first image and the second image to train the machine learning model.
