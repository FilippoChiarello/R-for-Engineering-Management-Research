METHOD OF OPERATING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MACHINES TO IMPROVE PREDICTIVE MODEL TRAINING AND PERFORMANCE
</title>

<abstract>
A method of improving the training and performance of predictive models. A first method of operating an artificial intelligence machine produces predictive model language documents describing improved predictive models that generate better business decisions from raw data record inputs. A second method of operating an artificial intelligence machine including processors for predictive model algorithms produces and outputs better business decisions from raw data record inputs. Both methods enrich the raw data records their processors are fed by deleting data fields with data values that have little benefit in decision making, and that derive and add new data fields from information sources then available that do benefit in the decision making of the artificial intelligence machine through improved accuracies of prediction.
