<title>
SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR A WEARABLE DEVICE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY NON-DESTRUCTIVE ACOUSTIC STIMULATION
</title>

<abstract>
In some aspects, a device wearable by a person includes a sensor configured to detect a signal from the brain of the person and a transducer configured to apply to the brain an ultrasound signal. The ultrasound signal has a low power density and is substantially non-destructive with respect to tissue when applied to the brain.

CLAIMS
1. A device wearable by a person, comprising:
a sensor configured to detect a signal from the brain of the person; and a transducer configured to apply to the brain an ultrasound signal,
wherein the ultrasound signal has a low power density and is substantially non-destructive with respect to tissue when applied to the brain.
2. The device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the sensor and the transducer are disposed on the head of the person in a non-invasive manner.
3. The device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the sensor includes an
electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor, and wherein the signal includes an EEG signal.
4. The device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the transducer includes an ultrasound transducer.
5. The device as claimed in claim 4, wherein the ultrasound signal has a frequency between 100 kHz and 1 MHz, a spatial resolution between 0.001 cm3 and 0.1 cmJ, and/or the low power density between 1 and 100 watts/cm as measured by spatial-peak pulse-average intensity.
6. The device as claimed in claim 4, wherein the ultrasound signal suppresses a symptom of a neurological disorder.
7. The device as claimed in claim 6, wherein the neurological disorder includes one or more of stroke, Parkinson's disease, migraine tremors, frontotemporal dementia, traumatic brain injury, depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, brain damage, neurodegeneration, central nervous system (CNS) disease, encephalopathy, Huntington's disease, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and concussion.
8. The device as claimed in claim 6, wherein the symptom includes a seizure.
9. The device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the signal comprises an electrical signal, a mechanical signal, an optical signal, and/or an infrared signal.
10. A method for operating a device wearable by a person, the device including a sensor configured to detect a signal from the brain of the person and a transducer configured to apply to the brain an ultrasound signal, comprising:
applying to the brain the ultrasound signal, wherein the ultrasound signal has a low power density and is substantially non-destructive with respect to tissue when applied to the brain.
11. A method comprising:
applying to the brain of a person, by a device worn by or attached to the person, an ultrasound signal.
12. An apparatus comprising:
a device worn by or attached to a person including a sensor configured to detect a signal from the brain of the person and a transducer configured to apply to the brain an ultrasound signal,
wherein the ultrasound signal has a low power density and is substantially non-destructive with respect to tissue when applied to the brain.
