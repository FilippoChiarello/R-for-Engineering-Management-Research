METHODS AND APPARATUSES FOR COLLECTION OF ULTRASOUND DATA ALONG DIFFERENT ELEVATIONAL STEERING ANGLES
</title>

<abstract>
Ultrasound devices and methods are described for collecting ultrasound data. An ultrasound device may include an ultrasound transducer array. The ultrasound device may collect ultrasound data along multiple elevational steering angles with respective apertures of different sizes. The ultrasound data may be used to perform a measurement or generate a visualization.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. An ultrasound device, the ultrasound device comprising:
an ultrasound transducer array;
and wherein:
the ultrasound device is configured to:
collect first ultrasound data along a first elevational steering angle with a first aperture of the ultrasound transducer array; and
collect second ultrasound data along a second elevational steering angle with a second aperture of the ultrasound transducer array; and
the first aperture is a different size than the second aperture.
2. The ultrasound device of claim 1, wherein the first aperture comprises a first number of elevational rows of the ultrasound transducer array, the second aperture comprises a second number of elevational rows of the ultrasound transducer array, and the first number is different from the second number.
3. The ultrasound device of claim 2, wherein the first number and the second number are between 8-64.
4. The ultrasound device of claim 2, wherein the first elevational steering angle is farther from normal to an elevational dimension of the ultrasound transducer array than the second elevational steering angle, and the first number is larger than the second number.
5. The ultrasound device of claim 1, wherein the first elevational steering angle is farther from normal to an elevational dimension of the ultrasound transducer array than the second elevational steering angle, and the first aperture is larger than the second aperture.
6. The ultrasound device of claim 1, wherein the first and second elevational steering angles are among a plurality of elevational steering angles used in an ultrasound imaging sweep, and wherein the plurality of elevational steering angles includes between 30-50 steering angles.
7. The ultrasound device of claim 1, wherein the first and second elevational steering angles are among a plurality of elevational steering angles that are varied with respect to an axis that is parallel to a skin line of a subject being imaged.
8. The ultrasound device of claim 1, wherein the ultrasound device further comprises ultrasound circuitry, and the ultrasound device is configured, when collecting the first and second ultrasound data, to use the ultrasound circuitry to apply delays to ultrasound waves prior to transmission and/or subsequent to reception.
9. The ultrasound device of claim 8, wherein the ultrasound circuitry is integrated on a same die as the ultrasound transducer array.
10. The ultrasound device of claim 8, wherein the ultrasound circuitry includes at least one of a waveform generator, a pulser, an analog processing block, an analog-to-digital converter, and a digital processing block.
11. The ultrasound device of claim 8, wherein the ultrasound device is portable and the ultrasound transducer array and the ultrasound circuitry are contained within the portable ultrasound device.
12. The ultrasound device of claim 8, wherein the ultrasound device is a handheld probe and the ultrasound transducer array and the ultrasound circuitry are contained within the handheld probe.
13. The ultrasound device of claim 8, wherein the ultrasound device is a wearable patch and the ultrasound transducer array and the ultrasound circuitry are contained within the wearable patch.
14. The ultrasound device of claim 1, wherein the ultrasound device is in operative communication with a processing device, and the ultrasound device is further configured to transmit the first and second ultrasound data and/or data generated based on the first and second ultrasound data to the processing device.
15. The ultrasound device of claim 14, wherein the processing device is a smartphone, tablet, or laptop.
16. The ultrasound device of claim 1, wherein the first ultrasound data and the second ultrasound data are collected as part of single scan.
17. The ultrasound device of claim 1, wherein the first ultrasound data and the second ultrasound data are collected as part of a single ultrasound imaging sweep.
18. The ultrasound device of claim 17, wherein the ultrasound imaging sweep comprises an elevational sweep.
19. The ultrasound device of claim 1, wherein the ultrasound device is further configured to digitally beamform the first and second ultrasound data along an elevational dimension of the ultrasound transducer array.
20. The ultrasound device of claim 1, wherein the ultrasound device is configured, when collecting the first and second ultrasound data, to collect ultrasound data from a bladder.
