</title>

<abstract>
Method for plantation treatment of a plantation field, the method comprising taking an image of a plantation of a plantation field; recognizing items on the taken image by running a first image recognition analysis of a first complexity on the taken image based on a stored parametrization of a machine learning algorithm; identifying an unsatisfying image analysis result; determining ambient data corresponding to the taken image; recognizing items on the taken image by running a second image recognition analysis of a second complexity on the image based on the ambient data on an external device, wherein the second complexity is higher than the first complexity; determining an improved parametrization based on the second image recognition analysis for the machine learning algorithm for improving the first image recognition analysis; and controlling a treatment arrangement of a treatment device based on the first image recognition analysis.
