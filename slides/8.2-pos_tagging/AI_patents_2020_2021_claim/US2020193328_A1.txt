MACHINE LEARNING ASSISTED IMAGE PREDICTION
</title>

<abstract>
A device implementing a system for providing predicted RGB images includes at least one processor configured to obtain an infrared image of a subject, and to obtain a reference RGB image of the subject. The at least one processor is further configured to provide the infrared image and the reference RGB image to a machine learning model, the machine learning model having been trained to output predicted RGB images of subjects based on infrared images and reference RGB images of the subjects. The at least one processor is further configured to provide a predicted RGB image of the subject based on output by the machine learning model.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: capturing, by a device, an infrared image of a subject; obtaining, by the device, a reference RGB image of the subject; providing the infrared image and the reference RGB image as inputs to a machine learning model, the machine learning model having been trained to output predicted RGB images of subjects based on infrared images and corresponding RGB images of the subjects; and providing a predicted RGB image of the subject based on output by the machine learning model.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the reference RGB image of the subject is captured by an RGB image sensor concurrent with capturing the infrared image.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the reference RGB image of the subject is an RGB image of the subject captured prior to capturing the infrared image.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the predicted RGB image corresponds to a color representation of the infrared image.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: selecting, by the device, the machine learning model from plural machine learning models based on an ambient lux level.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the selected machine learning model has been trained based on concurrently captured infrared and RGB images of corresponding subjects.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein a lux level of an environment in which the RGB images were captured is below a predefined lux level.
8. The method of claim 5, wherein the selected machine learning model has been trained based on infrared images and corresponding RGB images captured prior to the infrared images.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein a lux level of an environment in which the corresponding RGB images were captured is above a predefined lux level.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model has been further trained based on target RGB images which were captured concurrently with capturing corresponding IR images in an environment having a lux level above a predefined lux level.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model is configured to receive estimated facial characteristics corresponding to at least one of facial segmentation or skin segmentation, and wherein the output of the machine learning model is based at least partially on the estimated facial characteristics.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising: performing background subtraction with respect to the subject prior to providing the infrared image and the reference RGB image to the machine learning model.
13. The method of claim 1, further comprising: performing focal length adjustment on at least one of the infrared image or the reference RGB image prior to providing the infrared image and the reference RGB image to the machine learning model.
14. The method of claim 1, further comprising: performing resolution adjustment on at least one of the infrared image or the reference RGB image prior to providing the infrared image and the reference RGB image to the machine learning model.
15. A device, comprising: an infrared image sensor; at least one processor; and a memory including instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to: capture, by the infrared image sensor, an infrared image of a subject; obtain a reference RGB image of the subject; provide the infrared image and the reference RGB image to a machine learning model, the machine learning model having been trained to output predicted RGB images based on infrared images and corresponding RGB images of subjects; and provide a predicted RGB image of the subject based on an output of the machine learning model.
16. The device of claim 15, further comprising: an RGB image sensor configured to capture the reference RGB image of the subject concurrently with the infrared image being captured by the infrared image sensor.
17. The device of claim 15, wherein the reference RGB image of the subject is captured prior to the infrared image of the subject.
18. The device of claim 15, wherein the predicted RGB image corresponds to a color representation of the infrared image.
19. The device of claim 15, wherein the instructions further cause the at least one processor to: select the machine learning model from plural machine learning models based on an ambient lux level, wherein the selected machine learning model has been trained based on concurrently captured infrared and RGB images of corresponding subjects, or wherein the selected machine learning model has been trained based on infrared images and corresponding RGB images captured prior to the infrared images.
20. A computer program product comprising code stored in a tangible computer-readable storage medium, the code comprising: code to obtain an infrared image of a subject; code to obtain a reference color image of the subject; code to select a machine learning model from plural machine learning models based on an ambient lux level; code to provide the infrared image and the reference color image to the selected machine learning model, the selected machine learning model having been trained to output predicted color images based on infrared images and reference color images of subjects; and code to provide a predicted color image of the subject based on an output of the selected machine learning model.
