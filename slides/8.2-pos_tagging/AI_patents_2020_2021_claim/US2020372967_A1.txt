SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING COUNTERFEIT MEMORY
</title>

<abstract>
Due to design variations, process variations, manufacturing variations, and other factors, memory of a certain type manufactured by one manufacturer often exhibits a unique pattern of performance characteristics relative to the patterns of the same type of performance characteristics exhibited by memory from other manufacturers. A system for identifying counterfeit memory is trained to learn the different patterns of performance characteristics for different manufacturers of memory. Thereafter, the system may analyze the performance of a given memory device to determine whether the memory device has been manufactured by a particular manufacturer. Thus, the system is capable of determining whether the memory device is counterfeit (e.g., has been manufactured by an unexpected manufacturer).

<claims>
Now, therefore, the following is claimed:
1. A system, comprising: a memory device; and a memory analyzer coupled to the memory device and having at least one processor programmed with memory analysis logic that has been trained to learn correlations between a plurality of performance signatures from memory devices manufactured by a manufacturer, wherein the memory analysis logic when executed by the at least one processor is configured to: receive at least one performance signature from the memory device, the at least one performance signature based on a performance of the memory device in performing a memory operation on memory cells of the memory device, wherein the at least one performance signature is uniquely generated by the memory device based on at least manufacturing variations of the memory device; identify an origin of the memory device based on the at least one performance signature and the learned correlations; and provide an output indicative of the origin.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the at least one performance signature comprises a set of power-up default values stored in the memory cells after power up of the memory device.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the memory analysis logic, when executed by the at least one processor, is configured to cause the memory device to induce errors in at least one data value stored in or read from the memory cells, and wherein the at least one performance signature is indicative of the errors.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the memory analysis logic, when executed by the at least one processor, is configured to cause the memory device to induce latency errors in at least one data value stored in the memory cells by causing the memory device to (1) initiate a write operation for writing the at least one data value to the memory cells and (2) initiate a read operation for reading the memory cells a sufficiently short amount of time after initiating the write operation so that the latency errors are induced in data read by the read operation, and wherein the at least one performance signature is indicative of the latency errors.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the output indicates whether the memory device is determined to be counterfeit.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the memory device comprises dynamic random access memory (DRAM) having the memory cells, and wherein the memory analysis logic, when executed by the at least one processor, is configured to cause the memory device to induce refresh errors in at least one data value stored in the memory cells by controlling a rate that the memory device refreshes the memory cells, and wherein the at least one performance signature is indicative of the refresh errors.
7. A method, comprising: receiving, at a memory analyzer, at least one performance signature from a memory device, the at least one performance signature based on a performance of the memory device in performing a memory operation on memory cells of the memory device, wherein the at least one performance signature is uniquely generated by the memory device based on at least manufacturing variations of the memory device, and wherein the memory analyzer has at least one processor programmed with memory analysis logic that has been trained to learn correlations between a plurality of performance signatures from memory devices manufactured by a manufacturer; analyzing, by the memory analyzer, that at least one performance signature based on the learned correlations; identifying, by the memory analyzer, an origin of the memory device based on the analyzing; and providing an output indicative of the origin.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the at least one performance signature comprises a set of power-up default values stored in the memory cells after power up of the memory device.
9. The method of claim 7, further comprising inducing errors in at least one data value stored in or read from the memory cells, wherein the at least one performance signature is indicative of the errors.
10. The method of claim 7, further comprising inducing latency errors in at least one data value stored in the memory cells by causing the memory device to (1) initiate a write operation for writing the at least one data value to the memory cells and (2) initiate a read operation for reading the memory cells a sufficiently short amount of time after initiating the write operation so that the latency errors are induced in data read by the read operation, wherein the at least one performance signature is indicative of the latency errors.
11. The method of claim 7, further comprising determining, with the memory analyzer, whether the memory device is counterfeit based on the origin, and wherein the output indicates whether the memory device is determined to be counterfeit.
12. The method of claim 7, wherein the memory device comprises dynamic random access memory (DRAM) having the memory cells, wherein the method further comprises inducing refresh errors in at least one data value stored in the memory cells by controlling a rate that the memory device refreshes the memory cells, and wherein the at least one performance signature is indicative of the refresh errors.
