Apparatus for diagnosing and treating dizziness
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus for treating dizziness comprises an input unit configured to input a type of dizziness suffered by a patient, a storage unit configured to store different treatment methods respectively corresponding to different types of dizziness, an operation unit configured to search for a treatment method corresponding to the diagnosed type of dizziness among the treatment methods stored in the storage unit based on the diagnosed type of dizziness, and an output unit configured to output the searched treatment method for the inputted type of dizziness to the patient.

<claims>
1. An apparatus for diagnosing and treating dizziness, comprising: a nystagmus detection unit executed by a processor configured to detect nystagmus from an eyeball of a patient suffering from dizziness; a motion sensing unit configured to sense a motion of the patient; a diagnosis unit executed by the processor configured to diagnose a type of dizziness suffered by the patient based on the detected nystagmus and the sensed motion as one of vestibular neuritis and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; a storage unit configured to store different treatment methods respectively corresponding to different types of dizziness; an operation unit executed by the processor configured to search for a treatment method corresponding to the diagnosed type of dizziness among the treatment methods stored in the storage unit based on the diagnosed type of dizziness; and an output unit configured to output the searched treatment method for the diagnosed type of dizziness to the patient, wherein the nystagmus detection unit includes at least one electrode configured to measure a potential difference between a cornea and a retina of the eyeball, and wherein the diagnosis unit obtains a location where an otolith is located among semicircular ducts of the patient based on the detected nystagmus and the sensed motion of the patient when the type of dizziness is the benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the nystagmus detection unit includes an imaging unit configured to take an image of a motion of the eyeball.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the output unit is configured to output a first motion to the patient, wherein the first motion indicates an action for the patient to take through which the type of dizziness suffered by the patient and the location where the otolith is located among the semicircular ducts of the patient are to be diagnosed.
4. The apparatus of claim 3, further comprising: an evaluation unit configured to determine whether the motion of the patient sensed by the motion sensing unit is matched with the first motion or not.
5. The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the output unit is configured to output a determination result of the evaluation unit.
6. The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the evaluation unit is configured to repeat determination until the motion of the patient sensed by the motion sensing unit is matched with the first motion, and the output unit is configured to output a result of the determination repeated by the evaluation unit.
7. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising: an evaluation unit configured to determine whether the motion of the patient sensed by the motion sensing unit is matched with a second motion suggested by the searched treatment method or not, wherein the second motion indicates an action for the patient to take through which the dizziness treatment, alleviation or rehabilitation is to be achieved.
8. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein the output unit is configured to output an evaluation result of the evaluation unit.
9. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein the evaluation unit is configured to repeat evaluation until the motion of the patient sensed by the motion sensing unit is matched with the second motion, and the output unit is configured to output a result of the evaluation repeated by the evaluation unit.
10. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the nystagmus detection unit is configured to re-detect nystagmus from the patient after the searched treatment method is performed to the patient.
11. The apparatus of claim 10, further comprising: an evaluation unit configured to evaluate a treatment result of the searched treatment method performed to the patient based on the re-detected nystagmus, wherein the storage unit is configured to store at least one of the re-detected nystagmus and the treatment result of the searched treatment method.
12. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the output unit is configured to output a first motion for nystagmus detection to the patient before the nystagmus is detected by the nystagmus detection unit, the first motion indicating an action for the patient to take through which the type of dizziness suffered by the patient and the location where the otolith is located among the semicircular ducts of the patient are to be diagnosed, the apparatus further comprising: an evaluation unit executed by the processor configured to determine whether the motion of the patient sensed by the motion sensing unit is matched with the first motion or not, wherein in case the type of dizziness is the benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and the motion of the patient is matched with the first motion, the diagnosis unit determines that the otolith exists in one of the semicircular ducts corresponding to the first motion when the diagnosis unit receives one input that the dizziness of the patient has been alleviated, and wherein the diagnosis unit determines that the otolith exists in other semicircular ducts than said one of the semicircular ducts corresponding to the first motion when the diagnosis unit receives another input that the dizziness of the patient maintains without an improvement, and wherein the output unit outputs a second motion different from the first motion to the patient when the diagnosis unit determines that the otolith exists in other semicircular ducts than said one of the semicircular ducts corresponding to the first motion, the second motion indicating an action for the patient to take through which the dizziness treatment, alleviation or rehabilitation is to be achieved.
