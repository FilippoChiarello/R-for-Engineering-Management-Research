<title>
Methods And Systems For Delaying Message Notifications
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems are provided for delayed message notification associated with a content item. The system can receive a notification from a first user and intended for a second user, and can comprise a message, a content identifier, and a timestamp indicating a relative time within a content item associated with the content identifier. The system can transmit, to a device associated with the second user, a portion of the notification. In one implementation, the system can receive an indication that the second user's device is presenting the content item, and cause the message to be presented to the second.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving, by a first device associated with a first user, from a computing device, a content identifier associated with a content item, a position of an event within the content item, and a message generated by a second user of a second device; determining, based on the content identifier, that the first device is causing output of the content item; and causing, based on determining that the first device is causing output of the content item and the content item is at the position of the event during the output of the content item, output of the message.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein determining that the first device is causing output of the content item comprises comparing an identifier for the content item being output to the content identifier.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein causing output of the message comprises displaying the message on the first device.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein causing output of the message comprises sending the message to a third device associated with the first device for output on the third device.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving, by the first device, a link to the content item.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising causing, by the first device, based on an activation of the link, output of the content item.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining, based on a current position of the content item being output, that the first device has output a portion of the content item associated with the event.
8. A method comprising: determining, by a first device associated with a first user, a content identifier associated with a content item; receiving a message generated by the first user; generating a communication comprising the content identifier, a position of an event within the content item, and the message; sending the communication for output on a second device associated with a second user, wherein the communication is configured to cause output of the message at the second device during output of the event in the content item at the second device.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the content identifier is determined based on the content item currently being output at the first device.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the message is concatenated with another portion of the communication.
11. The method of claim 8, further comprising receiving data indicating a user account associated with a second user, wherein the user account indicates one or more devices associated with the second user.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the data comprises one or more of an internet protocol (IP) address, a media access control (MAC) address, a telephone number, a social networking account name, an email address, and a handle.
13. The method of claim 8, further comprising determining that the first device has completed an output of the content item, wherein the communication is sent based upon the first device completing the output of the content item.
14. A method comprising: receiving, by a computing device, from a first device associated with a first user, a content identifier, a position of an event within a content item associated with the content identifier, and a message generated by the first user; and sending, to a second device associated with a second user, the message, wherein the message is configured to be output, at the second device, when the second device is causing output of the content item and the content item is at the position of the event during the output of the content item.
15. The method of claim 14, further comprising generating a communication comprising the content identifier, the position of the event within the content item, and the message, wherein sending the message comprises sending the communication.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein generating the communication comprises concatenating the message by the first user with at least one of the content identifier and the position of the event within the content item.
17. The method of claim 14, further comprising: receiving, from the first device, data indicating a user account associated with the second user; and determining, based on the user account, the second device associated with a second user.
18. The method of claim 14, further comprising: receiving, from the first device, data indicating an identification of the second user, wherein the message is sent to the second device based on the identification of the second user.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the data indicating the identification of the second user comprises a first address associated with the second device and a second address associated with a third device associated with the second device.
20. The method of claim 14, further comprising generating a communication comprising concatenating the message by the first user with at least one of the content identifier and the position of the event within the content item.
21. The method of claim 14, further comprising sending to the second device, the content identifier, wherein the second device causes, based on the content identifier, output of an indication of the content item.
22. The method of claim 14, wherein the content identifier, the position of the event within the content item associated with the content identifier, and the message are received upon the first device completing output of the content item.
