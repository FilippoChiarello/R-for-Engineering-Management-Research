PREDICTING THE PROBABILITY OF A PRODUCT PURCHASE
</title>

<abstract>
The probability that an entity will purchase a product is predicted. This prediction involves receiving input data in the form of entries each of which represents an interest event. Through a series of iterations, a final matrix is generated from the input data entries by assigning an entity-product identifier pair associated with each interest event to a different location in the matrix, along with a time identifier indicative of how far back in time the interest event occurred from a prescribed date of interest. A supervised machine learning technique is employed to create a final prediction model for each product of interest using the final matrix as input. For each product, its prediction model is applied to the input data to estimate the probability that an entity will purchase the product within a future time period.
