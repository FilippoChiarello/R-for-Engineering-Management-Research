<title>
Proactive environment-based chat information system
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is the technology for computer-based "Daily Brief" service, which includes methods and corresponding systems for proactively providing push notifications for users of chat information systems. The push notifications are dynamically generated and presented to the user based on identification of one or more triggering events, which may include predetermined time/date, current geographical location, activity of peers and friends in social media associated with the user, scheduled events, appointments, meetings, emails, instant messages, and many more. The described technology improves the interaction interface between the user and chat information system.

<claims>
1. A method for proactively delivering push notifications in a chat information system (CIS), the method implemented by one or more processors and comprising: generating, based on configuration input provided by a user, one or more triggering events for providing a set of dynamic push notifications to the user via the CIS, wherein the one or more triggering events include: identification of one or more words in a voice command, and a specific time; monitoring for occurrence of any one of the triggering events; responsive to determining, based on the monitoring, an occurrence of any one of the triggering events: providing, to a user device, a current set of the dynamic push notifications, including at least a first current push notification that includes first audio content and a second current push notification that includes second audio content; wherein providing the current set of the dynamic push notifications causes the user device to render, in sequence, the first audio content of the first current push notification and the second audio content of the second current push notification.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more triggering events further include presence of one or more peripheral electronic devices within a predetermined distance of the user device.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more triggering events further include presence of the user device within one or more wireless networks.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the first audio content includes schedule information associated with the user, and the second audio content includes one or more personal communications associated with the user, wherein the personal communications are associated with one or more of the following: an email, a text message, an instant message, a blog post, a social networking site message, or a voice message.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the first audio content includes one or more weather information items and where the second audio content includes traffic conditions.
6. A method for proactively delivering push notifications in a chat information system (CIS), the method implemented by one or more processors and comprising: generating, based on configuration input provided by a user, at least one triggering event for providing a set of dynamic push notifications to the user via the CIS, wherein the at least one triggering event includes: presence of one or more peripheral electronic devices within a predetermined distance of the user device; responsive to recognizing presence of the one or more peripheral electronic devices within the predetermined distance of the user device: providing, to a user device, a current set of the dynamic push notifications, including at least a first current push notification that includes first audio content and a second current push notification that includes second audio content; wherein providing the current set of the dynamic push notifications causes the user device to render, in sequence, the first audio content of the first current push notification and the second audio content of the second current push notification.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the at least one triggering event further includes a specific time.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the first audio content includes schedule information associated with the user, and the second audio content includes one or more personal communications associated with the user, wherein the personal communications are associated with one or more of the following: an email, a text message, an instant message, a blog post, a social networking site message, or a voice message.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the first audio content includes one or more weather information items and where the second audio content includes traffic conditions.
10. A chat information system (CIS), the CIS comprising: one or more processors; and memory storing instructions, that when executed by one or more of the processors, cause one or more of the processors to: generate, based on configuration input provided by a user, one or more triggering events for providing a set of dynamic push notifications to the user via the CIS, wherein the one or more triggering events include: identification of one or more words in a voice command, and a specific time; monitor for occurrence of any one of the triggering events; responsive to determining, based on the monitoring, an occurrence of any one of the triggering events: cause a user device that is associated with the user and the CIS to render, in sequence: first audio content of at least a first current push notification of the push notifications, and second audio content of a second current push notification of the dynamic push notifications.
11. The CIS of claim 10, wherein the one or more triggering events further include presence of one or more peripheral electronic devices within a predetermined distance of the user device.
12. The CIS of claim 10, wherein the one or more triggering events further include presence of the user device within one or more wireless networks.
13. The CIS of claim 10, wherein the first audio content includes schedule information associated with the user, and the second audio content includes one or more personal communications associated with the user, wherein the personal communications are associated with one or more of the following: an email, a text message, an instant message, a blog post, a social networking site message, or a voice message.
14. The CIS of claim 10, wherein the first audio content includes one or more weather information items and where the second audio content includes traffic conditions.
