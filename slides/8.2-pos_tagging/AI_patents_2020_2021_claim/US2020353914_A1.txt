IN-VEHICLE PROCESSING DEVICE AND MOVEMENT SUPPORT SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
An in-vehicle processing device comprises a sensor input unit which acquires sensor information as an output of a sensor which acquires information around a vehicle, a movement information acquisition unit which acquires vehicle movement information as information related to a movement of the vehicle, a log recording unit which records information based on the vehicle movement information and the sensor information in a storage unit, a map generation unit which creates an environmental map including a drivable area where the vehicle can travel based on determination of static objects that do not move and mobile objects that can move by using information based on the vehicle movement information and the sensor information recorded in the storage unit, and a route calculation unit which calculates a travel route of the vehicle by using the environmental map, wherein the environmental map includes information of a parking position as a position of parking the vehicle.

<claims>
1. An in-vehicle processing device, comprising: a sensor input unit which acquires sensor information as an output of a sensor which acquires information around a vehicle; a movement information acquisition unit which acquires vehicle movement information as information related to a movement of the vehicle; a log recording unit which records information based on the vehicle movement information and the sensor information in a storage unit; a map generation unit which creates an environmental map including a drivable area where the vehicle can travel based on determination of static objects that do not move and mobile objects that can move by using information based on the vehicle movement information and the sensor information recorded in the storage unit; and a route calculation unit which calculates a travel route of the vehicle by using the environmental map, wherein the environmental map includes information of a parking position as a position of parking the vehicle.
2. The in-vehicle processing device according to claim 1, wherein recording by the log recording unit is ended when parking of the vehicle is completed, and wherein the map generation unit and the route calculation unit start their operation after parking of the vehicle is completed.
3. The in-vehicle processing device according to claim 1, wherein information based on the vehicle movement information is information using coordinates in a parking lot coordinate system based on the parking position.
4. The in-vehicle processing device according to claim 1, wherein information based on the vehicle movement information is the vehicle movement information including steering information of the vehicle and speed information of the vehicle.
5. The in-vehicle processing device according to claim 1, wherein the route calculation unit calculates a center in a width direction of the drivable area as the travel route.
6. The in-vehicle processing device according to claim 1, wherein recording by the log recording unit is started from departure of the vehicle from the parking position.
7. The in-vehicle processing device according to claim 1, further comprising: a calculation result recording unit which records the environmental map and the travel route in the storage unit; and an automatic processing unit which controls the vehicle by using the environmental map and the travel route.
8. The in-vehicle processing device according to claim 7, wherein the automatic processing unit causes the vehicle to move to the parking position by using the environmental map and the travel route.
9. The in-vehicle processing device according to claim 7, wherein the automatic processing unit causes the vehicle parked at the parking position to move along the travel route by using the environmental map and the travel route.
10. A movement support system including an in-vehicle processing device mounted on a vehicle, and a server that is not mounted on the vehicle, wherein the in-vehicle processing device comprises: a sensor input unit which acquires sensor information as an output of a sensor which acquires information around the vehicle; a movement information acquisition unit which acquires vehicle movement information as information related to a movement of the vehicle; and an in-vehicle communication unit which sends information based on the vehicle movement information and the sensor information to the server, wherein the server comprises: a server communication unit which receives information based on the vehicle movement information and the sensor information from the in-vehicle processing device; a map generation unit which creates an environmental map including a drivable area where the vehicle can travel based on determination of static objects that do not move and mobile objects that can move by using information based on the vehicle movement information and the sensor information recorded in the storage unit; and a route calculation unit which calculates a travel route of the vehicle by using the environmental map, wherein the server communication unit sends the environmental map and the travel route to the in-vehicle processing device, and wherein the in-vehicle processing device further comprises: an automatic processing unit which controls the vehicle by using the environmental map and the travel route.
