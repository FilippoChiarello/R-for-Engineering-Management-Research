RESONATING PROBE WITH OPTIONAL SENSOR, EMITTER, AND/OR INJECTION CAPABILITY
</title>

<abstract>
A microsurgical probe employs an optional probe support structure; an optical fiber for providing a feed path for an emission wavelength; a chemical feed path for delivering a chemical; a resonator motor; and a probe accessory tool. A microsurgical system additionally employs a sensor and an artificial intelligence (AI) system to assess conditions based on data provided by the sensor. The system can be employed to remove tumor tissue that is interwoven with healthy tissue. This system can also be employed to fertilize old, inflexible ova.

<claims>
1. A microsurgical probe, comprising: an optional probe support structure; an optical fiber for providing a feed path for an emission wavelength; a chemical feed path for delivering a chemical; a resonator motor; and a probe accessory tool.
2. The microsurgical probe of claim 1, wherein the chemical comprises one or more of a tumor-shrinking chemical, a lubricating chemical, a temperature-adjusting chemical, a membrane-softening agent, or a de-wormer.
3. The microsurgical probe of claim 1, wherein the chemical is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier.
4. The microsurgical probe of claim 1, wherein the resonator motor comprises an adaptive resonator or an adaptively unbalanced resonator.
5. The microsurgical probe of claim 1, wherein the probe accessory tool comprises a grasping tool, a hollow needle, a semicircular hollow needle, or a sperm coaxing actuator.
6. The microsurgical probe of claim 1, wherein the probe accessory tool is operable to be flash-temperature adjusted, is operable to be flash cooled, is operable to be flash heated, is operable to cauterize bleeding.
7. The microsurgical probe of claim 1, wherein the emission wavelength comprises light, UV light, visible light, infrared light, sound, audible sound, ultrasound, or a radio wave.
8. The microsurgical probe of claim 1, wherein the sensor comprises an image sensor or a sound sensor.
9. The microsurgical probe of claim 1, wherein the microsurgical probe comprises a flash chill tip.
10. The microsurgical probe of claim 1, wherein the lubricant is configured to attach to a colder surface of adjacent bodies.
11. The microsurgical probe of claim 1, wherein the lubricant is configured to be distributed in a thin coat.
