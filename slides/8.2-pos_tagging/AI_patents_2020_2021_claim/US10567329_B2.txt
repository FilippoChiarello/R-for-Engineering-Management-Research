<title>
Methods and apparatus for inserting content into conversations in on-line and digital environments
</title>

<abstract>
Content is inserted into conversations hosted on a takeoff site using creatives that provide lures and links to other material that users engaged in the conversation might find helpful and relevant. Such insertions are made in a contextually meaningful fashion through the use of a matching and decision process that determines best candidate creatives and an appropriate time and place for their insertion into the conversation.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: monitoring, by a processor, one or more input messages provided on a first electronic page, by an end user device; identifying, by the processor, a trigger based on the monitored one or more input messages; in response to identifying the trigger, accessing, by the processor, a plurality of candidate messages, each of the plurality of candidate messages including a prompt for taking an action; accessing, by the processor, information on a plurality of target electronic pages; calculating, by the processor, a score as a function of the one or more input messages, each of the plurality of candidate messages, and the information on each of the plurality of target electronic pages; based on the calculated score, identifying, by the processor, a particular candidate message from the plurality of candidate messages, and a particular target electronic page from the plurality of target electronic pages; providing, by the processor, the particular candidate message and a link to the particular target electronic page, for display on the first electronic page, wherein the link to the particular target electronic page is displayed inserted into the candidate message; monitoring, by the processor, user actuation of the link inserted into the displayed candidate message; and providing, by the processor, the particular target electronic page for display by the end user device in response to detecting the user actuation of the link.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the particular candidate message is inserted into a conversation including the one or more input messages.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein a topic of the one or more input messages matches a topic of content provided on the particular target electronic page.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the trigger is a particular utterance in the one or more input messages, and content of the particular target electronic page is correlated to the particular utterance.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the first electronic page and the target electronic page are each at least one of a web page, blog, social network site, or chat window.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the link is a hyperlink to the particular target electronic page.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the particular candidate message includes a slot for inserting the link.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the prompt for taking action includes a prompt to select the link inserted into the displayed candidate message.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the score is based on a learned clickthrough response associated with each of the plurality of candidate messages.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the score is based on sentiment associated with each of the plurality of candidate messages.
11. A system comprising: a processor; and a memory, wherein the memory stores instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to: monitor one or more input messages provided on a first electronic page, by an end user device; identify a trigger based on the monitored one or more input messages; in response to identifying the trigger, access a plurality of candidate messages, each of the plurality of candidate messages including a prompt for taking an action; access information on a plurality of target electronic pages; calculate a score as a function of the one or more input messages, each of the plurality of candidate messages, and the information on each of the plurality of target electronic pages; based on the calculated score, identify a particular candidate message from the plurality of candidate messages, and a particular target electronic page from the plurality of target electronic pages; provide the particular candidate message and a link to the particular target electronic page, for display on the first electronic page, wherein the link to the particular target electronic page is displayed inserted into the candidate message; monitor user actuation of the link inserted into the displayed candidate message; and provide the particular target electronic page for display by the end user device in response to detecting the user actuation of the link.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the particular candidate message is configured to be inserted into a conversation including the one or more input messages.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein a topic of the one or more input messages matches a topic of content provided on the particular target electronic page.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein the trigger is a particular utterance in the one or more input messages, and content of the particular target electronic page is correlated to the particular utterance.
15. The system of claim 11, wherein the first electronic page and the target electronic page are each at least one of a web page, blog, social network site, or chat window.
16. The system of claim 11, wherein the link is a hyperlink to the particular target electronic page.
17. The system of claim 11, wherein the particular candidate message includes a slot for inserting the link.
18. The system of claim 11, wherein the prompt for taking action includes a prompt to select the link inserted into the displayed candidate message.
19. The system of claim 11, wherein the score is based on a learned clickthrough response associated with each of the plurality of candidate messages.
20. The system of claim 11, wherein the score is based on sentiment associated with each of the plurality of candidate messages.
