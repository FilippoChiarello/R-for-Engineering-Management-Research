Image diagnosis learning device, image diagnosis device, image diagnosis method, and recording medium for storing program
</title>

<abstract>
An image diagnosis learning device includes: CNN configuration storage storing a network configuration of a convolutional neural network (CNN); parameter storage storing parameters of a learning subject in the CNN; inappropriate region detection unit that detects, an inappropriate region, in an image for learning in which the diagnosis subject is photographed; and inappropriate region invalidation unit invalidates a unit corresponding to the inappropriate region, among units of an input layer in the network configuration of the CNN to which the image for learning has been input. The image diagnosis learning device further includes loss value calculation unit performs calculation of the CNN by using the parameters in a state where the unit of the input layer, which corresponds to the inappropriate region, has been invalidated, and calculates a loss value; and parameter updating unit updates the parameters in the parameter storage.
