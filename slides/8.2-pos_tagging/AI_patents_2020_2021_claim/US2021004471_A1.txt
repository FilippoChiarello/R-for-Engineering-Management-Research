DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR DATA TRANSFER RISK IDENTIFICATION AND RELATED METHODS
</title>

<abstract>
In particular embodiments, a Data Transfer Risk Identification System may be configured to analyze one or more data systems (e.g., data assets), identify data transfers between/among those systems, apply data transfer rules to each data transfer record, perform a data transfer assessment on each data transfer record based on the data transfer rules to be applied to each data transfer record, and calculate a risk score for the data transfer based at least in part on the one or more data transfer risks associated with the data transfer record.
