<title>
Discovering terms using statistical corpus analysis
</title>

<abstract>
Software that extracts contextually relevant terms from a text sample (or corpus) by performing the following steps: (i) identifying a first term from a corpus, based, at least in part, on a set of initial contextual characteristic(s), where each initial contextual characteristic of the set of initial contextual characteristic(s) relates to the contextual use of at least one category related term of a set of category related term(s) in the corpus; (ii) adding the first term to the set of category related term(s), thereby creating a revised set of category related term(s) and a set of first term contextual characteristic(s), where each first term contextual characteristic of the set of first term contextual characteristic(s) relates to the contextual use of the first term in the corpus; and (iii) identifying a second term from the corpus, based, at least in part, on the set of first term contextual characteristic(s).
