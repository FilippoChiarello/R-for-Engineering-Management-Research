METHOD OF DETECTING MALFUNCTION IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING
</title>

<abstract>
A method of detecting malfunction in an additive powder-bed-fusion manufacturing process is provided. The method comprises, a), monitoring the additive manufacturing process and recording an acoustic incident (i), when said incident (i) is outside of a given tolerance range, wherein the incident is indicative for the malfunction. The method further comprises, b), classifying the incident (i), and, c), defining of a measure (m) to counteract the malfunction. Furthermore, a corresponding method of additive manufacturing, a corresponding apparatus as well as an additive manufacturing device are provided.

Patent claims
1. Method of detecting malfunction in an additive powder-bedfusion manufacturing process comprising:
- a) monitoring the additive manufacturing process and re
cording an acoustic incident (i), when said incident (i) is outside of a given tolerance range, wherein the inci dent is indicative for the malfunction, wherein the in cident (i) is caused by a collision of a recoater (30) of an additive manufacturing device (100) with a further structure, such as an already established part of the component (10) to be additively manufactured,
- b) classifying the incident (i), and
- c) defining of a measure (m) to counteract the malfunction, wherein the method further comprises an artificial in telligence, such as an artificial neural network (ANN) , which is applied in the monitoring, the classifying and/or the defining of the measure.
2. Method according to claim 1, wherein the method is comput er-implemented and comprises characterising the malfunction, in that the incident is classified amongst several nuances (Nl, N2 ) .
3. Method according to one of the previous claims, wherein a measure (m2) to counteract the malfunction is to delay the exposure of a subsequent irradiation vector (v) with an ener gy beam (21) by a defined period (t) based on the classifica tion of the incident (i) .
4. Method according to one of the previous claims, wherein a measure (m3) to counteract the malfunction is to change a speed of a recoater (30) in the additive manufacturing pro cess based on the classification of the incident (i) .
5. Method according to one of the previous claims, wherein a measure (m4) to counteract the malfunction is to vary the energy put in the respective powder layer (L) by an energy beam (21) based on the classification of the incident (i) .
6. Method according to one of the previous claims, wherein a measure (m) to counteract the malfunction is to select a re coating direction of a recoater (30) in the additive manufac turing process based on the classification of the incident
(i) .
7. Method according to claim 6, wherein the recoating direc tion is chosen at least partly parallel to an overhang direc tion (D) of a previously manufactured structure of the compo nent (10) to be manufactured.
8. Method according to one of the previous claims, wherein the monitoring is carried out continuously during the addi tive manufacturing process.
9. Method according to one of the previous claims, comprising considering a camera record of a manufacturing plane, such as an optical image of a built-in camera, in an additive manu facturing device for the classifying and/or the defining of the measure (m) .
10. Method of additive manufacturing (d) a component (10) by powder-bed-fusion comprising the method of detection malfunc tion according to one of the previous claims, wherein the method of detecting uses an artificial neural network (ANN) which is trained during the manufacturing process.
11. Method according to claim 10, wherein a CAMor irradia tion parameter set for the manufacture of a subsequent compo nent by additive powder-bed-fusion is adapted, such as an ir radiation strategy varied, based on the trained neural net work.
12. Apparatus (50) for additive manufacturing comprising a microphone (51) and a data processing unit (CPP) , wherein the apparatus (50) is configured to conduct the method of detect ing of one of the previous claims.
13. Additive manufacturing device (100) comprising the apparatus of claim 12.
