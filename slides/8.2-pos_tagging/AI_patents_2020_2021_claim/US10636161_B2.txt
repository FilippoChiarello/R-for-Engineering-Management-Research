<title>
Image recognition system
</title>

<abstract>
An image recognition system includes an external information detection unit detecting a distance to a target to be recognized included in an image, a reduced image size determination unit deriving a reduced size of the image based on the distance to the target to be recognized, an image reduction unit reducing the image based on the reduced size of the image, and an image recognition unit including a plurality of recognition process units corresponding to sizes of the images to be recognized and executing the recognition process of the target to be recognized included in the reduced image by means of the recognition process unit corresponding to a size of the image. Instead of the distance to the target to be recognized, a size and a shape of the image, or a clip position of the image from an entire image, may be used.
