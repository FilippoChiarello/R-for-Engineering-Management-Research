<title>
Methods and apparatuses for performing artificial intelligence encoding and artificial intelligence decoding on image
</title>

<abstract>
Provided is an artificial intelligence (AI) decoding apparatus includes: a memory storing one or more instructions; and a processor configured to execute the one or more instructions stored in the memory, the processor is configured to: obtain AI data related to AI down-scaling an original image to a first image; obtain image data corresponding to an encoding result on the first image; obtain a second image corresponding to the first image by performing a decoding on the image data; obtain deep neural network (DNN) setting information among a plurality of DNN setting information from the AI data; and obtain, by an up-scaling DNN, a third image by performing the AI up-scaling on the second image, the up-scaling DNN being configured with the obtained DNN setting information, wherein the plurality of DNN setting information comprises a parameter used in the up-scaling DNN, the parameter being obtained through joint training of the up-scaling DNN and a down-scaling DNN, and wherein the down-scaling DNN is used to obtain the first image from the original image.

<claims>
1. A server for providing an image by using an artificial intelligence (AI), the server comprising: a memory storing one or more instructions; and one or more processors configured to execute the one or more instructions stored in the memory to: select neural network (NN) setting information from a plurality of NN setting information that is pre-stored in the server; obtain, by a down-scaling NN, a first image by performing AI down-scaling on an original image, the down-scaling NN being set with the selected NN setting information; encode the first image to obtain image data; and provide an electronic device with the image data and AI data related to the AI down-scaling, the AI data comprising information related to the first image and being used to select NN setting information from a plurality of NN setting information that is pre-stored in the electronic device, wherein the plurality of NN setting information that is pre-stored in the server comprise a parameter for being used in the down-scaling NN, the parameter being obtained through joint training of the down-scaling NN and a up-scaling NN that is used to perform an AI up-scaling of a second image corresponding to a decoding result on the image data.
2. The server of claim 1, wherein the one or more processors selects the NN setting information from the plurality of NN setting information based on a compression ratio input from a user.
3. The server of claim 1, wherein the one or more processors selects the NN setting information from the plurality of NN setting information based on compression history information stored in the server.
4. The server of claim 1, wherein the one or more processors selects the NN setting information from the plurality of NN setting information based on at least one of a resolution of the original image or a type of the original image.
5. The server of claim 1, wherein the AI data comprises an identifier indicating the NN setting information from among the plurality of NN setting information that is pre-stored in the electronic device.
6. A method for providing an image by a server configured to use an artificial intelligence (AI), the method comprising: selecting neural network (NN) setting information from a plurality of NN setting information that is pre-stored in the server; obtaining, by a down-scaling NN, a first image by performing AI down-scaling on an original image, the down-scaling NN being set with the selected NN setting information; encoding the first image to obtain image data; and providing an electronic device with the image data and AI data related to the AI down-scaling, the AI data comprising information related to the first image and being used to select NN setting information from a plurality of NN setting information that is pre-stored in the electronic device, wherein the plurality of NN setting information that is pre-stored in the server comprise a parameter for being used in the down-scaling NN, the parameter being obtained through joint training of the down-scaling NN and a up-scaling NN that is used to perform an AI up-scaling of a second image corresponding to a decoding result on the image data.
7. A system comprising: a server for providing an image by using a down-scaling DNN, the down-scaling DNN being configured to be trained based on: structural loss information corresponding to a comparison of a first training image output from the down-scaling DNN and a reduced training image that is obtained from an original training image, complexity loss information corresponding to a spatial complexity of the first training image, and quality loss information corresponding to a comparison of the original training image and a third training image output from an up-scaling DNN; and an electronic device for displaying the image by using the up-scaling DNN, the up-scaling DNN being configured to be trained based on the quality loss information, wherein the server obtains, by the down-scaling NN, a first image by performing AI down-scaling on an original image, encodes the first image to obtain image data and provides the electronic device with the image data, and wherein the electronic device obtain a second image by decoding the image data, obtains, by the up-scaling NN, a third image by performing AI up-scaling on the obtained second image, and provides, on the display of the electronic device, the obtained third image.
