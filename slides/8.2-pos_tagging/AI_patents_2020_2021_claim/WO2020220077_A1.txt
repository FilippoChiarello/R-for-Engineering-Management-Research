<title>
A COMPUTER-ENABLED METHOD, SYSTEM AND COMPUTER PROGRAM FOR PROVIDING AN INTUITIVE USER INTERFACE ARRANGED TO CREATE A DYNAMIC FLOOR PLAN UTILISABLE BY AN ALLOCATION ALGORITHM TO PERFORM THE TASK OF ORGANISING AND OPERATING A PROVISION OF A SERVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-enabled method for creating a volumetric space/time framework that incorporates the floor plan of a venue and utilising the volumetric space/time framework, to incorporate a plurality of constraints within the space including one or more of furniture, equipment, staffing, resources, forecasts and revenue, and providing information regarding a plurality of items of equipment allocated to the volumetric space/time framework, the plurality of constraints being associated with the production of one or more products and the delivery of one or more services provided by the venue.

<claims>
1. A computer-enabled method for creating a volumetric space/time framework that incorporates the floor plan of a venue and utilising the volumetric space/time framework, to incorporate a plurality of constraints within the space including one or more of furniture, equipment, staffing, resources, forecasts and revenue, and providing information regarding a plurality of items of equipment allocated to the volumetric space/time framework, the plurality of constraints being associated with the production of one or more products and the delivery of one or more services provided by the venue, comprising the steps of,
providing an operations user interface in communication with an operations module executable on a computing system, the user interface being arranged to allow an operator to enter information regarding the plurality of items of equipment, available or required staff or other resources required for each one of the plurality of items of equipment including spatial and qualitative attributes arranged to describe functions and spatial placement of the equipment,
whereby the spatial and qualitative attributes of the equipment are associated with one or more of the one or more products and the one or more services provided,
whereby the equipment is linked to the one or more products and the one or more services to determine the ability of the equipment to provide one or more of the plurality of products and services to one or more orders or bookings requesting at least one of the one or more products and the one or more services, whereby the status of the equipment determines the availability of one or more products and services,
whereby, information is provided as to the making of the product or service and if one or more of the products and services is not available, a booking system associated with the equipment is updated to one of modify and remove the one or more of the products and services on the volumetric space/time framework,
whereby on execution of the order or dynamic booking allocation, the framework is arranged to produce an optimised allocation instruction set for the one or more spaces and the associated orders or bookings, whereby the optimised allocation instruction set is saved in a database and displayed by a space allocation user interface to one or more users.
2. A computer-enabled method in accordance with claim 1, comprising the further step of the operations module being in communication with a bookings allocation module, whereby the availability of one or more of the plurality of products and services as determined by the operations module is provided to the bookings module to cause the bookings module to vary at least one of a prospective booking and a potential booking.
3. A computer-enabled method in accordance with claim 1, comprising the further step of the information including a maintenance schedule, the maintenance schedule being utilised to determine dates and times at which the equipment is not available, whereby, if one or more of the plurality of products and services is not available as a result of equipment not being available, a booking system associated with the equipment system is updated to remove the one of the plurality of products and services.
4. A computer-enabled method in accordance with claim 1, 2, or 3, whereby the operations user interface is arranged to receive input from the user, the input including information regarding the status of one or more piece of equipment.
5. A computer-enabled method in accordance with any one of the preceding claims, comprising the further step of providing a furniture interface, the furniture interface allowing the user to include information including attributes arranged to describe physical characteristics of the furniture, whereby the status of the furniture determines the ability for a booking to be allocated, whereby information regarding the furniture is communicated to the booking module.
6. A computer-enabled method in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 3, whereby one or more of the pieces of equipment includes an electronic interface arranged to electronically communicate a status of the equipment to the operations server to update the status of the equipment.
7. A computer-enabled method in accordance with any one of the preceding claims, whereby the operations user interface is integrated into a restaurant management system interface, whereby a change in one interface is reflected in other interfaces or the system interface.
8. A computer enabled method with any one of claims 1 to 7, whereby the venue is a restaurant.
9. A computer-enabled method for creating a volumetric space/time framework that incorporates the floor plan of an enterprise and utilising the volumetric space/time framework, to incorporate a plurality of constraints within the space including one or more of furniture, equipment, staffing, resources, forecasts and revenue, and providing information regarding a plurality of items of equipment allocated to the volumetric space/time framework, the plurality of constraints being associated with the production of one or more products and the delivery of one or more services provided by the enterprise, comprising the steps of,
providing an operations user interface in communication with an operations module executable on a computing system, the user interface being arranged to allow an operator to enter information regarding the plurality of items of equipment, available or required staff or other resources required for each one of the plurality of items of equipment including spatial and qualitative attributes arranged to describe functions and spatial placement of the equipment,
whereby the spatial and qualitative attributes of the equipment are associated with one or more of the one or more products and the one or more services provided, whereby the equipment is linked to the one or more products and the one or more services to determine the ability of the equipment to provide one or more of the plurality of products and services to one or more orders or bookings requesting at least one of the one or more products and the one or more services,
whereby the status of the equipment determines the availability of one or more products and services, whereby, information is provided as to the making of the product or service and if one or more of the products and services is not available, a booking system associated with the equipment is updated to one of modify and remove the one or more of the products and services on the volumetric space/time framework,
whereby on execution of the order or dynamic booking allocation, the framework is arranged to produce an optimised allocation instruction set for the one or more spaces and the associated orders or bookings, whereby the optimised allocation instruction set is saved in a database and displayed by a space allocation user interface to one or more users.
10. A computer enabled method with claim 9, whereby the enterprise is one of a beauty salon, hairdresser, gym, travel or vehicle provision service, accommodation, sporting or concert venue, workspace, repair workshop, factory, office or other type of workplace.
