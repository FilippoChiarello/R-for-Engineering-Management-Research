<title>
AUTOMATIC DETECTION OF CONTEXT SWITCH TRIGGERS
</title>

<abstract>
A method, system, and computer program product include providing a list of triggers, training the natural language processor with the list of triggers, providing to the natural language processor a text including one trigger, selecting nodes in the text to create an original potential span, predicting whether the original potential span includes another trigger, and adjusting, in response to predicting that the original potential span includes another trigger, the original potential span to exclude the another trigger to create a new potential span.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of using a natural language processor, the method comprising: providing a list of triggers; training the natural language processor with the list of triggers; providing to the natural language processor a text including a first trigger; selecting a plurality of nodes in the text to create an original potential span; predicting whether the original potential span includes a second trigger; and adjusting, in response to predicting that the original potential span includes the second trigger, the original potential span to exclude the second trigger to create a new potential span.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first trigger is a hypothetical trigger that signifies a contextual span in the text.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the second trigger is a confirm trigger that signifies a factual span in the text.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the second trigger is not included in the list of triggers.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: retraining the natural language processor using the original potential span.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: predicting whether the new potential span includes the second trigger; and determining, in response to predicting that the new potential span does not include the second trigger, that the new potential span is a hypothetical span.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein predicting whether the original potential span includes the second trigger comprises: finding a probability that the original potential span includes the second trigger; and comparing the probability to a threshold.
8. A system comprising: a computing processor; and a memory coupled to the computing processor, wherein the memory comprises instructions which, when executed by the computing processor, specifically configures the computing processor and causes the computing processor to: provide a list of triggers; train a natural language processor with the list of triggers; provide to the natural language processor a text including a first trigger; select a plurality of nodes in the text to create an original potential span; predict whether the original potential span includes a second trigger; and adjust, in response to predicting that the original potential span includes the second trigger, the original potential span to exclude the second trigger to create a new potential span.
9. The system of claim 8, further comprising: a hypothetical span analyzer; a hypothetical dictionary data structure; and a factual dictionary data structure.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the first trigger is a hypothetical trigger that signifies a contextual span in the text.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the second trigger is a confirm trigger that signifies a factual span in the text.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the second trigger is not included in the list of triggers.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the memory further comprises instructions which, when executed by the computing processor, specifically configures the computing processor and causes the computing processor to: retrain the natural language processor using the original potential span.
14. The system of claim 8, wherein the memory further comprises instructions which, when executed by the computing processor, specifically configures the computing processor and causes the computing processor to: predict whether the new potential span includes the second trigger; and determine, in response to predicting that the new potential span does not include the second trigger, that the new potential span is a hypothetical span.
15. A computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having a computer readable program stored therein to process natural language text, wherein the computer readable program, when executed on a computing device, specifically configures the computing device, and causes the computing device to: provide a list of triggers; train a natural language processor with the list of triggers; provide to the natural language processor a text including a first trigger; select a plurality of nodes in the text to create an original potential span; predict whether the original potential span includes a second trigger; and adjust, in response to predicting that the original potential span includes the second trigger, the original potential span to exclude the second trigger to create a new potential span.
16. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the first trigger is a hypothetical trigger that signifies a contextual span in the text.
17. The computer program product of claim 16, wherein the second trigger is a confirm trigger that signifies a factual span in the text.
18. The computer program product of claim 17, wherein the second trigger is not included in the list of triggers.
19. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the computer readable program, when executed on a computing device, further specifically configures the computing device, and causes the computing device to: retrain the natural language processor using the original potential span.
20. The computer program product of claim 15, wherein the computer readable program, when executed on a computing device, further specifically configures the computing device, and causes the computing device to: predict whether the new potential span includes the second trigger; and determine, in response to predicting that the new potential span does not include the second trigger, that the new potential span is a hypothetical span.
