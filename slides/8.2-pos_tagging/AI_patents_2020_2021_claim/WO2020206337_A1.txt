METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR CYSTOSCOPIC IMAGING INCORPORATING MACHINE LEARNING
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and machine learning systems to identify cancers, tumors, and/or other abnormalities present in a person's bladder, while additional embodiments will also identify benign or native structures or features in a person's bladder. Further embodiments incorporate such systems into cystoscopy equipment to allow for real time and/or immediate detection of cancers, tumors, and/or other abnormalities present in a person's bladder during a cystoscopy procedure.

<claims>
1 . A method for identifying a bladder tumor comprising:
obtaining a video of a cystoscopic exam;
segmenting an area of concern present in the video;
recording details about the area of concern; and
providing details about the area of concern to a practitioner.
2. The method of claim 1 , wherein the obtaining step is obtained from a live cystoscopic exam.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the live cystoscopic exam is accomplished using white light cystoscopy.
4. The method of claim 1 , wherein the segmenting an area of concern step uses a machine learning algorithm comprising a convolutional neural network.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the convolutional neural network is trained with annotated cystoscopic video.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the annotated cystoscopic video includes annotations of abnormal tissues and benign physiologies.
7. The method of claim 4, wherein the convolutional neural network comprises two stages.
8. The method of claim 4, wherein the convolutional neural network has a first stage and a second stage, wherein the first stage highlights an area of concern and the second stage segments a tumor.
9. The method of claim 1 , wherein the providing step is accomplished via video overlay during a subsequent cystoscopic exam.
10. The method of claim 1 , further comprising obtaining patient information, wherein the patient information comprises at least one of the group consisting of: age, sex, gender, and medical history.
1 1 . The method of claim 1 , wherein the segmenting step highlights the area of concern on a video monitor.
12. The method of claim 1 , further comprising characterizing the area of concern.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the characterizing step comprises at least one of the group consisting of: identifying the area of concern, locating the area of concern, and determining the size of the area of concern.
14. The method of claim 12 wherein the characterizing step comprises identifying the area of concern and excluding the area of concern, if the area of concern is benign.
15. The method of claim 1 , further comprising treating the patient for a tumor.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein treating the patient comprises at least one of the group consisting of: resecting the tumor, introducing an anti-cancer drug to the bladder, and introducing an anti-cancer drug to the tumor.
17. A method for treating a bladder tumor comprising:
obtaining a video from a live white light cystoscopic exam;
obtaining patient information, wherein the patient information comprises at least one of the group consisting of: age, sex, gender, and medical history; segmenting an area of concern present in the video using a machine learning algorithm comprising a convolutional neural network trained with annotated cystoscopic video, wherein the annotated video includes annotations of abnormal tissues and benign physiologies, wherein the segmenting step highlights the area of concern on a video monitor;
characterizing the area of concern, wherein characterizing the area of concern comprises at least one of the group consisting of: identifying the area of concern, locating the area of concern, and determining the size of the area of concern, wherein characterizing the area of concern further comprises excluding the area of concern, if the area of concern is benign;
recording details about the area of concern;
providing details about the area of concern to a practitioner; and
treating the patient for a tumor; wherein treating the patient comprises at least one of the group consisting of: resecting the tumor, introducing an anti-cancer drug to the bladder, and introducing an anti-cancer drug to the tumor.
