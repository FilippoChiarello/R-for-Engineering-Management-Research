<title>
CONVERSATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR AUTOMATED SELF-SERVICE ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
</title>

<abstract>
Described are computer-implemented platform, systems, and methods for automated self-service account management utilizing a telephony system and a conversational artificial intelligence system to identify and execute intended account management tasks.
</abstract>

<claims>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A computer-implemented platform for automated self-service account management
comprising a host data store, a telephony system, and conversational artificial intelligence system:
the host data store comprising historic call data and account data;
the telephony system configured to:
a) receive free-form speech from a caller; b) transcribe the free-form speech to generate a speech utterance; and
c) provide the speech utterance to the conversational artificial intelligence system; the conversational artificial intelligence system configured to:
a) parse and tokenize the speech utterance;
b) query the host data store to retrieve historic call data and account data for the caller; and
c) apply a machine learning model to the tokenized speech utterance and the historic call data and account data for the caller to:
i) identify an intended objective of the caller in relation to one or more pre defined account management tasks; and
ii) execute the intended objective; or
iii) establish a corollary to respond to the caller in a conversational format via the telephony system for affirmation or additional data needed to execute the intended objective.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model comprises an artificial neural network (ANN).
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the account is a credit account.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more pre-defmed tasks comprises: get
information about an account or make a payment on an account.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the conversational artificial intelligence system is further configured to execute any number of parallel tasks relating to account management or retrieval of decisioning data points relating to the caller.
6. The system of claim 1, further configured to comprehensively answer specific caller inquiries throughout the call experience.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the conversational artificial intelligence system is further configured to provide a log tracking process for a person-in-the4oop procedure in order to create supervised transition probabilities.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the telephony system is further configured to provide an interactive voice response (IVR) system.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the telephony system is further configured to receive dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling.
10. A computer-implemented method for providing automated self-service account
management services, the method comprising:
a) maintaining a host data store comprising historic call data and account data; d) receiving, via a telephony system, free-form speech from a caller;
e) transcribing the free-form speech to generate a speech utterance;
d) parsing and tokenizing the speech utterance; e) querying the host data store to retrieve historic call data and account data for the caller; and
f) applying a machine learning model to the tokenized speech utterance and the historic call data and account data for the caller to:
i) identify an intended objective of the caller in relation to one or more pre defined account management tasks; and
ii) execute the intended objective; or
iii) establish a corollary to respond to the caller in a conversational format via the telephony system for affirmation or additional data needed to execute the intended objective. 11 The method of claim 10, wherein the machine learning model comprises an artificial neural network (ANN).
12. The method of claim 10, wherein the account is a credit account.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein the one or more pre-defmed tasks comprises: get
information about an account or make a payment on an account.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein applying the machine learning model comprises
executing any number of parallel tasks relating to account management or retrieval of decisioning data points relating to the caller.
15. The method of claim 10, wherein the method further comprises comprehensively
answering specific caller inquiries throughout the call experience.
16. The method of claim 10, wherein the method further comprises providing a log tracking process for a person-in-the4oop procedure in order to create supervised transition probabilities.
17. The method of claim 10, wherein the method further comprises receiving interactive voice responses (IVR).
18. The method of claim 10, wherein the method further comprises receiving dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) signaling.
