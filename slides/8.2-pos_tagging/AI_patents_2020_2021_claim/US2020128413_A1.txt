Systems And Methods For Providing Services
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for providing services are disclosed. One method can comprise receiving data having a first format and transmitting the data to a first device. The method may also comprise detecting a second device, automatically recognizing a supported second format of the detected second device, converting the data to the second format, and transmitting the converted data to the second device via wireless communication.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving, by a computing device, from a user device, first content in a first format; converting, by the computing device, the first content from the first format to a second format; and generating, by the computing device, an output comprising one or more of the first content or the converted first content.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first content is compatible with a high definition multimedia interface (HDMI).
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the computing device comprises a discovery element.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the first format comprises a mobile device format comprising one or more of 3GP, 3G2, MP4, or H.264 main level.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the second format is based on one or more of compatibility, connectivity, resolution, or bit-rate.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the output comprises a combination of the first content and the converted first content.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the output comprises one or more of the first content and the converted first content merged together or the first content and the converted first content overlaid relative to each other.
8. A system comprising: a user device configured to send first content in a first format; and a computing device configured to: receive, from the user device, the first content in the first format; convert the first content from the first format to a second format; and generate an output comprising one or more of the first content or the converted first content.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the first content is compatible with one or more of a high definition multimedia interface (HDMI), internet protocol (IP), radio frequency (RF), WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA), Digital Living Network Alliance (DNA), OpenCable, Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB), and S-video.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the computing device comprises a discovery element.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the first format comprises a mobile device format comprising one or more of 3GP, 3G2, MP4, or H.264 main level.
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the second format is based on one or more of compatibility, connectivity, resolution, or bit-rate.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the output comprises a combination of the first content and the converted first content.
14. The system of claim 8, further comprising a display device to display the output, wherein the output comprises one or more of the first content and the converted first content merged together or the first content and the converted first content overlaid relative to each other.
15. An apparatus comprising: one or more processors; and memory storing processor executable instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the apparatus to: receive, from the user device, first content in a first format; convert the first content from the first format to a second format; and generate an output comprising one or more of the first content or the converted first content.
16. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the output comprises a combination of the first content and the converted first content.
17. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the computing device comprises a discovery element.
18. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the first format comprises a mobile device format comprising one or more of 3GP, 3G2, MP4, or H.264 main level.
19. The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the second format is based on one or more of compatibility, connectivity, resolution, or bit-rate.
20. The apparatus of claim 18, wherein the memory storing processor executable instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, further causes the apparatus to display the output as one or more of merged or overlaid images.
