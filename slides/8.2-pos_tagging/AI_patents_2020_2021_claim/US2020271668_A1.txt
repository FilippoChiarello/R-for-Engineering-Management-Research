METHODS FOR DIAGNOSING AND TREATING EOSINOPHILIC GASTRITIS
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to methods for diagnosing, monitoring, and optionally treating eosinophilic gastritis (EG) and/or eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE), the methods comprising assaying one or more tissue, serum, or plasma biomarkers in a biological sample from the subject.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for diagnosing, monitoring, and optionally treating eosinophilic gastritis (EG) or eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) in a subject in need thereof, the method comprising assaying a biological sample from the subject for one or more biomarkers and diagnosing the subject as having EG or EGE based on biomarker assay.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more biomarkers is selected from a gene expression biomarker comprising the expression of one or more genes and a protein biomarker, which may comprise one or more proteins, or a peptide or polypeptide fragment(s) thereof.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the biological sample is a gastric tissue sample if the biomarker is a gene expression biomarker, or a plasma or serum fraction of a blood sample if the biomarker is a protein biomarker.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the gene expression biomarker comprises one or more genes selected from, or is a panel of genes consisting of, ATPase, H+/K+ transporting subunit alpha (ATP4A), bone morphogenetic protein 3 (BMP-3), cadherin 26 (CDH26), C-C motif chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18), C-C motif chemokine ligand 26 (CCL26), collagen type II alpha 1 chain (COL2A1), Charcot-Leyden crystal galectin (CLC), defensin beta 1 (DEFB1), gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor, alpha 1 subunit (GABRA1), gliomedin (GLDN), interleukin 5 (IL-5), interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 2 (IL13RA2), Kallikrein-related peptidase 7 (KLK7), mucin 4, cell-surface associated (MUC4), neuropeptidase Y (NPY), solute carrier family 26 member 7 (SLC26A7), somatostatin (SST), and tachykinin precursor 1 (TAC1), and combinations of the foregoing.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the gene expression biomarker is a panel of genes consisting of ATP4A, BMP-3, CDH26, CCL18, CCL26, COL2A1, CLC, DEFB1, GABRA1, GLDN, IL-5, IL13RA2, KLK7, MUC4, NPY, SLC26A7, SST, and TAC1.
6. The method of claim 2, wherein the protein biomarker comprises one or more proteins, or a peptide or polypeptide fragment(s) thereof, selected from, or is a panel consisting of, C-C motif chemokine ligand 26 (CCL26), C-C motif chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17), interleukin 5 (IL-5), and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP).
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the biological sample is plasma and the protein biomarker comprises one or more of CCL26, IL-5, and CCL17.
8. The method of claim 6, wherein the biological sample is serum and the protein biomarker comprises one or more of CCL26, IL-5, and TSLP.
9. A method for distinguishing EG/EGE from another gastrointestinal disorder, the method comprising assaying a biological sample from the subject for a biomarker according to claim 4 and diagnosing the subject as having EG or EGE based on biomarker assay.
10. The method of claim 7, wherein the other gastrointestinal disorder is selected from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), H. pylori gastritis, lymphocytic gastritis, reactive gastritis, granulomatous gastritis, H. heilmannii gastritis, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) gastritis.
11. The method of claim 1, further comprising administering an EG or EGE therapy to the subject diagnosed as having EG or EGE.
12. The method of claim 9, wherein the EG or EGE therapy is dietary therapy.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein the EG or EGE therapy comprises the administration of a therapeutic agent selected from the group consisting of a glucocorticoid, a leukotriene inhibitor, azathioprine, an anti-histamine, a mast-cell stabilizer, a macrolide antibiotic, and anti-cytokine therapy.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject is human.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein the method comprises an initial step of determining the amount of one or more protein biomarkers selected from CCL26, CCL17, IL-5, and TSLP in a plasma and/or serum fraction of a blood sample obtained from the subject, wherein an elevated expression of one or more of the protein biomarkers relative to a predetermined control value indicates a diagnosis of EG or EGE.
16. The method of claim 15, further comprising an initial step of obtaining a blood sample from the subject.
17. The method of claim 15, further comprising determining the expression of a panel of genes consisting of ATP4A, BMP-3, CDH26, CCL18, CCL26, COL2A1, CLC, DEFB1, GABRA1, GLDN, IL-5, IL13RA2, KLK7, MUC4, NPY, SLC26A7, SST, and TAC1 in the gastric tissue sample obtained from the subject, wherein the subject is diagnosed with EG or EGE based upon the cumulative gene expression of the panel of genes using a predetermined diagnostic cutoff value.
18. The method of claim 15, further comprising an initial step of obtaining a gastric tissue sample from the subject.
