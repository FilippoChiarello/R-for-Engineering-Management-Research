EARLY-STAGE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AUTOANTIBODY BIOMARKERS, TARGET ANTIGENS AND DIAGNOSTIC USES THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention provides methods, compositions, and kits for the detection of Early-Stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) autoantibody biomarkers, for the diagnosis of Early-Stage AD, for the identification of a subject at risk for developing Early-Stage AD, and/or for the generation of patient-specific Early-Stage AD autoantibody biomarker profiles.

2. A method of generating a subject-specific, early-stage Alzheimer's disease-specific autoantibody profile, the method comprising: (a) contacting an immunoglobulin-containing biological sample from the subject with an antigen set comprising at least two antigens selected from the group consisting of BC053664.1, BC012104.1, BC029796.1, NM_000159.2, and NM_001098.2; under conditions under which each antigen from the antigen set can form an immunocomplex with its corresponding autoantibody if present in the biological sample; (b) detecting whether the immunocomplex of each antigen and its corresponding autoantibody is formed, wherein formation of an antigen-autoantibody immunocomplex indicates that the autoantibody is present in the biological sample, and (c) generating a subject-specific early-stage Alzheimer's Disease-specific autoantibody profile of the autoantibodies present in the biological sample.
