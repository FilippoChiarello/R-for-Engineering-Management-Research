<title>
Interactive electronic assignment of services to providers based on custom criteria
</title>

<abstract>
A service provider matching system can receive service provider data and preferences, customer data and preferences, and a customer request for service and determine matching scores for one or more matching service providers. Based on a threshold value, the service providers with a matching score above the threshold can be presented to a customer for selection. Upon selection by a customer, an assisted interaction can take place between the customer and one or more selected service providers to agree to particular terms related to a requested service, book a service appointment, and track the progress until completion.
