<title>
Method, device and system for remote deep learning for microscopic image reconstruction and segmentation
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a method of training a network for reconstructing and/or segmenting microscopic images comprising the step of training the network in the cloud. Further, for training the network in the cloud training data comprising microscopic images can be uploaded into the cloud and a network is trained by the microscopic images. Moreover, for training the network the network can be benchmarked after the reconstructing and/or segmenting of the microscopic images. Wherein for benchmarking the network the quality of the image(s) having undergone the reconstructing and/or segmenting by the network can be compared with the quality of the image(s) having undergone reconstructing and/or segmenting by already known algorithm and/or a second network.
