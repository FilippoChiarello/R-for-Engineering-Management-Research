</title>

<abstract>
A method for warning by detecting an abnormal state of a driver of a vehicle based on deep learning is provided. The method includes steps of: a driver state detecting device (a) inputting an interior image of the vehicle into a drowsiness detecting network, to detect a facial part of the driver, detect an eye part from the facial part, detect a blinking state of an eye to determine a drowsiness state, and inputting the interior image into a pose matching network, to detect body keypoints of the driver, determine whether the body keypoints match one of preset driving postures, to determine the abnormal state; and (b) if the driver is in a hazardous state referring to part of the drowsiness state and the abnormal state, transmitting information on the hazardous state to nearby vehicles over vehicle-to-vehicle communication to allow nearby drivers to perceive the hazardous state.
