CARTRIDGES FOR VAPORIZER DEVICES
</title>

<abstract>
Cartridges for vaporizer devices are provided. In one exemplary embodiment, a cartridge (100) can include a reservoir housing (102) that includes a reservoir chamber (108) configured to selectively hold a vaporizable material, and an atomizer (104) in fluid communication with the reservoir chamber. The atomizer includes a substrate (114) having an array of ordered pores (116) configured to draw a predetermined volume of vaporizable material from the reservoir chamber at a predetermined rate, and at least one heating material (118) configured to selectively heat the at least a portion of the vaporizable material drawn into the substrate to generate a vaporized material. Vaporizer devices are also provided.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A cartridge for a vaporizer device, the cartridge comprising:
a reservoir housing including a reservoir chamber configured to selectively hold a vaporizable material; and
an atomizer in fluid communication with the reservoir chamber, the atomizer comprising:
a substrate having an array of ordered pores, the ordered pores being configured to draw a predetermined volume of vaporizable material from the reservoir chamber at a predetermined rate, and
at least one heating material configured to selectively heat the at least a portion of the vaporizable material drawn into the substrate to generate a vaporized material.
2. The cartridge of claim 1, wherein the substrate is in the form of a honeycomb structure.
3. The cartridge of claim 1, wherein the substrate comprises an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane.
4. The cartridge of claim 1, wherein the at least one heating material is formed from a metal alloy.
5. The cartridge of claim 1, wherein the ordered pores are plated with the at least one heating material.
6. The cartridge of claim 1, wherein the substrate extends from a first surface to a second surface that is opposite the first surface, and wherein at least the first surface is positioned within the reservoir chamber and a layer of the at least one heating material is disposed on the second surface.
7. The cartridge of claim 1, wherein the atomizer further includes at least one thermally insulating material disposed on at least a portion of the substrate.
8. The cartridge of claim 7, wherein the at least one thermally insulating material comprises silicon dioxide.
9. The cartridge of claim 7, wherein the at least one thermally insulating material is in the form of a tubular member having a lumen defined therein, and wherein the substrate resides within the lumen.
10. The cartridge of claim 1, wherein each pore has a diameter from about 1 nm to 1000 nm.
11. The cartridge of claim 1, wherein each pore has a length that extends from a first end to a second end, and wherein the length is between about 0 microns and 10 microns.
12. A vaporizer device, comprising:
a vaporizer body; and
a cartridge that is selectively coupled to and removable from the vaporizer body, the cartridge including:
a reservoir housing including a reservoir chamber configured to selectively hold a vaporizable material; and
an atomizer in fluid communication with the reservoir chamber, the atomizer comprising:
a substrate having an array of ordered pores, the ordered pores being configured to draw a predetermined volume of vaporizable material from the reservoir chamber at a predetermined rate, and
at least one heating material configured to selectively heat the at least a portion of the vaporizable material drawn into the substrate to generate a vaporized material.
13. The vaporizer device of claim 12, wherein the substrate is in the form of a honeycomb structure.
14. The vaporizer device of claim 12, wherein the substrate comprises an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane.
15. The vaporizer device of claim 12, wherein the at least one heating material is formed from a metal alloy.
16. The vaporizer device of claim 12, wherein the ordered pores are plated with the at least one heating material.
17. The vaporizer device of claim 12, wherein the substrate extends from a first surface to a second surface that is opposite the first surface, and wherein at least the first surface is positioned within the reservoir chamber and a layer of the at least one heating material is disposed on the second surface.
18. The vaporizer device of claim 12, wherein the atomizer further includes at least one thermally insulating material disposed on at least a portion of the substrate.
19. The vaporizer device of claim 18, wherein the at least one thermally insulating material comprises silicon dioxide.
20. The vaporizer device of claim 18, wherein the at least one thermally insulating material is in the form of a tubular member having a lumen defined therein, and wherein the substrate resides within the lumen.
21. The vaporizer device of claim 12, wherein each pore has a diameter from about 1 nm to 1000 nm.
22. The vaporizer device of claim 12, wherein each pore has a length that extends from a first end to a second end, and wherein the length is between about 0 microns and 10 microns.
