<title>
Control message from streaming source to facilitate scaling
</title>

<abstract>
A cloud computing service is used to deploy a virtual computer cluster. The virtual computer cluster is initialized with a set of one or more streaming nodes for processing first messages of one or more streaming jobs. It is determined whether the virtual computer cluster is to process second messages of a non-streaming job. In response to determining that the virtual computer cluster is to process the second messages of the non-streaming job, for example using control messages, the cloud computing service is caused to start a non-streaming node in the virtual computer cluster. The non-streaming node is tasked to process the second messages of the non-streaming job.
