<title>
APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR SECURE INTERPROCESS MESSAGING
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus includes a processor configured to execute non-transitory machine readable program instructions. The processor is configured to associate a sending application with a first security category and associate a receiving application with a second security category. The processor is configured to receive, in a message router an inter-process message from the sending application, wherein the inter-process message includes an indication of the sending application and the receiving application. The processor determines a permission for the inter-process message based on the first security category and the second security category. When the permission is granted, the processor forwards the inter-process message to the receiving application, and when the permission is denied, the processor blocks the inter-process message. Associating the first and second applications with security categories significantly simplifies configuration of messaging rules and security policies for applications installed on a computing apparatus.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. An apparatus (100) comprising:
a processor (152) configured to execute non-transitory machine readable program instructions, wherein the processor (152) is configured to:
associate a sending application (108) with a first security category;
associate a receiving application (112) with a second security category; receive, in a message router (116), an inter-process message (128) from the sending application (108), wherein the inter-process message (128) comprises an indication of the sending application (108) and the receiving application (112);
determine a permission for the inter-process message (128) based on the first security category and the second security category; and
when the permission is granted, forward the inter-process message (128) to the receiving application (112); and when the permission is denied, block the inter-process message (128).
2. The apparatus (100) of claim 1 wherein the inter-process message (128) comprises an indication of a type of message, and wherein the processor (152) is configured to determine the permission for the inter-process message (128) based on the type of the message, wherein the type of the message comprises one or more of a kind of action and a kind of data being acted upon.
3. The apparatus (100) according to any one of claims 1 or 2 wherein the processor (152) is configured to: modify a state of the processor (152) based on the inter-process message (128), and
determine the permission for the inter-process message (128) based on the modified state of the processor (152). 4. The apparatus (100) according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the processor
(152) is configured to determine one or more of the first security category and the second security category based on information related to one or more of the sending application (108) and the receiving application (112), wherein the information related to the one or more of the sending application (108) and the receiving application (112) comprises one or more of: a virus scan (122), data obtained from a social proof service (124), input from a user (126) of the apparatus (100), installation information (202), vendor entitlements (204), application specific security requirements (206), and a machine learning application (208).
5. The apparatus (100) according to claim 4 wherein the processor (152) is configured to give priority to user inputs when determining the one or more of the first security category and the second security category.
6. The apparatus (100) according to claim 4 wherein the processor (152) is configured to determine the one or more of the first security category and the second security category based on vendor entitlements when the installation information indicates the one or more of the sending application (108) and the receiving application (112) originated from an untrusted source.
7. The apparatus (100) according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the processor
(152) is configured to change the one or more of the first security category and the second security category to a more trusted security category when the permission of the inter-process message (128) has not been denied for a pre-determined amount of time or a pre-determined amount of inter-process messages have been sent between the sending application (108) and the receiving application (112). 8. The apparatus (100) according to any one of the preceding claims wherein each security category is associated with one or more messaging policies, and wherein the processor (152) is configured to dynamically modify the one or more messaging policies.
9. The apparatus (100) according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the one or more of the sending application and the receiving application are members of a group of highly protected applications and wherein the processor (152) is configured to associate a highly protected security category with the group of protected applications, wherein the group of protected applications is defined by one or more of: a provider of the application, vendor entitlements, and user input.
10. The apparatus (100) according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the processor (152) is configured to record in a messaging history (140) the permission and associated inter-process message information, and wherein the processor (152) is configured to modify the one or more of the first security category and the second security category based on the messaging history.
11. The apparatus (100) according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the processor (152) is configured to associate the sending application with a first one or more security categories, associate the receiving application with a second one or more security categories, and to determine the permission for the inter-process message (128) based on the first one or more security categories and the second one or more security categories.
12. The apparatus (100) according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the first security category is the same as the second security category.
13. A method (300) comprising:
associating (302) a sending application with a first security category; associating (304) a receiving application with a second security category;
receiving (306) in a message router, an inter-process message from the sending application, wherein the inter-process message comprises an indication of the sending application and the receiving application;
determining (308) a permission for the inter-process message based on the first security category and the second security category; and
when the permission is granted, forwarding (412) the inter-process message to the receiving application; and when the permission is denied, blocking (416) the inter process message.
14. The method (300) according to claim 13 comprising determining one or more of the first security category and the second security category based on information related to one or more of the sending application and the receiving application, wherein the information related to the one or more of the sending application and the receiving application comprises one or more of: a virus scan, data obtained from a social proof service, input from a user of the apparatus, installation information, vendor entitlements, application specific security requirements, and a machine learning application.
15. A non-transitory computer readable media having stored thereon program instructions that when executed by a processor (152) are configured to cause the processor (102) to perform the method of any of claims 13 or 14.
