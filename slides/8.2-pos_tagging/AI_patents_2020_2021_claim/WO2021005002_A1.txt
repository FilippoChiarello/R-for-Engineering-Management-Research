<abstract>
The present invention relates to a method for predicting whether a subject having a tumor responds to a tumor therapy selected from (i) an immunotherapy, (ii) a chemotherapy, (iii) an anti-hormonal therapy, and (iv) an anti-tyrosin kinase therapy, wherein the method comprises (A) determining the level(s) of at least one nucleic acid molecule and/or at least one protein or peptide in a sample obtained from said subject, wherein the at least one nucleic acid molecule is selected from nucleic acid molecules (a) encoding a polypeptide comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs 1 to 6, (b) consisting of the nucleotide sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs 7 to 12, (c) encoding a polypeptide which is at least 85% identical, preferably at least 90% identical, and most preferred at least 95% identical to the amino acid sequence of (a), (d) consisting of a nucleotide sequence which is at least 95% identical, preferably at least 96% identical, and most preferred at least 98% identical to the nucleotide sequence of (b), (e) consisting of a nucleotide sequence which is degenerate with respect to the nucleic acid molecule of (d), (f) consisting of a fragment of the nucleic acid molecule of any one of (a) to (e), said fragment comprising at least 150 nucleotides, preferably at least 300 nucleotides, more preferably at least 450 nucleotides, and most preferably at least 600 nucleotides, and (g) corresponding to the nucleic acid molecule of any one of (a) to (f), wherein T is replaced by U, and wherein the at least one protein or peptide is selected from proteins or peptides being encoded by the nucleic acid molecule of any one of (a) to (g); and (B) comparing the level(s) of (A) with the level(s) of the at least one nucleic acid molecule and/or the at least one protein or peptide in a sample obtained from one or more subjects that responded to one or more of the therapies of (i) to (iii) or a corresponding pre-determined standard, wherein increased level(s) of (A) as compared to the level(s) or pre-determined standard of (B) indicate(s) that the subject will not respond to the tumor therapy and substantially the same or decreased level(s) of (A) as compared to the level(s) of (B) indicate(s) that the subject will respond to the tumor therapy; or (B') comparing the level(s) of (A) with the level(s) of the at least one nucleic acid molecule and/or the at least one protein or peptide in a sample obtained from one or more subjects that did not respond to one or more of the therapies of (i) to (iii) or a corresponding pre-determined standard, wherein decreased level(s) of (A) as compared to the level(s) or pre-determined standard of (B') indicate(s) that the subject will respond to the tumor therapy and substantially the same or increased level(s) of (A) as compared to the level(s) of (B') indicate(s) that the subject will not respond to the tumor therapy.
