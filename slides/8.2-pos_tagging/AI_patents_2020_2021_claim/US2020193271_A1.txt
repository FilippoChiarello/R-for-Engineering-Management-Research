SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR VIGOROUS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for predicting a characteristic of an object in an artificial intelligence system. The method includes evaluating the object using a first model to produce a first prediction of a characteristic of the object. The object is evaluated using a second model to produce a second prediction of the characteristic of the object, the second model being dissimilar to the first model. A final prediction of the characteristic of the object is generated as a function of dynamic weightings of the first prediction and the second prediction.

<claims>
1. A method of characterizing an object input to an artificial intelligence (AI) system, comprising: evaluating said object using a first model to produce a first prediction of a characteristic of said object; evaluating said object using a second model to produce a second prediction of said characteristic of said object, said second model being dissimilar to said first model; and generating a final prediction of said characteristic of said object as a function of dynamic weightings of said first prediction and said second prediction.
2. The method recited in claim 1, wherein evaluating said object using said first or second model further comprises determining a quality of said first or second prediction, respectively.
3. The method recited in claim 2, wherein said quality comprises a measure of the confidence in said prediction.
4. The method recited in claim 2, wherein said dynamic weightings are a function of said quality.
5. The method recited in claim 1, wherein said dynamic weightings are a function of at least one external input.
6. The method recited in claim 1, wherein said dynamic weightings are a function of at least one predefined rule.
