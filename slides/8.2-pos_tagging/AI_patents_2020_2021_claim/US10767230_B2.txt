<title>
MicroRNA biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are methods of determining the likelihood of a subject having or developing a gastric cancer. The methods comprise measuring the expression level of at least one miRNA having at least 90% sequence identity with an miRNA as described herein in a non-cellular biofluid sample obtained from the subject, wherein differential expression of miRNA expression in the sample obtained from the subject, as compared to a control, may be indicative of the subject having gastric cancer and wherein the miRNA may be either an miRNA listed as "up-regulated" or an miRNA listed as "down-regulated". Also disclosed is a method of determining the likelihood of a subject having or developing a stage of a gastric cancer.

1. A method of treating a gastric cancer, wherein the method comprises: a) detecting or diagnosing a gastric cancer in a subject or determining a likelihood of a subject having said gastric cancer, wherein detecting or diagnosing said gastric cancer in the subject or determining the likelihood of the subject having said gastric cancer comprises: i) determining, in a non-cellular biofluid sample obtained from the subject, the expression level of at least six microRNAs (miRNAs) each having at least 90% sequence identity with an miRNA selected from the group consisting of hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-103a-3p, hsa-miR-20a-5p, hsa-miR-181a-5p, hsa-miR-142-5p, hsa-miR-27a-5p, hsa-miR-26a-5p, hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-616-5p, hsa-miR-30a-5p, hsa-miR-532-5p and hsa-miR-30e-5p, ii) determining differential expression of miRNA in the sample, as compared to a control in order to determine the subject to have said gastric cancer or diagnose the subject as having said gastric cancer or determine the likelihood of the subject to develop said gastric cancer, wherein the differential expression of miRNA is an upregulation or a downregulation of miRNA expression of the at least six miRNAs and b) treating the subject determined to have or diagnosed with said gastric cancer or having the likelihood of developing said gastric cancer with an anti-gastric cancer compound or a combination of anti-gastric cancer compounds.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the control is a sample obtained from a gastric cancer free subject.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the at least six miRNAs comprise hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-103a-3p, hsa-miR-20a-5p, hsa-miR-181a-5p, hsa-miR-142-5p, hsa-miR-27a-5p, hsa-miR-26a-5p, hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-616-5p, hsa-miR-30a-5p, hsa-miR-532-5p and hsa-miR-30e-5p.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein the at least six miRNAs are identical to miRNAs selected from the group consisting of hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-103a-3p, hsa-miR-20a-5p, hsa-miR-181a-5p, hsa-miR-142-5p, hsa-miR-27a-5p, hsa-miR-26a-5p, hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-616-5p, hsa-miR-30a-5p, hsa-miR-532-5p and hsa-miR-30e-5p.
