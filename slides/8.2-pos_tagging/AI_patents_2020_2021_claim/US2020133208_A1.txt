OUTPUT DEVICE, CONTROL DEVICE AND METHOD OF OUTPUTTING EVALUATION FUNCTION VALUE
</title>

<abstract>
An object is to make it possible to acquire a parameter or a first physical quantity that has been learned and an evaluation function value and thereby check the progress or the result of machine learning. An output device includes: an information acquisition unit which acquires, from a machine learning device that performs machine learning on a servo control device for controlling a servo motor driving the axis of a machine tool, a robot or an industrial machine, a parameter or a first physical quantity of a constituent element of the servo control device that is being machine learned or has been machine learned and an evaluation function value; and an output unit which outputs information indicating a relationship between the acquired parameter, the first physical quantity or a second physical quantity determined from the parameter and the evaluation function value.

<claims>
1. An output device comprising: an information acquisition unit which acquires, from a machine learning device that, performs machine learning on a servo control device for controlling a servo motor driving an axis of a machine tool, a robot or an industrial machine, a parameter or a first physical quantity of a constituent element of the servo control device that is being machine learned or has been machine learned and an evaluation function value; and an output unit which outputs information indicating a relationship between the acquired parameter, the first physical quantity or a second physical quantity determined from the parameter and the evaluation function value.
2. The output device according to claim 1, wherein the output unit includes a display unit which displays, on a display screen, the information indicating the relationship between the parameter, the first physical quantity or the second physical quantity and the evaluation function value.
3. The output device according to claim 1, wherein the parameter is a coefficient in a transfer function of the constituent element of the servo control device, and based on the information, an instruction to change an order of the coefficient is provided to the servo control device.
4. The output device according to claim 1, wherein based on the information, an instruction to change or select the parameter of the constituent element of the servo control device or a search range of the machine learning of the first physical quantity is provided to the machine learning device.
5. The output device according to claim 1, wherein the parameter of the constituent element of the servo control device includes a parameter of a mathematical formula model or a filter.
6. The output device according to claim 5, wherein the mathematical formula model or the filter is included in a velocity feedforward processing unit or a position feedforward processing unit, and the parameter includes a coefficient in a transfer function of the filter.
7. A control device comprising: the output device according to claim 1; the servo control device which controls the servo motor that drives the axis of the machine tool, the robot or the industrial machine; and the machine learning device which performs the machine learning on the servo control device.
8. The control device according to claim 7, wherein the output device is included in one of the servo control device and the machine learning device.
9. A method of outputting an evaluation function value of an output device which is used in machine learning of a machine learning device that performs the machine learning on a servo control device for controlling a servo motor driving an axis of a machine tool, a robot or an industrial machine, the method comprising: acquiring, from the machine learning device, a parameter or a first physical quantity of a constituent element of the servo control device that is being machine learned or has been machine learned and the evaluation function value; and outputting information indicating a relationship between the acquired parameter, the first physical quantity or a second physical quantity determined from the parameter and the evaluation function value.
