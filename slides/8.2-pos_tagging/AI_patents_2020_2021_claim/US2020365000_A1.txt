DATA-SECURE SENSOR SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
In some embodiments, a data-secure sensor system includes one or more processors configured to receive sensor data (e.g., image data, audio data, etc.) and generate descriptive data based on the sensor data that corresponds to a physical area that corresponds to information about identified objects or activity in physical area, an input/output (I/O) port, and an I/O choke communicatively coupled between the one or more processors and the I/O port, the I/O choke configured to limit a communication bandwidth of the I/O port to a maximum data rate. The one or more processors can be configured to prevent the sensor data from being accessible via any external port of the data-secure camera system, including the I/O port, and allow the descriptive data to be accessible via the I/O port.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A data-secure system comprising: one or more processors configured to: receive sensor data corresponding to a physical area; and generate descriptive data based on the sensor data, the descriptive data being different than the sensor data, and the descriptive data corresponding to information that describes content captured by the sensor data specifically about identified objects or activity in the physical area; wherein the one or more processors are further configured to: prevent the sensor data from being accessible via any external port of the data-secure system; and allow the descriptive data to be accessible via the I/O port
2. The data-secure system of claim 1 wherein the sensor data is image data, wherein the descriptive data does not include the image data.
3. The data-secure system of claim 1 further comprising: a memory block, controlled by and only accessible by the one or more processors, the memory block configured to store the sensor data and corresponding descriptive data, wherein the memory block is inaccessible via any external port of the data-secure camera system including the I/O port, and wherein only the one or more processors have read and write access to the memory block.
4. The data-secure system of claim 1 wherein the one or more processors includes a machine learning (ML) processor configured to generate the descriptive data, wherein the data-secure system further includes: an input port; and a second memory block communicatively coupled between input port and the one or more processors, wherein the second memory block is configured to store configuration data received via the input port, the configuration data configured to update the ML processor, and wherein the second memory block is only writeable via the input port and only readable via the one or more processors.
5. The data-secure system of claim 1 further comprising: a data monitoring processor coupled to the I/O port and configured to: detect sensor data passing through the I/O port; and take remedial action in response to detecting the sensor data passing through the I/O port.
6. The data-secure system of claim 5 wherein the remedial action includes at least one of: initiating an alert; ceasing all data traffic into and out of the I/O port for a predetermined time; requesting secure authorization; restoring a preset firmware configuration to a trusted environment; or shutting down the data-secure camera system.
7. The data-secure system of claim 1 wherein the one or more processors, the I/O port, and the I/O choke are contained on a single integrated circuit.
8. A non-transitory computer-program product tangibly embodied in a machine-readable non-transitory storage medium that includes instructions configured to cause one or more processors of a data-secure system to: receive and analyze sensor data corresponding to a physical area; generate descriptive data based on the sensor data that includes information that describes content captured by the sensor data specifically about identified objects or activity in the physical area, wherein the descriptive data is different than the sensor data; receive a request for information corresponding to the physical area; send the descriptive data to an I/O port in response to receiving the request; and prevent the sensor data from being accessible via any external communication port of the data-secure system, including the I/O port.
9. The computer-program product of claim 8 wherein the instructions are further configured to cause the one or more processors of the data-secure system to: monitor the I/O port for data traffic containing structured image data or video data; and take a remedial action upon detecting data traffic having structured image data or video data.
10. The computer-program product of claim 8 wherein the request is a user-initiated inquiry about the identified objects or activity in the physical area.
11. The computer-program product of claim 8 wherein the data-secure system is integrated on a single integrated circuit.
12. The computer-program product of claim 11 wherein the data-secure system includes a memory block configured to store the sensor data and descriptive data, wherein the memory block is inaccessible via any externally accessible electrical contact on the integrated circuit including the I/O port.
13. The computer-program product of claim 12 wherein only the one or more processors have read and write access to the memory block.
14. The computer-program product of claim 12 wherein the one or more processors includes a machine learning (ML) processor configured to generate the descriptive data, wherein the data-secure system further includes: an input port; and a second memory block communicatively coupled between input port and the one or more processors, wherein the second memory block is configured to store configuration data received via the input port, the configuration data configured to update the ML processor, wherein the second memory block is only writeable via the input port and only readable via the one or more processors.
15. The computer-program product of claim 8 wherein the one or more processors includes a processor configured external to the I/O port, the processor including machine learning capabilities and configured to: analyze data traffic passing through the I/O port; perform data-type classification of the data traffic; and take a remedial action upon detecting data traffic containing data corresponding to an unauthorized data-type classification.
16. The computer-program product of claim 15 wherein the data-type classification includes an image data classification, video data classification, audio data classification, or text-data classification.
