<title>
Executable action modification
</title>

<abstract>
A method for improving an action implementation process is provided. The method includes detecting a cancelation or a rescheduling for an originally planned activity of a user to be performed during a first time period. An alternative activity for replacement of the originally planned activity is determined. It is determined that a second time period necessary for performing the alternative activity exceeds the first time period and in response, an executable action is generated. The executable action is configured to be combined with the alternative activity such that the alternative activity may be accommodated. Machine learning software code is executed top determine if the user would be likely to accept the alternative activity if the additional executable action exceeds a specified threshold. In response, the executable action is automatically executed in real time thereby enabling the alternative activity.

<claims>
1. An action implementation improvement method comprising: detecting, by a processor of a hardware device via a plurality of hardware sensors, a cancelation or a rescheduling event for an originally planned activity of a user to be performed during a first time period; automatically applying, by said processor, user preferences of said user with respect to preferred activities of said user in order to automatically select an optimal notification time to allow sufficient time for the completion of said preferred activities; detecting, by said processor via a GPS sensor of said plurality of hardware sensors, a location of said user; detecting, by said processor via an activity tracking sensor and a heart rate monitor of said plurality of hardware sensors, an activity currently performed by said user; detecting, by said processor via a social network code based sensor of said plurality of hardware sensors, social network activity of said user; identifying, by said processor, a vacation schedule of said user; detecting, by said processor, a free time period for said user; first determining, by said processor based on said originally planned activity, said preferred activities, said location, said activity detected via said activity tracking sensor and said heart rate monitor, said vacation schedule, said free time period, and said social network activity, an alternative activity for replacement of said originally planned activity during said first time period; second determining, by said processor, that a second time period necessary for performing said alternative activity exceeds said first time period; automatically adjusting, by said processor based on said alternate activity, a route of travel of said user with respect to an activity tracker; third determining, by said processor, an executable hardware modification action, associated with resetting an alarm system, for combining with said alternative activity enabling said alternative activity to be accommodated; activating, by said processor, a wearable device for initializing said alarm system; automatically executing in real time, by said processor in response to said activating, said executable hardware modification action comprising providing a control signal to said alarm system; activating, by said processor in response to said control signal, electrical circuitry of said alarm system; resetting, by said processor in response to said activating said electrical circuitry, functionality of said alarm system; presenting, by said processor to said user via said alarm system, an alarm signal thereby enabling said alternative activity to enable said user to proceed to perform said alternative activity.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein said executable action comprises controlling specified hardware for implementing said alternative activity.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein said executable action comprises controlling specified software for implementing said alternative activity.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving, by said processor, feedback data associated with said executable action; and updating, by said processor, machine learning software code based on said feedback data.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein said cancelation or said rescheduling event is retrieved from said plurality of hardware sensors selected from the group consisting of GPS sensors, activity tracking sensors, and social network code based sensors.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein said executable action comprises notifying said user of said executable action combined with said alternative activity.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: additionally determining, by said processor based on analyses of user based data and execution of machine learning software code, if said user would be likely to accept said alternative activity if said additional executable action exceeds a specified threshold.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: providing at least one support service for at least one of creating, integrating, hosting, maintaining, and deploying computer-readable code in the control hardware, said code being executed by the computer processor to implement: said detecting, said first determining, said second determining, said third determining, said additionally determining, and said automatically executing in real time.
