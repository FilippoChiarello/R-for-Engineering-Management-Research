METHODS FOR REGISTERING DATA FROM AN INDIVIDUAL'S IDENTITY DOCUMENT AND FOR AUTHENTICATING AN IDENTITY DOCUMENT
</title>

<abstract>
The invention also relates to an authentication method and a server for this purpose.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of registering data from an individual's identity document (1), the method being characterized in that it comprises implementing by a server (2) data processing means (21), the following steps: (A) Receipt of a photograph of said individual visible on said identity document (1), an optical reading data element of the identity document (1), and at least one personal data element of said individual; (B) Extraction by analysis of said photograph of a reference information representative of the appearance of said photograph; (C) Generation of a random string, calculation of an encoded data element by applying an encoding procedure to said reference information representative of the appearance of said photograph and said random string; (D) Storage on the server (2) data storage means (22) of: Said encoded data element; A cryptographic imprint of a first concatenation of the optical reading data element of the identity document (1) and the random string; An encryption with a cryptographic imprint of a second concatenation of the optical reading data element of the identity document (1) and the random string, different from the first concatenation, of at least one personal data element of said individual.
2. A method according to claim 1, wherein the encoding procedure is a sketching procedure of a secure sketch algorithm.
3. A method according to claim 1, wherein the optical reading data element of the identity document (1) is a data of the MRZ, QR code or PDF417 type.
4. A method according to claim 1, wherein said personal data element of said individual is an alphanumeric data element associated with said individual, said photograph of the individual, said optical reading data element, and at least one alphanumeric data element are printed on the identity document (1).
5. A method according to claim 1, wherein the reference information representative of an expected appearance of said photograph is a Digital Photo Seal security data element.
6. A method according to claim 1, wherein the first and second concatenation correspond to the two possible directions of concatenation of the optical reading data element of the identity document (1) and the random string.
7. A method for authenticating an identity document (1), characterized in that it comprises the implementation of the following steps: (b) Receipt by a server (2) data processing means (21) of an acquired image of said identity document (1), the image representing at least a photograph of an individual and an optical reading data element visible on said identity document (1); (c) Extraction, by analysis of said acquired image by the server (2) data processing means (21), of: candidate information representative of the appearance of said photograph as represented in the acquired image; said optical reading data element as represented in the acquired image; (d) Calculation of a decoded data element corresponding to a random string by applying a decoding procedure to said candidate information representative of the appearance of said photograph and to an encoded data element stored on the server (2) data storage means (22); (e) Verification that a cryptographic imprint of a first concatenation of the extracted optical reading data element and the decoded data element matches the cryptographic imprint of the first concatenation of the optical reading data element of the identity document (1) and the random string stored on the server (2) data storage means (22); (f) Decrypting at least one personal data element of said encrypted individual stored on the server (2) data storage means (22), by means of the cryptographic imprint of a second concatenation of the extracted optical reading data element and the decoded data element.
8. A method according to claim 7, comprising a step (a) of pre-acquisition of said image of said identity document (1) representing at least a photograph of an individual and an optical reading data element visible on said identity document (1) by optical acquisition means (30) of a client equipment (3).
9. An authentication server (2), characterized in that it comprises the data storage means (22) and the data processing means (21) configured to: Receive a photograph of said individual visible on said identity document (1), an optical reading data element of the identity document (1), and at least one personal data element of said individual; Extract by analysis from said photograph reference information representative of the appearance of said photograph; Generate a random string, and calculate an encoded data element by applying an encoding procedure to said reference information representative of the appearance of said photograph and said random string; Store on the data storage means (22): Said encoded data element; A cryptographic imprint of a first concatenation of the optical reading data element of the identity document (1) and the random string; An encryption with a cryptographic imprint of a second concatenation of the optical reading data element of the identity document (1) and the random string, different from the first concatenation, of at least one personal data element of said individual.
10. A server according to claim 9, wherein the data processing means (21) are further configured to: Receive an acquired image of an identity document (1), the image representing at least a photograph of an individual and an optical reading data element visible on said identity document (1); extract, by analysis of said acquired image: candidate information representative of the appearance of said photograph as represented in the acquired image; said optical reading data element as represented in the acquired image; Calculate a decoded data element corresponding to a random string by applying a decoding procedure to said candidate information representative of the appearance of said photograph and to an encoded data element stored on the data storage means (22); Verify that a cryptographic imprint of a first concatenation of the extracted optical reading data element and the decoded data element matches the cryptographic imprint of the first concatenation of the optical reading data element of the identity document (1) and the random string stored on the data storage means (22); Decipher at least one personal data element of said encrypted individual stored on the data storage means (22), by means of the cryptographic imprint of a second concatenation of the extracted optical reading data element and the decoded data element.
