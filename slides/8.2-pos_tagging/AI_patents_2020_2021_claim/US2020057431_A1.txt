AUTONOMOUS MOBILE ROBOTS FOR MOVABLE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS
</title>

<abstract>
A system for performing autonomous agriculture within an agriculture production environment includes one or more agriculture pods, a stationary robot system, and one or more mobile robots. The agriculture pods include one or more plants and one or more sensor modules for monitoring the plants. The stationary robot system collects sensor data from the sensor modules, performs farming operations on the plants according to an operation schedule based on the collected sensor data, and generates a set of instruction for transporting the agriculture pods within the agriculture production environment. The stationary robot system communicates the set of instructions to the agriculture pods. The mobile robots transport the agriculture pods between the stationary robot system and one or more other locations within the agriculture production environment according to the set of instructions.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A system for performing autonomous agriculture within an agriculture production environment, the system comprising: one or more agriculture pods comprising (a) one or more plants and (b) one or more sensor modules for monitoring the plants; a stationary robot system configured to: collect sensor data from the sensor modules, perform one or more farming operations on the plants according to an operation schedule based on the collected sensor data, generate a set of instructions for transporting the agriculture pods within the agriculture production environment, and communicate the set of instructions to the agriculture pods; and one or more mobile robots configured to transport the agriculture pods between the stationary robot system and one or more other locations within the agriculture production environment according to the set of instructions.
2. The system of claim 1, further comprising: a software application executing remotely from the agriculture production environment and configured to: collect the sensor data from the stationary robot system, and present the sensor data to one or more users, and update the operation schedule based on one or more commands received from the users.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein each sensor module comprises a temperature sensor, a moisture sensor, and a light sensor.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the sensor module further comprises an ion-selective sensor.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein each sensor module further comprises a wireless networking antenna for communicating with the stationary robot system.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein each agriculture pod further comprises a plant tower holding the plants according to a particular growth geometry and a riser elevating the plant tower off the ground.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the particular growth geometry is a spiral geometry.
8. The system of claim 6, wherein the particular growth geometry is a pyramid geometry.
9. The system of claim 6, wherein the particular growth geometry is a cylinder geometry.
10. The system of claim 6, wherein the mobile robot transports the agriculture pod by (a) moving under the riser, (b) increasing the height of the mobile robot until the riser is not in contact with the ground, (c) transporting the agriculture pod to a desired location within the agriculture production environment, and (d) decreasing the height of the mobile robot until the riser is in contact with the ground at the desired location.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the farming operations comprise one or more of seeding, watering, harvesting, or monitoring the plants.
12. The system of claim 1, wherein the mobile robot locally executes a route planning algorithm to determine routes for moving within the agriculture production environment based on the second set of instructions.
13. The system of claim 1, wherein the stationary robot system comprises one or more robot arms for manipulating the plants in the agriculture pods to perform the farming operations.
14. The system of claim 1, wherein the stationary robot system comprises one or more cameras for capturing images of the plants in the agriculture pods.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the images are communicated to one or more remote software applications for display to a user.
16. A method for performing autonomous agriculture within an agriculture production environment, the method comprising: detecting an agriculture pod within a stationary robot system, wherein the agriculture pod comprises (a) one or more plants and (b) one or more sensor modules for monitoring the plants; collecting, by the stationary robot system, sensor data from the sensor modules; performing, by the stationary robot system one or more, farming operations on the plants according to an operation schedule based on the collected sensor data; communicating, by the stationary robot system, one or more instructions to a mobile robot instructing the robot to move the agriculture pod from the stationary robot system to another location within the agriculture production environment.
17. The method of claim 16, further comprising: communicating, by the stationary robot system, the collected sensor data to a remote software application; and in response to communicating the sensor data, receiving updates to the operation schedule.
18. The method of claim 16, further comprising: receiving, by the stationary robot system, weather forecast data; updating one or more of the operation schedule or the instructions communicated to the mobile robot based on the weather forecast data.
19. The method of claim 16, further comprising: capturing, by the stationary robot system, one or more images of the plants while executing the operation schedule; and communicating, by the stationary robot system, the images to a remote software application.
20. A method for performing autonomous agriculture within an agriculture production environment using a software application, the method comprising: creating an operation schedule based on one or more user inputs; communicating the operation schedule to a stationary robot system within the agriculture product environment; receiving sensor data collected by the stationary robot system from one or more agriculture pods during execution of the operation schedule, wherein each agriculture pod comprises one or more plants; receiving images of the plants collected by stationary robot system during execution of the operation schedule; and displaying one or more of the sensor data and the images to a user in the software application.
