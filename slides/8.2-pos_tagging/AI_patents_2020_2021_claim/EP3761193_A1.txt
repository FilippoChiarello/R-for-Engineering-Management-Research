SAFETY ANALYSIS OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS COMPRISING HUMAN OBJECTS
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method (10) is provided for safety analysis of a technical system comprising a human object. The method comprises: determining (101) a system model (20) of the technical system comprising the human object; determining (102) at least one use case (201) of the technical system in accordance with a human interaction of the human object with the technical system; and simulating (103) the technical system in accordance with the system model (20) and the at least one use case (201). The simulating (103) of the technical system comprises tracking (1034) of safety hazard events in relation to the human interaction.
