IMAGE PROCESSING DEVICE, IMAGE PROCESSING METHOD, AND RECORDING MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
An image processing device includes: a solid object extraction unit that divides each of a plurality of captured images into a foreground image part occupied by an existent object and a background image part; a background complementing unit that complements each background image part; a background image synthesis unit that generates a background bird's eye synthetic image by performing bird's eye transformation and combining together the background image parts after undergoing the bird's eye transformation; a solid object recognition unit that acquires posture information on the existent object; a solid object projection unit that acquires a three-dimensional virtual object by using the posture information; a three-dimensional space superimposition unit that generates a three-dimensional space image by superimposing the three-dimensional, virtual object on the background bird's eye synthetic image; and a display image output unit that outputs a bird's eye synthetic image generated based on the three-dimensional space image.
