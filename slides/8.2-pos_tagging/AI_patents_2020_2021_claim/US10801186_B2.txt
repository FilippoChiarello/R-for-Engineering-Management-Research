<title>
Integrated system and method to determine activity of excavation machinery
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for monitoring and alerting of a working equipment proximity to a utility system. The invention provides a device on the working equipment with sensors and GPS location capabilities to determine location and/or movement event data of the equipment. The invention further includes the establishment of an imaginary buffer boundary established around the utility components to use in combination with the event data to provide a reference for alerts to be triggered. Alerts are automatically provided by the system and method at the working equipment and/or a remote operator dashboard.

<claims>
1. An equipment-mounted device comprising a processor and a recordable medium including encoded instructions for collecting and forwarding event data to a processing application that characterizes activity of the equipment and utilizes spatial location information and compares physical movements of equipment with a pre-established buffered boundary at a predetermined distance from or about a physical location of one or more components of a utility system; and further comprising an alarm module adapted to issue an alarm sound or message to an equipment operator as the equipment approaches or contacts the buffered boundary.
2. The device of claim 1, further comprising an equipment-mounted satellite navigation receiver providing the spatial location data as a portion of the event data.
3. The device of claim 1, further comprising a sensor system including at least one equipment-mounted motion sensor, wherein the event data includes motion data from the motion sensor.
4. The device of claim 3, further comprising a nine degree of freedom motion sensor.
5. The device of claim 1, wherein the equipment comprises excavation equipment, agricultural equipment, or construction equipment, and the activity is a ground moving activity.
6. The device of claim 1, further comprising automatically processing the event data in real-time to identify and alert for predicted or potential damage to the utility system.
7. The device of claim 1, wherein the buffered boundary overlays map data and the processing application automatically determines a distance of the physical movements of the equipment from the buffered boundary.
8. The device of claim 1, wherein the buffered boundary comprises a dynamic spatial buffered boundary that is dynamically adjusted as a function of the sensor data and spatial location data as a function of a known information accuracy for the spatial location information of the utility system.
9. A system for monitoring and alerting working equipment movement near utility systems, the system comprising: a sensor system including at least one motion sensor mounted to the working equipment; a satellite navigation receiver mounted to the working equipment; and a computing module in combination with the sensor system and the satellite navigation receiver, the computing module including a processor and a recordable medium including encoded instructions for establishing a predetermined buffered boundary around one or more known components of a utility system, collecting sensor data and spatial location data, characterizing an activity of the working equipment, and comparing, as a function of the spatial location information, physical movements of the equipment with the predetermined buffered boundary established around one or more components of the utility system; and an alarm module adapted to issue an alarm sound or message to an operator of the working equipment as the working equipment approaches or contacts the buffered boundary.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the computing module automatically determines a proximity of the working equipment to the buffered boundary as a function of the spatial location data from the satellite navigation receiver and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data.
11. The system of claim 9, wherein the computing module automatically determines a working motion of the working equipment from motion data determined by the at least one motion sensor and compares the working motion to the buffered boundary.
12. The system of claim 11, further comprising: a nine degree of freedom motion sensor; and a housing mounted on the working equipment and at least partially enclosing the motion sensor, the satellite navigation receiver, and the computing module.
13. The system of claim 9, wherein the buffered boundary comprises an imaginary boundary established at predetermined distance from or about the one or more components of the utility system.
14. The system of claim 9, further comprising automatically processing the sensor data and spatial location data in real-time to identify and alert to possible damage to the utility system.
15. The system of claim 9, wherein the computing module automatically determines a distance of the physical movements of the equipment from the buffered boundary.
16. The system of claim 9, further comprising a communication module adapted to wirelessly communicate to a remote electronic device a proximity of the working equipment to the buffered boundary.
17. The system of claim 9, further comprising encoded instructions for applying a time-based sliding window to the sensor data and spatial location data to characterize the activity and/or position of the working equipment.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein applying the time-based sliding window comprises extracting or determining data features from the data for each sliding window, the features selected from standard deviation, energy, correlation, median, mean, a maximum, and/or a minimum, and comparing the extracted or determined data features for a first sliding window data sampling to a second sliding window data sampling to characterize the activity and/or position of the working equipment.
19. The system of claim 9, further comprising encoded instructions for dynamically adjusting the buffered boundary as a function of the sensor data and spatial location data.
