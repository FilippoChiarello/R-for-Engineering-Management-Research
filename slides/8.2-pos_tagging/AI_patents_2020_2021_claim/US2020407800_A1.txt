NOVEL GENE CLASSIFIERS AND USES THEREOF IN NON-MELANOMA SKIN CANCERS
</title>

<abstract>
Described herein are methods, systems, and compositions for non-invasively diagnosing or detecting a skin disease or disorder. Diagnosing or detecting a non-melanoma skin cancer as provided herein comprises detecting gene expression levels of a set of identified genes and in some instances further detecting mutations in a gene of interest.

1. 1.-20. (canceled)
21. A method for non-invasively identifying a non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in a subject suspected of having NMSC, the NMSC being basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the method comprising: (a) isolating nucleic acids from a skin sample adhered to an adhesive patch, the skin sample having been obtained from the subject suspected of having the NMSC; (b) contacting the isolated nucleic acids with a set of probes that recognize one or more genes of interest implicated in BCC or SCC; and (c) detecting or measuring an amount of binding between the one or more genes of interest and the set of probes.
22. The method of claim 21, further comprising repeating steps (a)-(c) for a plurality of skin samples.
23. The method of claim 22, further comprising differentiating skin samples having been obtained from the subject suspected of having the NMSC from non-cancer skin samples.
24. The method of claim 23, wherein differentiating comprises generating a plurality of pair-wise interactions between at least two genes of interest in the skin sample.
25. The method of claim 24, further comprising analyzing the plurality of pair-wise interactions to determine an area under a curve (AUC) value for each of the plurality of pair-wise interactions.
26. The method of claim 25, further comprising differentiating the skin sample in the subject suspected of having NMSC from a non-cancer samples when an AUC value is greater than about 0.9.
27. The method of claim 21, wherein the method differentiates primary cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples from benign and precursor lesions such as actinic keratosis (AK), seborrheic keratosis (SK).
28. The method of claim 27, wherein differentiation has a sensitivity of at least about 90% and a specificity of at least about 70%.
29. The method of claim 21, wherein the method further comprises providing information regarding one or more of: identification of the disease state, determining likelihood of treatment success for the given disease state, identification of progression of the disease state, or identification of the disease stage.
30. The method of claim 21, wherein the skin sample is from the stratum corneum layer of the subject's skin.
31. The method of claim 21, wherein the skin sample comprises keratinocytes, melanocytes, basal cells, T-cells, or dendritic cells.
32. The method of claim 21, further comprising comparing an amount of binding between the genes of interest and the set of probes to a control or threshold amount of binding.
33. The method of claim 32, further comprising identifying the subject as having BCC or SCC, or as not having BCC or SCC, based on the amount of binding between the genes of interest and the set of probes relative to the control or threshold of binding.
34. The method of claim 33, wherein identifying the subject as not having BCC or SCC comprises identifying the subject as having actinic keratosis or seborrheic keratosis.
35. The method of claim 33, further comprising administering an effective amount of a therapeutic agent to the subject identified as having BCC or SCC.
36. The method of claim 21, wherein the one or more genes of interest comprise two or more of IGFL1, MMP1, COL5A2, IL24, AADACL2, PTCH1, CD68, PRKACA, or SPP1.
37. The method of claim 21, further comprising analyzing expression level and mutational changes of the one or more genes of interest.
38. The method of claim 37, wherein the one or more genes of interest are selected from TERT, CDKN2A, TP53, or PTCH1, or a combination thereof.
39. A method for non-invasively identifying a non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) comprising basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), comprising: (a) identifying a subject suspected of having the NMSC; (b) applying an adhesive patch to the subject's skin in a manner sufficient to adhere a skin sample to the adhesive patch; (c) removing the adhesive patch from the subject's skin in a manner sufficient to retain the skin sample adhered to the adhesive patch; and (d) obtaining expression levels of genes of interest implicated in BCC or SCC, or determining an amount of binding between the genes of interest and a set of probes that recognize the genes of interest.
40. A method of treating a subject with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or squamous cell skin cancer (SCC), comprising: (a) identifying a subject suspected of having BCC or SCC; (b) obtaining a skin sample from the subject by applying the adhesive patch to the subject's skin in a manner sufficient to adhere the skin sample to the adhesive patch; (c) removing the adhesive patch from the subject's skin in a manner sufficient to retain the skin sample adhered to the adhesive patch; (d) isolating nucleic acids from the skin sample; (e) contacting the isolated nucleic acids with a set of probes that recognize one or more genes of interest implicated in BCC or SCC; (f) detecting or measuring the amount of binding between the genes of interest and the set of probes; (g) identifying the subject as having BCC or SCC, or as not having BCC or SCC, based on the amount of binding between the genes of interest and the set of probes; and (h) administering a treatment for the BCC or SCC based on the determination of whether the subject has BCC or SCC.
