<title>
Automatic anesthesiology pump allowing improved anesthesiologist mobility
</title>

<abstract>
An anesthesiology pump for automatic delivery and control of anesthetics to a patient provides a remote unit that may be carried by an anesthesiologist to improve supervision of the anesthesiology process without unnecessarily constraining the anesthesiologist's movement. The anesthesiology pump may assess one or both of a status of the anesthesiology procedure and the availability of the anesthesiologist to provide tailored alerts to the anesthesiologist when additional attention or availability may be needed. Availability may consider separation distance between the pump and the radiologist as well as express indications of availability. A set of predefined safe states permit a pump response when the anesthesiologist is not available and additional attention is required.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A system for automatic delivery of general anesthetics based on patient monitoring comprising: at least two independent pump units each including a processor executing a program stored in memory to receive physiological signals selected from a group consisting of blood oxygen, respiration rate, heart rate and brain waves from a corresponding patient under anesthesia and to provide a controlled delivery of drugs providing a reduced level of consciousness to the patient in an anesthesiology procedure in response to the received physiological signals, each independent pump unit further assessing a confidence interval assessing a degree to which the controlled delivery of drugs represents a normal anesthesiology session; and a mobile unit communicating wirelessly with the at least two pump units concurrently to provide real time information to a remote anesthesiologist indicating a status of each anesthesiology procedure based on the received physiological signals and to provide information to the remote anesthesiologist associating the status with the patient and to provide alerts to the remote anesthesiologist indicating that immediate attention should be given to the patient based on the received physiological signals; wherein each independent pump unit further assesses an availability of the anesthesiologist based on communication with the mobile unit; and wherein the alerts to the remote anesthesiologist are dependent on a combination of both assessed availability and assessed confidence interval so that an alert is first provided (i) when the anesthesiologist is at a first distance when there is low confidence and (ii) when the anesthesiologist is at a second distance when there is high confidence, so that a decreased confidence interval triggers an alert at closer distances and an increased confidence interval triggers an alert at farther distances, where the anesthesiologist is closer to the pump unit at the first distance than at the second distance; wherein the confidence interval is independent of the availability of the anesthesiologist.
2. The system of claim 1 wherein the mobile unit is sized and communicates with the pump unit so that it may be carried by the anesthesiologist.
3. The system of claim 2 wherein the mobile unit includes a wrist strap for holding on an anesthesiologist's arm in a manner of a wristwatch.
4. The system of claim 2 wherein the mobile unit provides a display indicating values of at least two physiological signals.
5. The system of claim 4 wherein the mobile unit provides a display indicating a qualitative status of the anesthesiology procedure.
6. The system of claim 5 wherein the qualitative status is indicated by a color of an icon representing the pump unit.
7. The system of claim 5 wherein the pump unit further provides signals to the mobile unit generating alerts selected from a group of visual, audible, or tactile alerts due to a change in the confidence interval.
8. The system of claim 7 wherein the mobile unit provides a display indicating a current confidence interval.
9. The system of claim 8 wherein the confidence interval is indicated by a color of an icon representing the pump unit.
10. The system of claim 1 wherein the pump unit determines availability of the anesthesiologist at least in part by an assessed distance between the pump unit and the anesthesiologist.
11. The system of claim 10 wherein the assessed distance is determined using wireless signals from the pump unit and mobile unit.
12. The system of claim 10 wherein the pump unit determines availability of the anesthesiologist at least in part by a self-reporting of availability by the anesthesiologist.
13. The system of claim 12 wherein the pump unit determines availability of the anesthesiologist at least in part by interaction by the anesthesiologist and the remote device for reviewing data on the remote device.
14. The system of claim 1 wherein the pump unit provides internal diagnostics for operation of the pump unit and wherein the alerts are also a function of an indication of failure of the pump unit.
15. The system of claim 14 wherein the failure is selected from a group consisting of failure of desired flow rate of anesthesia and failure of processor or memory.
16. The system of claim 1 wherein the processor executing the program stored in memory provides the controlled delivery of anesthesia to the patient by applying the physiological signals according to clinical rules.
17. The system of claim 16 wherein the clinical rules are stored in the memory and further including a communication channel for upgrading the clinical rules stored in the memory.
18. The system of claim 16 wherein the clinical rules are obtained in real-time.
