<title>
Predicting contract details using an unstructured data source
</title>

<abstract>
A method may include extracting first entities from a first portion of an unstructured data source associated with a user, obtaining, based on the first entities, a contract model including elements and a contract type, generating, by applying the contract model to the first entities, a proposed contract including a contract score and, for each element, element values. Each element value may include an element value score. The method may further include identifying a structured data source associated with the user, obtaining, from the structured data source, structured data corresponding to the first entities, correlating the structured data with an element value of the proposed contract, and modifying, by applying the contract model to the structured data, the element value score of the element value.

2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: extracting, from a second portion of the unstructured data source, a second set of entities corresponding to the first set of entities; and modifying, by applying the contract model to the second set of entities and the structured data, the element value score of the first element value.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: obtaining, from a position of a slider of the GUI, a weighting factor associated with the structured data source, wherein the position is set by the user, wherein modifying the first element value score is based on the weighting factor.
