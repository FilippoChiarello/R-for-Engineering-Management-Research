LEARNING RESULT OUTPUT APPARATUS AND LEARNING RESULT OUTPUT PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
A learning result output apparatus includes a machine learning unit that performs machine learning on at least one of attributes of a learning target, with a degree of the attribute as an evaluation axis, on the basis of morphological information indicating a shape of the learning target, and a graph information generation unit that generates graph information indicating a graph representing a learning result obtained by performing machine learning in the machine learning unit, with the evaluation axis as an axis, on the basis of a learning model indicating the learning result.

<claims>
1. A learning result output apparatus, comprising: a machine learning unit that performs machine learning on at least one of attributes of a learning target, using the degree of an attribute as an evaluation axis, on the basis of morphological information indicating shape of the learning target; and a graph information generation unit that generates graph information indicating a graph representing a learning result obtained by performing machine learning in the machine learning unit, with the evaluation axis as an axis, on the basis of a learning model indicating the learning result.
2. The learning result output apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: an operation detection unit that detects an operation of selecting the evaluation axis based on the learning model, wherein the graph information generation unit generates the graph information using the evaluation axis selected by the operation detected by the operation detection unit as an axis.
3. The learning result output apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the operation detection unit further detects a visualization operation of the learning target based on the graph information generated by the graph information generation unit.
4. The learning result output apparatus according to claim 3, further comprising: a control signal generation unit that generates a control signal that is used for sorting of the learning target on the basis of the visualization operation detected by the operation detection unit.
5. The learning result output apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the morphological information is a time-series signal of an optical signal indicating the learning target detected by one or a few pixel detection elements while changing a relative position between the learning target and any one of an optical system having a structured illumination pattern and a structured detection system having a plurality of regions having different optical characteristics, using any one or both of the optical system and the detection system.
6. A learning result output program for causing a computer to execute: a machine learning step of performing machine learning on at least one of attributes of a learning target, with the degree of an attribute as an evaluation axis, on the basis of morphological information indicating a shape of the learning target; and a graph information generation step of generating graph information indicating a graph representing a learning result obtained by performing machine learning in the machine learning step, with the evaluation axis as an axis, on the basis of a learning model indicating the learning result.
