METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR MODULATION OF DYSREGULATED PLCG2 PHOSPHORYLATION
</title>

<abstract>
Among the various aspects of the present disclosure is the provision of methods and compositions for treating a PLCG2 hypophosphorylation-associated disease, disorder, or condition (e.g., juvenile dermatomyositis or recurrent herpesvirus) by administering cytokines, such as IL-2 or IL-15. Also provided herein are methods of modulating natural killer (NK) cell function, such as NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity or calcium flux.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of restoring normal function and normal calcium flux in a dysfunctional natural killer (NK) cell comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a PLCG2 phosphorylation modulating agent comprising a cytokine to the dysfunctional NK cell, wherein the dysfunctional NK cell is from a subject having, suspected of having, or at risk of having a PLCG2 hypophosphorylation-associated disease, disorder, or condition.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the dysfunctional NK cell has dysregulated PLCG2 signaling, PLCG2 haploinsufficiency, or PLCG2 hypophospohorylation.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the PLCG2 hypophosphorylation-associated disease, disorder, or condition is PLCG2 haploinsufficiency (e.g., heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in PLCG2).
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the PLCG2 hypophosphorylation-associated disease, disorder, or condition is an autoimmune disease, an infectious disease, or an inflammatory disease, disorder, or condition (e.g., juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), dermatomyositis (DM)).
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the PLCG2 hypophosphorylation-associated disease, disorder, or condition is a viral infection (e.g., herpesvirus, adenovirus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), cytomegalovirus (CMV)).
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the viral infection is a herpesvirus infection and the herpesvirus infection is an unusually severe or recurrent herpesvirus infection.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the subject has herpesvirus infection susceptibility or bacterial infection susceptibility.
8. The method of claim 1, the dysfunctional NK cell is PLCG2 haploinsufficient and has a herpesvirus infection.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the PLCG2 hypophosphorylation-associated disease, disorder, or condition is an inflammatory condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA)).
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the cytokine is IL-2 or IL-15.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the PLCG2 phosphorylation modulating agent restores normal NK cell function and normal NK cell calcium flux in the dysfunctional NK cell.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein restoring normal function and normal calcium flux, in the dysfunctional NK cell, results in improved cytotoxicity of the dysfunctional NK cell or improved ability of the dysfunctional NK cell to suppress inappropriate adaptive immune responses compared to an untreated dysfunctional NK cell.
13. A method of treating a subject in need thereof, comprising administering a PLCG2 phosphorylation modulating agent comprising a cytokine, wherein the subject has dysfunctional NK cells, wherein the subject has, is suspected of having, or is at risk of having a PLCG2 hypophosphorylation-associated disease, disorder, or condition.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the dysfunctional NK cells have dysregulated PLCG2 signaling, PLCG2 haploinsufficiency, or PLCG2 hypophospohorylation.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein the PLCG2 hypophosphorylation-associated disease, disorder, or condition is PLCG2 haploinsufficiency (e.g., heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in PLCG2).
16. The method of claim 13, wherein the PLCG2 hypophosphorylation-associated disease, disorder, or condition is an autoimmune disease, an infectious disease, or an inflammatory disease, disorder, or condition (e.g., juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), dermatomyositis (DM)).
17. The method of claim 13, wherein the PLCG2 hypophosphorylation-associated disease, disorder, or condition is a viral infection (e.g., herpesvirus, adenovirus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), cytomegalovirus (CMV)).
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the viral infection is a herpesvirus infection and the herpesvirus infection is an unusually severe or recurrent herpesvirus infection.
19. The method of claim 13, wherein the subject has herpesvirus infection susceptibility or bacterial infection susceptibility.
20. The method of claim 13, the dysfunctional NK cells are PLCG2 haploinsufficient and have a herpesvirus infection.
21. The method of claim 13, wherein the PLCG2 hypophosphorylation-associated disease, disorder, or condition is an inflammatory condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA)).
22. The method of claim 13, wherein the cytokine is IL-2 or IL-15.
23. The method of claim 13, wherein the PLCG2 phosphorylation modulating agent restores normal NK cell function and normal NK cell calcium flux in the dysfunctional NK cells.
24. The method of claim 13, wherein restoring normal NK cell function and normal NK cell calcium flux results in improved NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, suppression of inappropriate adaptive immune responses, or reduced autoimmunity in the subject when compared to an untreated subject.
