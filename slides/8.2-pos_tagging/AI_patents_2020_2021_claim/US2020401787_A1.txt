Culture Detection and Measurement Over Time

<abstract>
A computer method for correlating depictions of colonies of microorganisms includes receiving an image of a substrate associated with a first time and showing a colony of microorganisms. A second image of the same substrate and associated with a second time shows a candidate colony of microorganisms. A region of the second image that shows the candidate colony of microorganisms is located. The first region of the first image is compared to the second region of the second image. Based on the comparison of the images, the candidate colony of microorganism is determined to be the same colony as the first colony of microorganisms. Systems for moving substrates having colonies of microorganisms and maintaining orientation of the substrates before and after movement are also described.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method of tracking orientation of a substrate associated with colonies of microorganisms, the method comprising: receiving a first image of the substrate, the first image associated with a first substrate orientation of the substrate with respect to an imaging device; determining, by a processor, a first location and a first fiducial orientation of a fiducial mark associated with the substrate and depicted in the first image; receiving a second image of the substrate, the second image associated with a second substrate orientation of the substrate with respect to the imaging device; determining, by the processor, a second location and a second fiducial orientation of the fiducial mark associated with the substrate and depicted in the second image; determining, by the processor and based at least in part on the first location, the first fiducial orientation, the second location, and the second fiducial orientation, a difference between the first substrate orientation and the second substrate orientation.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising mechanically repositioning or reorienting the substrate with respect to the imaging device based at least in part on the difference between the first substrate orientation and the second substrate orientation.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising altering an orientation of the second image of the substrate based at least in part on the difference between the first orientation and the second orientation to provide a re-oriented image.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the fiducial mark comprises a mark imprinted on or affixed to the substrate.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the fiducial mark comprises a spatial pattern of colonies of microorganisms in the first image.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: mechanically reorienting the substrate with respect to the imaging device based at least in part on the difference between the first substrate orientation and the second substrate orientation so that the substrate has a third substrate orientation with respect to the imaging device; receiving a third image of the substrate associated with the third substrate orientation; determining, by the processor and based at least in part on the first location and the first fiducial orientation, a difference between the third substrate orientation and the first substrate orientation; and altering an orientation of the third image based at least in part on the difference between the third substrate orientation and the first substrate orientation to provide a re-oriented image.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: determining, by the processor, a location of a colony of microorganisms in the first image; determining, by the processor, a location of a candidate colony of microorganisms in the second image; determining, by the processor and based at least in part on the difference between the first substrate orientation and the second substrate orientation, that the candidate colony of microorganisms is a same colony as the colony of microorganisms.
