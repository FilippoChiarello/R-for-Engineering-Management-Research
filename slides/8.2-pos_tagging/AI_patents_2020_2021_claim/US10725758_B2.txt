<title>
Telematics system
</title>

<abstract>
Some embodiments of the invention concern a novel and interactive way to deliver telematics solutions by separating the delivery of the hardware and software component of a telematics device. The software telematics application is selected and delivered to the customer's telematics device by in-application purchases via the customer's mobile device. The mobile device contains a user interface that is adapted to control and configure the telematics device. The customers may upgrade their telematics applications using their mobile devices. A retailer may also request the upgrade of a customer's telematics application using the retailer's mobile device. The user interface also provide a customer profiler tool to provide individualized search results and recommend telematics applications based on the customer's profile.

<claims>
I claim:
1. A telematics device system for vehicles, comprising: an aftermarket telematics device adapted to be installed in a vehicle, said aftermarket telematics device compatible with a plurality of telematics applications; a first user interface installed on a mobile device adapted to communicate with said aftermarket telematic device, said first user interface configurable to be associated with said aftermarket telematics device through a first authentication process; a second user interface adapted to communicate with said aftermarket telematic device, said second user interface configurable to be associated with said aftermarket telematics device through a second authentication process; a data source adapted to store said plurality of telematics applications, communicate with said first and second user interfaces, and authenticate said first and second authentication processes; wherein said data source is adapted to receive user information regarding said aftermarket telematics device from said first user interface including a first-user-requested update for said aftermarket telematics device, said first-user-requested update may be new applications from said plurality of telematics applications; said second user interface is adapted to receive said user information from said data source; said second intermediary user interface is capable of adapted to select a second-user-accepted update from said plurality of telematics applications for said aftermarket telematics device and instruct said data source to transmit said second-user-accepted update to said first user interface on said mobile device; and, said first user interface is adapted to receive said second-user-accepted update and to control and configure said aftermarket telematics device with said second-user-accepted update via said short-ranged protocol after said first and second authentication processes.
2. The telematics device system of claim 1, wherein said aftermarket telematics device can be adapted to different telematics application features.
3. The telematics device system of claim 1, wherein said first user interface is adapted to collect information from a user and, based on the information collected, said first user interface is adapted to generate a profile that recommend telematics applications to said user.
4. The telematics device system of claim 1, wherein said first user interface is adapted to communicate with a third party data source that is associated with a developer application program interface that allows developers to develop telematics applications that are compatible with said aftermarket telematics device.
5. The telematics device system of claim 1, wherein said first user interface is adapted to cause said mobile device to transmit said particular telematics application to said aftermarket telematics device via said short-ranged protocol when said mobile device is in a proximity to said aftermarket telematics device.
6. The telematics device system of claim 1, wherein said authentication process that associates said first user interface with said aftermarket telematics device can only be initiated when said aftermarket telematics device has detected that a door of said vehicle is open and an ignition of said vehicle is turned on.
7. The telematics device system of claim 1, wherein said first user interface is used by an intermediary, after said particular telematics application is delivered, said first user interface is adapted to generate a transaction record that is associated with the intermediary.
