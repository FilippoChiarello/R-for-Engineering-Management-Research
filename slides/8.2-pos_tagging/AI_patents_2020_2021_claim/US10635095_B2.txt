<title>
Computer system and method for creating a supervised failure model
</title>

<abstract>
The example systems, methods, and devices disclosed herein generally relate to generating create a supervised failure model for assets in the given fleet that is configured to receive operating data as inputs and output a prediction as to the occurrence of a given failure type at the asset. In some instances, a data analytics platform may create and use an unsupervised failure model for a subset of the assets, use the respective unsupervised failure models to detect a set of anomalies that are each suggestive of a prior failure occurrence, from the set of anomalies, identify a subset of anomalies that are each suggest of a prior failure occurrence of the given failure type, and create the supervised failure model using failure data for the identified subset of anomalies.
