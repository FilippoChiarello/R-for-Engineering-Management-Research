DISPLAY APPARATUS AND CONTROL METHOD THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
A display apparatus includes a display, a communicator configured to communicate with a server, and a processor. The processor is configured to control the communicator to transmit graphic data to be displayed on the display to the server, control the communicator to receive from the server video data into which the graphic data is converted, and process and display the received video data on the display.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A display apparatus comprising: a display; a communicator configured to communicate with a server; and a processor configured to: control the communicator to transmit at least a portion of graphic data to be displayed on the display to the server, control the communicator to receive from the server video data into which the at least the portion of the graphic data has been converted by the server, and process and display the received video data on the display.
2. The display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor is further configured to: divide the graphic data into first graphic data and second graphic data, the at least the portion of the graphic data being the first graphic data, control the communicator to transmit the first graphic data to the server, and directly process and display the second graphic data on the display.
3. The display apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the processor is further configured to: obtain synthetized data by synthesizing the received video data with the second graphic data, and display the synthesized data on the display.
4. The display apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the second graphic data is greater in a degree of change in an image or a video than the first graphic data.
5. The display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the received video data comprises the video data converted from the at least the portion of the graphic data after being upscaled in the server.
6. The display apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the processor is further configured to process the second graphic data without converting the second graphic data into video data.
7. The display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the video data obtained by converting the at least the portion of the first graphic data by the server is a first video data, and the processor is further configured to directly process a second video data received via the communicator from an external device, obtain synthesized data by synthesizing the first video data received from the server with the directly processed second video data, and display the synthesized data on the display.
8. The display apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processor comprises a graphics processor configured to directly process and display a partial region of the graphic data, in correspondence with a resolution processible by the graphics processor.
9. The display apparatus according to claim 8, wherein the processor is further configured to control the communicator to transmit, to the server, a remaining graphic data, which is provided for a remaining region other than the partial region, the remaining region corresponding to the at least the portion of the graphic region.
10. The display apparatus according to claim 9, wherein the processor is further configured to: receive the video data, into which the graphic data of the remaining region has been converted, from the server through the communicator, obtain synthesized data by synthesizing the received video data with the graphic data of the partial region directly processed by the graphics processor, and display the synthesized data on the display.
11. A display apparatus comprising: a display; and a processor configured to convert graphic data to be displayed on the display into video data, and process and display the video data on the display.
12. A control method of a display apparatus comprising a display, the control method comprising: transmitting at least a portion of graphic data to be displayed on the display to a server; receiving from the server video data into which the at least the portion of the graphic data has been converted; and processing and displaying the received video data on the display.
13. The control method according to claim 12, further comprising: dividing the graphic data into first graphic data and second graphic data, the at least the portion of the graphic data being the first graphic data; transmitting the first graphic data to the server; and directly processing and displaying the second graphic data on the display.
14. The control method according to claim 13, further comprising: obtaining synthesized data by synthesizing the video data received from the server with the second graphic data; and displaying the synthesized data on the display.
15. The control method according to claim 13, wherein the second graphic data is greater in a degree of change in an image or a video than the first graphic data.
16. The control method according to claim 12, wherein the received video data comprises the video data converted from the at least the portion of the graphic data after being upscaled in the server.
17. The control method according to claim 13, wherein the directly processing and displaying the second graphic data on the display comprises: processing the second graphic data without converting the second graphic data into video data.
18. The control method according to claim 12, wherein the video data obtained by converting the at least the portion of the first graphic data by the server is a first video data, and the control method further comprises: obtaining synthetized data by synthesizing the first video data received from the server with the directly processed second video data; and displaying the synthesized data on the display.
19. The control method according to claim 12, further comprising: directly processing and displaying a partial region of the graphic data, in correspondence with a resolution processible by the display apparatus.
20. The control method according to claim 19, further comprising: transmitting, to the server, a remaining graphic data, which is provided for a remaining region other than the partial region, to be processed by the server, the remaining region corresponding to the at least the portion of the graphic data.
