<title>
AUDIO SIGNAL DEREVERBERATION
</title>

<abstract>
Audio signal dereverberation can be carried out in accordance instructions on a machine readable storage medium, using a processor. In an example, a location of a person in a room can be determined. An audio signal received from the location of the person can be captured using beamforming. Room properties can be determined based in part on a signal sweep of the room. A dereverberation parameter can be determined based in part on the location of the person and the room properties. The dereverberation parameter can be applied to the audio signal.

<claims>
What is Claimed Is:
1 . A machine readable storage medium comprising instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to:
determine a location of a person in a room;
capture an audio signal received from the location of the person using
beamforming;
determine room properties based in part on a signal sweep of the room;
determine a dereverberation parameter based in part on the location of the person and the room properties; and
apply the dereverberation parameter to the audio signal.
2. The machine readable storage medium of claim 1 , wherein the instructions cause the processor to:
apply the dereverberation parameter to the audio signal to reduce reverberation in the audio signal in response to the location of the person satisfying a location criteria; and
transmit the audio signal with reduced reverberation.
3. The machine readable storage medium of claim 1 , wherein the instructions cause the processor to:
provide the location of the person and the room properties to a machine learning model; and
