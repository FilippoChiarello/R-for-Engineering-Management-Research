DRYER FOR HERBACEOUS MATERIAL WITH ACCESS HEATING
</title>

<abstract>
The dryer comprises a dryer receptacle having an inner space for receiving herbaceous material, an access assembly providing access to the inner space of the dryer receptacle, and a heating system comprising at least one access heating element for actively heating the access assembly. The access assembly comprises at least one of an inlet conveyor for supplying herbaceous material into the inner space of the dryer receptacle and an outlet conveyor for removing herbaceous material from the inner space of the dryer receptacle. The at least one access heating element comprises a conveyor heating element incorporated into the conveyor.

<claims>
1 . Dryer for drying herbaceous material, comprising
a dryer receptacle having an inner space for receiving herbaceous material;
an access assembly providing access to the inner space of the dryer receptacle; and a heating system comprising at least one access heating element for actively heating the access assembly,
wherein the access assembly comprises at least one of an inlet conveyor for supplying herbaceous material into the inner space of the dryer receptacle and an outlet conveyor for removing herbaceous material from the inner space of the dryer receptacle, and
wherein the at least one access heating element comprises a conveyor heating element incorporated into the conveyor.
2. Dryer according to claim 1 , wherein the at least one access heating element is incorporated into the access assembly.
3. Dryer according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the access assembly comprises a door provided at the dryer receptacle and the at least one access heating element comprises a door heating element incorporated into the door.
4. Dryer according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the at least one access heating element comprises an electrical resistance heating element or a heating fluid line.
5. Dryer according to any one of the preceding claims, further comprising a temperature sensor configured to determine an access assembly temperature.
6. Dryer according to any one of the preceding claims, further comprising a controller configured to control the at least one access heating element to maintain at least a predetermined minimum access assembly temperature.
7. Dryer according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the heating system further comprises at least one wall heating element being incorporated in a wall of the dryer receptacle.
8. Dryer according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the heating system further comprises a vane heating element for actively heating at least one vane extending from an inner surface of the dryer receptacle into the inner space of the dryer receptacle.
9. Dryer according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein at the least one access heating element comprises a plurality of access heating elements, which are arranged to be independently controlled.
10. Method for drying herbaceous material, comprising
heating herbaceous material received in an inner space of a dryer receptacle,
wherein an inner surface of the dryer receptacle is heated such that the entire inner surface of the dryer receptacle is maintained above a condensation temperature of gases evaporated inside the dryer receptacle during heating of the herbaceous material.
1 1 . Method according to claim 10, further comprising actively heating at least one of an inlet conveyor for supplying herbaceous material into the inner space of the dryer receptacle and an outlet conveyor for removing herbaceous material from the inner space of the dryer receptacle at least above the condensation temperature.
12. Method according to claim 1 1 , wherein actively heating the at least one of the inlet conveyor and the outlet conveyor is done with a conveyor heating element incorporated into the at least one of the inlet conveyor and the outlet conveyor.
13. Method according to any one of claims 10 to 12, further comprising actively heating at least one door of the dryer receptacle.
14. Method according to any one of claims 10 to 13, wherein first and second doors of the dryer receptacle provided at opposing sides of the dryer receptacle are actively heated to different temperatures.
15. Use of an access heating element for actively heating an access assembly providing access to the inner space of a dryer receptacle for receiving herbaceous material to prevent formation of lower temperature spots, wherein the access assembly comprises at least one of an inlet conveyor for supplying herbaceous material into the inner space of the dryer receptacle and an outlet conveyor for removing herbaceous material from the inner space of the dryer receptacle, and wherein the at least one access heating element comprises a conveyor heating element incorporated into the conveyor.
