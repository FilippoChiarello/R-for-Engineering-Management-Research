<title>
Circuitry for one-transistor synapse cell and operation method of the same
</title>

<abstract>
Word lines intersect bit lines at a plurality of cross points where a plurality of single memory transistor synapse cells are located. Each cell includes a memory transistor; a pulse shaping unit coupled to a given one of a plurality of signal lines and a gate of the memory transistor; a logic gate having inputs coupled to a corresponding one of the word lines and a corresponding one of the bit lines, and an output coupled to the pulse shaping unit; and a pass gate arrangement. The latter is coupled to the memory transistor, the corresponding one of the word lines, the corresponding one of the bit lines, and the output of the logic gate. Pulses are applied to the gate of the memory transistor for weight adjustment during update and to interconnect the memory transistor to the corresponding one of the bit lines during inference.
