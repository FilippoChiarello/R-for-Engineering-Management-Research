Submodular Load Clustering with Robust Principal Component Analysis
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods manage electrical loads in a grid by applying Robust principal component analysis (R-PCA) to decompose annual load profiles into low-rank components and sparse components; extracting one or more predetermined features; constructing a similarity graph; selecting submodular cluster centers through the constructed similarity graph; determining a cluster assignment based on selected centers; and applying the clustering assignment for load analysis.

<claims>
1. A method to manage electrical loads in a grid, comprising: applying Robust principal component analysis (R-PCA) to decompose annual load profiles into low-rank components and sparse components; extracting one or more predetermined features; constructing a similarity graph; selecting submodular cluster centers through the constructed similarity graph; determining a cluster assignment based on selected centers; and applying the clustering assignment for load analysis.
2. The method of claim 1, comprising performing data normalization.
3. The method of claim 1, comprising selecting a submodular cluster center and applying the selected submodular cluster center to determine one or more optimal cluster centers through the constructed similarity graph.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the R-PCA is applied to decompose the load time series into low-rank and sparse components to extract key features.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the submodular selection determines cluster centers.
6. The method of claim 1, comprising ranking load areas in order as the center candidates, where higher order indicates higher priority to be chosen as the cluster centers.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein without repeating the whole clustering process, a different total cluster number K simply requires picking K first candidates and re-assigning load profiles.
8. The method of claim 1, comprising determining rank-k component L to minimize an 12-norm of reconstruction errors between original data M and low-rank component, wherein singular value decomposition (SVD) by:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?minimize ∥M−L∥subject to rank(L)≤k description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?
9. The method of claim 1, comprising minimizing a weighted sum of a nuclear-norm of low-rank matrix L and 11-norm of a sparse matrix S, Wherein L is the low-rank component of original data matrix M, S is the sparse component of the original data matrix M, p is the p-th singular values in matrix L, i and j are the i-th row and j-th column in matrix S.
10. The method of claim 1, comprising minimizing a weighted sum of a nuclear-norm of low-rank matrix and L1-norm of sparse matrix, where the nuclear norm computes a sum of singular values of a matrix and the L1-norm enforces sparsity for the matrix.
11. The method of claim 1, comprising extracting a seasonal average load, a seasonal load standard deviation, a seasonal maximum load and seasonal minimum load to form an area load feature set.
12. The method of claim 11, comprising performing feature extraction from the load feature set.
13. The method of claim 1, comprising constructing a similarity graph using a similarity matrix and corresponding element for each load area pair.
14. The method of claim 1, comprising constructing a similarity graph with a similarity matrix W and a corresponding wij for each load area pair; and determining a distance metric with 12-norm and similarity metric with radial basis kernel function (RBF) are computed as dij=∥zi−zj∥2 and where zi and zj are the load features for area i and j, λ controls a similarity scaling.
15. The method of claim 1, comprising selecting a load cluster center by initializing each set element which serves as an upper bound to select new set elements.
16. The method of claim 1, comprising determining K load cluster centers from NI load areas to represent NI load areas.
17. The method of claim 1, comprising determining K load cluster centers from NI load areas to represent NI load areas using: wherein with an original set Ω, a selected set Γ is determined to maximize set-wise similarities between the original set Ω and selected set Γ, subject to a cardinality constraint.
18. The method of claim 1, comprising performing load cluster assignment after obtaining the cluster center rank list or rank set Γ, determining a K-cluster by selecting first K load areas as cluster centers.
19. The method of claim 18, comprising assigning remaining load areas to load area cluster centers with highest pairwise similarity using:
20. A power management system, comprising: a processor to receive electrical loads in a grid; code to manage electrical loads in a grid, comprising instructions to: apply Robust principal component analysis (R-PCA) to decompose annual load profiles into low-rank components and sparse components; extract one or more predetermined features; construct a similarity graph; select submodular cluster centers through the constructed similarity graph; determine a cluster assignment based on selected centers; and apply the clustering assignment for load analysis.
