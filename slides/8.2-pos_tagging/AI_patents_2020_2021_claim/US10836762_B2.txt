<title>
Network-centric sensor coverage management
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments described herein are directed to employing an aggregation of participant sensor coverage areas to determine if there are missing coverage areas or unwanted overlapping coverage areas. If there are missing coverage areas, then at least one participant is instructed to modify its sensor coverage area to at least partially cover the missing coverage area. Conversely, if at least one participant has a sensor that is providing unwanted overlap of other sensor coverage areas, then that participant may be instructed to stop using that sensor, utilize that sensor for other data transmission purposes, or modify the coverage area to be non- or less-overlapping.
