AUTOMATED PLANT TRIMMER
</title>

<abstract>
The automated trimming of an untrimmed plant stem comprises a device for transporting an untrimmed plant stem to an imaging stage, using a camera to capture at least one image of the plant stem, sending the at least one image to a central processor which creates a trim map which constructs a pattern for moving a cutting armature along the plant stem, and trimming the plant stem by cutting structure of the cutting armature to change the untrimmed plant stem to a trimmed plant stem.

<claims>
I claim:
1. An automated device for trimming an untrimmed plant stein comprising: a transport mechanism for holding and moving the plant stem; a camera and an imaging stage; a cutting armature having cutting structure for trimming the plant stem; and a central processor; wherein the transport mechanism moves the plant stem proximate to the imaging stage for image capture; the camera disposed toward the imaging stage to capture at least one image of the plant stem; the central processor receiving the at least one image from the camera to create a trim map using at least some data gathered from the at least one image; and the central processor moving the cutting armature as guided by the trim map to position the cutting structure against the plant stem for trimming the plant stem whereby the untrimmed plant stem is changed to a trimmed plant stem.
2. The device of claim 1 wherein the transport mechanism includes at least one car mounted to a conveyor system, the car having a chuck to releasably hold the plant stem at the imaging stage.
3. The device of claim 2 wherein the chuck is rotatably mounted to hold the plant stem at different orientations, and the rotation of the chuck being driven by a motor receiving signals from the central processor.
4. The device of claim 3 wherein there are a series of cars on the conveyor system, and the chucks are mounted horizontally.
5. The device of claim 3 wherein there are a series of cars on the conveyor system, each car having a chuck and the chucks being vertically mounted, and the imaging station including a vertically mounted backlighted surface.
6. The device of claim 1 wherein the imaging stage includes a backlighted surface to illuminate the plant stem, and reference markers being on the backlighted surface.
7. The device of claim 6 including a support platform mounted on the backlighted surface, and the support platform being made of a transparent/translucent material to permit light to pass through the platform.
8. The device of claim 7 wherein the support platform is slidable toward and away from the cutting structure of the cutting armature, the support platform being spring biased toward an extended position and being movable by the cutting armature to a retracted position upon contact with and movement by the cutting armature, the support platform including a horizontal wall on which the plant stem would be placed, and a vertical fence extending upwardly from the horizontal wall to provide a stop for ensuring that the plant stem remains on the support platform.
9. The device of claim 1 wherein the cutting armature includes a hollow chamber having an elongated generally vertical slit in its outer wall to provide access to the interior of the chamber, the cutting structure being mounted in the hollow chamber, a source of reduced air pressure communicating with the interior of the hollow chamber to draw in plant parts from the plant stem and removing the plant parts when the plant parts are cut from the plant stem, and the hollow chamber having a lower end which slides along the imaging stage and an upper end receiving control signals from the central processor.
10. The device of claim 9 wherein the cutting structure is a laser cutter.
11. The device of claim 9 wherein the cutting structure within the hollow chamber is a rotating blade, a stationary blade being mounted adjacent to the slit, and the slit being axial.
12. The device of claim 9 wherein the hollow chamber is rotatable, and the hollow chamber having a sensor for gathering data about the plant stem.
13. The device of claim 9 wherein the cutting armature is a six axis robotic armature.
14. The device of claim 9 wherein the transport mechanism includes at least one car mounted to a conveyor system, the car having a chuck to releasably hold the plant stem at the imaging stage, the chuck being rotatably mounted to hold the plant stem at different orientations, the rotation of the chuck being driven by a motor receiving signals from the central processor, the imaging stage includes a backlighted surface to illuminate the plant stem, and reference markers being on the backlighted surface.
15. A method for the automated trimming of an untrimmed plant stem comprising transporting an untrimmed plant stem to an imaging stage, using a camera to capture at least one image of the plant stem, sending the at least one image to a central processor which creates a trim map which constructs a pattern for moving a cutting armature along the plant stem, and trimming the plant stem by cutting structure of the cutting armature to change the untrimmed plant stem to a trimmed plant stem.
16. The method of claim 15 wherein the plant stem is transported to the imaging stage by a conveying system having at least one car with a rotatable chuck, and the plant stem being removably mounted in the chuck.
17. The method of claim 16 wherein after the trimming has begun while the plant stem is in one orientation the chuck is rotated to a new orientation and more images are taken at the new orientation.
18. The method of claim 15 wherein the trim map is constructed by a technique selected from the group consisting of shape fitting recognition, pattern recognition, lighting modulation, leaf tip recognition, branch identification and supervised learning.
19. The method of claim 15 wherein the plant stem is placed on the imaging station with the imaging station being in a horizontal position and formed from a backlighted surface to illuminate the plant stem, the plant stem being mounted at the imaging station on a support platform made from a transparent/translucent material which permits light to pass through the platform, the platform being in an extended position disposed toward the cutting armature, and the support platform being movable to a retracted position by the cutting armature pressing against the support platform.
20. The method of claim 15 wherein the imaging stage is a vertically disposed backlighted surface, and the plant stem is mounted in a vertical position.
21. The method of claim 15 wherein the plant stem is cannabis having a flower and plant parts, and the cannabis is trimmed of plant parts leaving the flower on the plant stem.
