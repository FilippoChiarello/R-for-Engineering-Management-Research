<title>
Structurally defining knowledge elements within a cognitive graph
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implementable method for managing a cognitive graph comprising: receiving data from a plurality of data sources; processing the data from the plurality of data sources, the processing the data from the plurality of data sources identifying a plurality of knowledge elements; and, storing the knowledge elements within the cognitive graph as a collection of knowledge elements, the storing universally representing knowledge obtained from the data, each knowledge element being structurally defined within the cognitive graph.

<claims>
1. A computer-implementable method for managing a cognitive graph of a universal knowledge repository comprising: receiving, by a computer, data from a plurality of data sources; processing, by the computer via a cognitive inference and learning system, the data from the plurality of data sources, the processing the data from the plurality of data sources identifying a plurality of knowledge elements as complexity of modeling quantity in an universal cognitive graph of the universal knowledge repository, the cognitive inference and learning system comprising a cognitive platform, the cognitive platform comprising the universal cognitive graph and a cognitive engine, the cognitive engine comprising: a dataset engine, a graph query engine and an insight/learning engine, the dataset engine being implemented to establish and maintain a dynamic data ingestion and enrichment pipeline, the graph query engine being implemented to receive and process queries so that the queries are bridged into the universal cognitive graph, the insight/learning engine being implemented to generate a cognitive insight from the universal cognitive graph, the universal cognitive graph includes one or more user profiles and an integrated machine learning functionality having cognitive functionality which uses extracted features of newly-observed data from user feedback received via an Application Program Interface during a learn phase to improve accuracy of the knowledge elements stored within the universal cognitive graph, the learn phase includes user feedback on observations generated during a relate phase, the universal cognitive graph refers to a representation of expert knowledge associated with groups over a period of time to depict relationships between entities; storing, by the computer, the knowledge elements within the universal cognitive graph as a collection of the knowledge elements, the storing universally representing knowledge obtained from the data, each knowledge element of the knowledge elements being structurally defined within the universal cognitive graph, wherein the collection of knowledge elements is accurately and precisely modeled via a ladder entailment pattern and a diamond entailment pattern, the ladder entailment pattern comprising a pattern formed in the universal cognitive graph where rungs of the ladder entailment pattern are formed by a first set of nodes having a categorical relationship with a corresponding second set of nodes and rails of the ladder entailment pattern are formed by attributive relationships respectively associated with the first and second set of nodes, wherein the nodes are the entities, and wherein the structurally defining said each knowledge element being implemented with an ontology, the ontology universally representing knowledge and comprising a representation of the entities along with properties and relations of the entities according to a system of categories, the ontology storing a knowledge element within the universal cognitive graph based upon a set of the categories of the knowledge element and a set of attributes of the knowledge element; receiving, by the computer from a user via a network, a user query that includes text of the data to generate a graph query; performing, by the computer based on mapper rule set, mapping operations on the user query; parsing, by the computer based on using parsing operations or parse rule set, the user query to identify ambiguities of the text after the performing mapping operations, wherein a parsing operation of the parsing operations comprises lossless parsing operations in which all parse variations are identified using a minimum basic structure that is known true, wherein the using of the parse rule set in the performance of the parsing operations results in generation of a set of parse trees, wherein each parse tree of the parse trees is represented as the text being parsed; ranking, by the computer based on parse ranking rule set, the parse trees which results in determination of top-ranked parse trees to resolve the ambiguities in the text of the query, wherein the parse trees are transformed to a tree representing an interpretation of ambiguous portions of the data, the interpretation of the ambiguous portions of the data is changed based upon the user feedback, the top-ranked parse trees are stored in the universal knowledge repository; identifying, by the computer, knowledge elements of the parse trees that are represented ambiguous portions of the text, wherein the identified knowledge elements of the parse trees are stored within the universal cognitive graph in a configuration representing relationship of concepts; in response to the user query, querying, by the computer, the universal knowledge repository and using the identified knowledge elements of the parse trees and the identified a plurality of knowledge elements of the universal cognitive graph to produce composite cognitive insights as recommendations that satisfy the graph query; ranking, by the computer based information in insight streams, the composite cognitive insights that are provided in a cognitive insight summary, the information is related to location of the user, the user feedback and a device used by the user; publishing, by the computer, the ranked composite cognitive insights in the cognitive insight summary to the user of cognitive insight data, wherein the ranked composite cognitive insights are related to the one or more cognitive user profiles.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein: a relationship between a first knowledge element and a second knowledge element comprises only one of a categorical relationship and an attributive relationship, the categorical relationship representing inheritance of an entity and the attributive relationship representing attribution of the entity.
3. The method of claim 1, the diamond entailment pattern comprising a pattern formed in the universal cognitive graph when two parent nodes of a first node inherit from a common second node.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein: inheritance relationships between a base node and a parent node define a particular concept within the universal cognitive graph.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein: a plurality of knowledge elements representing quantity concepts are stored within the universal cognitive graph.
