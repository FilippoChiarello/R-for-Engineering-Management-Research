MULTI-MODAL EYE IMAGING WITH SHARED OPTICAL PATH
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the present disclosure provide improved techniques for imaging a subject's retina fundus. Some aspects relate to an imaging apparatus that may be substantially binocular shaped and/or may house multiple imaging devices configured to provide multiple corresponding modes of imaging the subject's retina fundus. Some aspects relate to techniques for imaging a subject's eye using white light, fluorescence, infrared (IR), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and/or other imaging modalities that may be employed by a single imaging apparatus. Some aspects relate to improvements in white light, fluorescence, IR, OCT, and/or other imaging technologies that may be employed alone or in combination with other techniques. Some aspects relate to multi-modal imaging techniques that enable determination of a subject's health status. Imaging apparatuses and techniques described herein provide medical grade retina fundus images and may be produced or conducted at low cost, thus increasing access to medical grade imaging.

<claims>
1. An apparatus for imaging and/or measuring a retina fundus of a subject, the apparatus comprising: a housing; a white light imaging device supported by the housing; and a fluorescence imaging device supported by the housing, wherein the white light imaging device and the fluorescence imaging device share at least a portion of a shared optical path within the housing.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the white light imaging device and the fluorescence imaging device share an imaging sensor.
3. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein: the white light imaging device comprises a white light source; the fluorescence imaging device comprises at least one laser; and the apparatus further comprises an optical element configured to combine an optical path of light emitted from the white light source with an optical path of light emitted from the at least one laser such that the light emitted from the white light source and the light emitted from the at least one laser share the shared optical path.
4. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein: the fluorescent imaging device comprises a first laser configured to emit light at a first wavelength and a second laser configured to emit light at a second wavelength; and the apparatus comprises: a first optical element configured to combine the optical path of light emitted from the white light source with an optical path of light emitted from the first laser; and a second optical element configured to combine the optical path of the light emitted from the white light source and the optical path of the light emitted from the first laser with an optical path of light emitted from the second laser, such that the light emitted from the white light source, the light emitted from the first laser, and the light emitted from the second laser share the shared optical path.
5. The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the shared optical path includes a path from the first optical element to an eye of the subject, and from the eye of the subject to the imaging sensor.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a reflector in the shared optical path, the reflector comprising an opening configured to allow light reflected from the retina fundus to pass through the reflector.
7. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a beam splitter configured to transmit light for the fluorescence imaging device to a fluorescence imaging sensor and reflect light for the white light imaging device to a white light image sensor.
8. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein a transmissivity of the beam splitter is greater than a reflectivity of the beam splitter.
9. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the fluorescence imaging sensor is configured to detect a fluorescence lifetime of at least one molecule in the subject's eye.
10. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the fluorescence imaging sensor is configured to detect a fluorescence wavelength of at least one molecule in the subject's eye.
12. A method comprising: imaging a retina fundus of a subject with a white light imaging device and a fluorescence imaging device which share, at least in part, an optical path.
13. A method comprising: imaging and/or measuring the retina fundus of a subject using an apparatus comprising at least two imaging and/or measuring devices selected from a group comprising: a white light imaging device; a fluorescence imaging device; and an optical coherence tomography device; and determining a medical status of the subject based on an image captured during imaging and/or measuring.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein determining the medical status comprises determining whether the subject suffers from an ocular disease.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the ocular disease comprises age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
16. The method of claim 14, wherein the ocular disease comprises Stargardt's disease.
17. The method of claim 14, wherein the ocular disease comprises diabetic retinopathy.
18. The method of claim 14, wherein the ocular disease comprises macular edema.
19. The method of claim 14, wherein the ocular disease comprises a macular hole.
20. The method of claim 14, wherein the ocular disease comprises eye floaters.
21. The method of claim 14, wherein the ocular disease comprises glaucoma.
22. The method of claim 14, wherein the ocular disease comprises retinal detachment.
23. The method of claim 14, wherein the ocular disease comprises cataracts.
24. The method of claim 14, wherein the ocular disease comprises macular telangiectasia.
25. The method of claim 13, wherein determining the medical status comprises determining whether the subject suffers from a non-ocular disease.
26. The method of claim 25, wherein the non-ocular disease comprises Alzheimer's.
27. The method of claim 26, wherein determining whether the subject suffers from Alzheimer's comprises determining a thickness of a retinal nerve fiber layer of the subject using the image.
28. The method of claim 25, wherein the non-ocular disease comprises Parkinson's.
29. The method of claim 28, wherein determining whether the subject suffers from Parkinson's comprises determining a thickness of a retinal nerve fiber layer of the subject using the image.
30. The method of claim 28, wherein determining whether the subject suffers from Parkinson's comprises determining a measure of eye-tracking capability using the image.
31. The method of claim 25, wherein the non-ocular disease comprises a concussion.
