<title>
Automatic calibration projection system and method
</title>

<abstract>
A method for automatically calibrating a system of projectors for displaying images, the method comprising the steps of selectively projecting pixels from a projector onto a projection surface, sensing the pixels as projected across the projection surface deriving a projector/screen mapping based on the selectively projected pixels and the sensed pixels, deriving a pixel correction function based on the projector/screen mapping, storing the pixel correction function by applying a texture map to a mapping mesh inside a graphical pipeline of a graphics processor unit (GPU), applying the pixel correction function to input image pixel data to produce corrected pixel data which corrects at least for misalignment, and driving the projector with the corrected pixel data.
