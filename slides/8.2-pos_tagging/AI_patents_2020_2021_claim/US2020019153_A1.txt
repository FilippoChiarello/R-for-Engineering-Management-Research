<title>
Real-Time Automation for Monitor and Control of Electro-Mechanical System
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented system is provided for monitoring an electro-mechanical device. The system includes a sensor, a data acquisition receiver, and an analysis processor. The sensor measures a parameter of the device as an analog signal. The data acquisition receiver converts the analog signal into a digital signal. The analysis processor assigns the signal data to a condition state responsive to an action mode to control the device. The system is intended for automated implementation in real-time.
