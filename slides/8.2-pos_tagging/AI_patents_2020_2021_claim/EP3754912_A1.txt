METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RECOMMENDING REPLY MESSAGE
</title>

<abstract>
A device for transmitting a reply message is provided. The device includes a touch screen; and a processor configured to execute the instructions to at least: in response to receiving a message from another electronic device, control a semantic analyzer to analyze a text of the received message for determining a sending intention of the message based on the analysis, and determine the category of the message based on the sending intention of the message, control the touch screen to display a user interface (UI), wherein the UI corresponds to the determined category, control the touch screen to receive a user input for selecting data to be included in the reply message through the UI, and transmit, to the another electronic device, the reply message including the data.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An electronic device (100, 100a, 100b) for transmitting a reply message, the electronic device (100, 100a, 100b) comprising: a touch screen; and a processor configured to execute the instructions to at least: in response to receiving a message from another electronic device, control a semantic analyzer to analyze a text of the received message for determining a sending intention of the message based on the analysis, and determine the category of the message based on the sending intention of the message, control the touch screen to display a user interface, UI, wherein the UI corresponds to the determined category, control the touch screen to receive a user input for selecting data to be included in the reply message through the UI, and transmit, to the another electronic device, the reply message including the data.
2. The electronic device (100, 100a, 100b) of claim 1, wherein the category comprises at least one of a time, a date, a place, an age, a size, a price, an activity, a food, a movie, and a person.
