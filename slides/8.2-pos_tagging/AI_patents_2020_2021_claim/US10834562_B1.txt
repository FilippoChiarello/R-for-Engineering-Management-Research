<title>
Lighting devices having wireless communication and built-in artificial intelligence bot
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems are described. One system is a light switch having a housing configured for a circuit for a switch and a wireless chip for wireless communication with an end-node. The light switch further includes a processor chip and memory for executing instructions and interfacing with the wireless chip and the switch. A microphone is integrated with the housing and a speaker is integrated with the housing. The instructions are processed by the processor chip in response to voice commands received by the microphone, and the processing of instructions is further configured to send data to the end node and receive data from the end node. The data received from the end node is used to provide an audible voice reply to one or more of the voice commands received by the microphone of the housing of the light switch. The voice commands are handled by the end node for artificial intelligence processing that includes accessing one or more external data sources and applying one or more learning algorithms for outputting the audible voice reply via the speaker of the light switch.

<claims>
1. A light switch, comprising, a housing configured for, a circuit for a switch; a wireless chip for wireless communication with an end-node; a processor chip and memory for executing instructions and interfacing with the wireless chip and the switch; a microphone integrated with the housing; a speaker integrated with the housing; wherein the instructions are processed by the processor chip in response to voice commands received by the microphone, the processing of instructions is further configured to send data to the end node using an Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) process and receive data from the end node, the data received from the end node is used in part to provide an audible voice reply to one or more of the voice commands received by the microphone of the housing of the light switch, wherein the end node of a cloud source that uses one or more learning algorithms and status information that was previously collected and stored for processing the voice commands to formulate a response to at least one voice command while the cloud source and light switch operate in a hub-and-spoke arrangement, wherein the cloud source operates as said hub of the MQTT process.
2. The light switch of claim 1, further including a device that is configured to pair with the light switch, such that the light switch exchanges data communication with the device.
3. The light switch of claim 2, wherein the device is in communication with the Internet, and the device is configured to communicate with one or more servers for handling the one or more learning algorithms.
4. The light switch of claim 3, wherein a cover of the housing includes a user interface for accessing the switch to cause a light to change state or for accessing the one or more learning algorithms.
5. The light switch of claim 1, wherein the end node functions as part of an artificial intelligence (AI) bot.
6. The light switch of claim 1, wherein said processor chip executes part of said one or more learning algorithms and said end node executes part of said one or more learning algorithms.
7. The light switch of claim 1, further comprising, a display screen, the display screen providing an interface for user input or display of information received by the light switch from the end node.
8. The light switch of claim 1, wherein the response is a notification.
9. The light switch of claim 1, wherein said MQTT process utilizes a key exchange protocol for security.
10. The light switch of claim 1, wherein said MQTT process is configured to enable data collection for remote monitoring.
11. The light switch of claim 1, wherein the cloud source is defined by one or more cloud resources or services, or combinations thereof.
12. A light switch, comprising, a wireless chip; a memory interfaced with the wireless chip; a microphone; a switch; a power source; a logic chip interfaced with the wireless chip, the memory, the power source, the switch and the microphone, the memory being programmed with functions that are executed by the logic chip, wherein the logic chip is configured to: i) read a state of the light switch and send the state and changes to the state to an end node via a Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) process for cloud processing and storage, ii) process signals encoding a voice action from a user via the microphone and send to the end node that applies one or more learning algorithms and status information that was previously collected and stored for processing the voice commands to formulate a response to at least one voice command while the end node and light switch operate in a hub-and-spoke arrangement, wherein said cloud processing operates as said hub of the MQTT process, iii) cause the light switch to receive the response to the voice action.
13. The light switch of claim 12, further comprising a speaker coupled to the logic chip, wherein the wireless chip is further configured to receive the response to the voice action, the logic chip further configured to process the response to provide audio output through the speaker, wherein the audio output from the speaker is responsive to the voice action.
14. The light switch of claim 13, wherein the end node is a remote artificial intelligence (AI) bot service on a wide area network and communication that is sent from the wireless chip is configured to pass through a hub device.
15. The light switch of claim 13, further comprising a display coupled to the logic chip, wherein the wireless chip further configured to receive the response to the voice action, the logic chip further configured to process the response to provide output to the display, wherein the output to the display is responsive to the voice action.
16. The light switch of claim 12, wherein the response is further provided to a device other than the light switch to cause a change in state of the device or another device.
17. The light switch of claim 12, wherein the response is a notification.
18. The light switch of claim 12, wherein said MQTT process utilizes a key exchange protocol for security.
19. The light switch of claim 12, wherein said MQTT process is configured to enable data collection for remote monitoring.
20. The light switch of claim 12, wherein the cloud processing is defined by one or more cloud resources or services, or combinations thereof.
21. The light switch of claim 12, wherein the light switch is further configured to transmit energy to an energy harvesting device.
