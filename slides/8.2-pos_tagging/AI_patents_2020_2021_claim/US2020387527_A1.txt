<title>
Architectural Frameworks, Functions and Interfaces for Relationship Management (AFFIRM)
</title>

<abstract>
Uniform subject and object oriented data structure adopted in computing device to efficiently store, distribute and process data in a variety of applications. Said data structure comprised of multiple complementary subparts that together and independently facilitate communication (of inputs and outputs) through one or more defined interfaces to facilitate secure access and coordination between given individual subject(s) and other real (physical or metaphysical) entities. Methods are also disclosed that work in tandem with the data structure and interface components to enable and require a single or given human user or other individual personal subject (belonging to a secure AFFIRM network) to maintain exclusive (private) self-control over at least one virtual domain that represents themselves (their actions and their relationships).

<claims>
1. A computing architecture and method for managing the socioeconomic interaction of any entity or network of entities (e.g. one or more individual entity, closed group of formally organized entities, closed group of self-organizing entities, and/or open public group of entities) herein together referred to as "the system", essentially comprised of: a uniform and universally applicable subject and object oriented data structure framework where each real subject entity in the system (e.g. at least those animate objects with a potential for initiating action in the system, but also inanimate objects, concepts, etc. with an individual essence or subjective existence in the system) is represented by a main subject-oriented domain where the subject entity is the actor and/or Home Subject (HS) and by other reference objects located in domains that interact with the subject entity to represent or reflect the subject entity as an object; uniquely addressable and accessible node location(s) for each domain of the system in a network space or interconnect medium; subject and object oriented application programming environment that enables a Home Subject actor(s), whether knowing the syntax of a computer coding languages or not, to create (i.e. program), access and operate application templates in their home domains to share and manage interaction with ones own and/or other domain(s) and the home subject(s) of these domain(s) in the process of planning, proposing, selecting, instantiating, staging and modifying reference objects referring to real entities and interactions with them so as to effect real change in the real entity(s) themselves; bilateral link(s) or reference object(s) that mutually point to each other and represent interaction(s), change(s) or exchange(s) are able to be created and proposed by HS(s) and affirmed by potentially interacting HS(s), with each interacting domain being updated with message objects that reference the interacting real entity and the current state of the change from the perspective of the HS of the domain as it evolves; exemplary bilateral links include mutual references between two respective domains signifying a potential partnership between their HS(s) that, once agreed to by both parties, will exist until a HS decide(s) to dissolve or discontinue the relationship; and discrete messaging, sharing and/or bilateral interaction mechanism where reference object(s) in the uniform data structure can be selectively sent from one sending domain to be selectively received by targeted partner recipient HS(s) and/or domain(s).
2. The computing architecture and method according to claim 1, further comprising: a uniform subject and object oriented data structure framework, instances of which are called Personal Domains (PD) because they are separately or exclusively created, applied, partitioned, located, addressed, accessed and controlled by a single actor (e.g. organization, person, guardian, etc.) that is or represents the Home Subject (HS); a subject and object oriented programming environment used by the HS without knowing specific syntax or codes of a computer language to program applications by creating, selecting and/or destroying reference objects and their links and states to be processed within a uniform and universally applicable meta-modeling framework; a pre-programmed planning, negotiation and interaction coordination protocol and mechanism that requires HS(s) controlling PD(s) involved in an interaction to agree to an interaction (e.g. the creation of a partnership, the sending and receiving of information, the exchange of physical goods or services, etc.) before an interaction can be scheduled and/or enacted; a pre-programmed monitoring, updating, archiving and learning mechanism that enables incremental interaction to be automatically recorded in the above uniform frameworks and then directly evaluated from the perspective of each PD and its HS; a pre-programmed process guidance mechanism that can automatically use results of past interactions and other accessible relevant data to evaluate alternative actions based on their relative attractiveness and recommended actions as well as predict behavior; a pre-programmed process control and actualization protocol and mechanism that enables interaction to be asynchronously planned and negotiated and then synchronously enacted or coordinated; an architecture and protocol for building "pragmatic webs" where subject plans, actions and feedback impact the meaning, conception, development and/or value of useful objects; and an architecture and protocol for managing the (dynamic) learning, development, coordination, protection and performance of socioeconomic entities in the system.
