<title>
VARIABLE AIR VOLUME MODELING FOR AN HVAC SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Methods for modeling heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) are described. A heuristic model of air handling in a HVAC system is optimized by a server based on measurements from outdoor sensors, from building space sensors, plant sensors, and sensors for the air handling. Settings of the air handling in the HVAC system are determined by the server from the model as optimized and transmitted to the HVAC system. The heuristic model may be optimized by indicating a mismatch of a fan with a space based on a diversity from a fan flow set point and a fan designed maximum flow; identifying a rogue zone or a critical zone of air handling units based on a number of actuator re-positioning, box pressures, and box flow; and/or determining a coupling of a coupled zone operation with temperature, flow, or temperature and flow.
