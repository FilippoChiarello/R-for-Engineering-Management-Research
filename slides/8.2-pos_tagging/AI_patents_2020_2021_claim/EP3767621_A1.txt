ONBOARD DEVICE, TRAVELING STATE ESTIMATION METHOD, SERVER DEVICE, INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD, AND TRAVELING STATE ESTIMATION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
To estimate a traveling state of a vehicle that may be influenced by the psychological state of a driver, based on an utterance of the driver without the use of various sensors. An onboard device includes: a voice collection unit configured to collect a voice produced by a driver; a traveling state collection unit configured to collect traveling state information representing a traveling state of a vehicle; a database generation unit configured to generate a database by associating voice information corresponding to the collected voice with the collected traveling state information; a learning unit configured to learn an estimation model, with pairs including the voice information and the traveling state information recorded in the generated database being used as learning data; and an estimation unit configured to estimate the traveling state of the vehicle that may be influenced by a psychological state of the driver by using the estimation model, based on an utterance of the driver.
