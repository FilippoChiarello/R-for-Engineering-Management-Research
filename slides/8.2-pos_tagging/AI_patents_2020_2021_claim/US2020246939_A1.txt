SUBSTRATE PROCESSING APPARATUS AND SUBSTRATE PROCESSING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
There is disclosed a substrate processing apparatus which can align a center of a substrate with a central axis of a process stage with high accuracy to prevent a defective substrate from being produced. The substrate processing apparatus includes: an eccentricity detecting mechanism configured to obtain an amount of eccentricity and an eccentricity direction of a center of the substrate, held on the centering stage, from a central axis of the centering stage; and an aligner configured to align the center of the substrate with a central axis of a process stage. The aligner obtains, after the substrate is transferred from the centering stage to the process stage, an amount of eccentricity and an eccentricity direction of the center of the substrate from the central axis of the process stage by use of the eccentricity detecting mechanism; and confirms that the obtained amount of eccentricity of the center of the substrate from the central axis of the process stage is within a predetermined allowable range.
