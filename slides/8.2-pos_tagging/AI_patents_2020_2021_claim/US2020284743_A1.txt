MORPHOLOGY ENGINEERING OF CONDUCTIVE METALLIC NANOPARTICLES CAPPED WITH AN ORGANIC COATING
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention is directed to a sensor having continuous and discontinuous regions of conductive metallic nanoparticles capped with an organic coating which enables the detection of volatile organic compounds and/or water vapor. Continuous regions may exhibit a positive response upon exposure to volatile organic compounds and to water vapor, while discontinuous regions exhibit a positive response upon exposure to volatile organic compounds and a negative response upon exposure to water vapor.

1. 1.-20. (canceled)
21. A method for detecting an analyte selected from a volatile organic compound, water vapor and combinations thereof in the breath of a subject or in a sample, the method comprising the steps of: providing a sensor comprising a discontinuous film of conductive metallic nanoparticles capped with an organic coating on a substrate, the discontinuous film being interrupted by voids in coverage on the substrate that are free from the conductive metallic nanoparticles, wherein the voids range in size between 10-500 nm, permitting ionic conduction through condensate water vapor in the voids; providing a positive response upon exposure to volatile organic compounds and a negative response upon exposure to water vapor, wherein the positive response is an increase above a baseline and the negative response is a decrease below the baseline, and wherein the negative response is larger magnitude than the positive response; exposing the sensor to the breath of a subject or to a sample comprising said analyte; and detecting a signal generated from said analyte contacting the sensor.
22. The method according to claim 21, comprising detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) while concurrently determining the amount of water vapor, the method further comprising the steps of: determining the amount of water vapor from the detected signal; and subtracting the amount of water vapor from the detected signal thereby allowing the detection of VOCs in the breath of a subject or in said sample.
23. The method according to claim 22, comprising applying a voltage to said sensor, and wherein the signal is detected at different applied voltages.
24. The method according to claim 23, comprising detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath of the subject, wherein a detected level of VOCs is indicative of the presence of disease in the subject, and concurrently determining an amount of water vapor.
25. The method according to claim 21 for monitoring the breathing of a subject comprising detecting a signal generated by water vapor present in each breath of said subject.
26. The method according to claim 21, comprising monitoring the signal from the breath of said subject over time to obtain a respiratory waveform of the breath of said subject.
27. The method according to claim 21, comprising activating an input device by detecting a signal generated by water vapor present in the breath of said subject, and changing a configuration of a switch by the detected signal to activate said input device.
28. A method of manufacturing a sensor according to claim 21, comprising forming a discontinuous film of conductive metallic nanoparticles capped with an organic coating on a substrate, the discontinuous film being interrupted by voids in coverage on the substrate that are free from the conductive metallic nanoparticles, wherein the voids range in size between 10-500 nm, permitting ionic conduction through condensate water vapor in the voids; providing a positive response upon exposure to volatile organic compounds and a negative response upon exposure to water vapor, wherein the positive response is an increase above a baseline and the negative response is a decrease below the baseline, and wherein the negative response is larger magnitude than the positive response; and further forming a continuous film of conductive metallic nanoparticles capped with an organic coating on the substrate adjacent the discontinuous film.
