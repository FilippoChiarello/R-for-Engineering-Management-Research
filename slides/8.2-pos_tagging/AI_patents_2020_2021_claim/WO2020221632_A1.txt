ELECTROCARDIOGRAM SIGNAL SEGMENTATION
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques are disclosed for segmenting electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. In one example, a method to segment an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal may include detecting consecutive heartbeats in an ECG signal. The method also includes segmenting the ECG signal into multiple ECG segments surrounding the detected consecutive heartbeats and generating an ECG data set by joining consecutive ECG segments. The generated the ECG data set represents the detected heartbeats. In some such examples, each ECG segment is of a duration to include a QRS complex, a P wave, and a T wave.

<claims>
1. A method to segment an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, the method comprising: detecting a plurality of consecutive heartbeats in an ECG signal; segmenting the ECG signal into a plurality of ECG segments surrounding the detected plurality of consecutive heartbeats; and generating an ECG data set by joining consecutive ECG segments; wherein the ECG data set represents the detected plurality of heartbeats.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein segmenting the ECG signal into the plurality of ECG segments comprises segmenting the ECG signal into fixed-size ECG segments.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein each ECG segment of the plurality of ECG segments is of a duration to include a QRS complex, a P wave, and a T wave.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the ECG data set includes instantaneous heart rate values or R-R interval values representative of distances between consecutive pairs of heartbeats.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the ECG data set includes one or more feature vectors, wherein a feature vector includes features specific for a corresponding heartbeat, a feature specifying the heartbeat's morphology, ECG signal condition, or physiological information gathered through non-ECG sensors, correlated with the heartbeat data.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising, in response to detecting a non-overlap of adjacent ECG segments, including an artificial heartbeat marker in the ECG data set to indicate an ECG fragment between the non-overlapping ECG segments.
7. A system to segment an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, the system comprising: one or more non-transitory machine-readable mediums configured to store instructions; and one or more processors configured to execute the instructions stored on the one or more nontransitory machine-readable mediums, wherein execution of the instructions causes the one or more processors to: detect N consecutive heartbeats in an ECG signal; segment the ECG signal into a plurality of ECG segments surrounding the detected N consecutive heartbeats; and generate an ECG data set by joining consecutive ECG segments; wherein the ECG data set represents the detected N heartbeats.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the plurality of ECG segments includes fixed-size ECG segments.
9. The system of claim 7, wherein each ECG segment of the plurality of ECG segments is of a duration to include a QRS complex, a P wave, and a T wave. 10. The system of claim 7, wherein the ECG data set includes instantaneous heart rate values or R-R interval values representative of distances between consecutive pairs of heartbeats.
11. The system of claim 7, wherein the ECG data set includes one or more feature vectors, wherein a feature vector includes features specific for a corresponding heartbeat.
12. The system of claim 7, wherein the ECG data set includes one or more feature vectors, wherein a feature vector includes a feature specifying the heartbeat's morphology.
13. The system of claim 7, wherein the ECG data set includes one or more feature vectors, wherein a feature vector includes an ECG signal condition.
14. The system of claim 7, wherein the ECG data set includes one or more feature vectors, wherein a feature vector includes physiological information correlated with a corresponding heartbeat.
15. The system of claim 7, wherein execution of the instructions causes the one or more processors to, in response to detection of a non-overlap of adjacent ECG segments, include an artificial heartbeat marker in the ECG data set to indicate an ECG fragment between the non overlapping ECG segments.
16. A computer program product including one or more non-transitory machine-readable mediums encoding instructions that when executed by one or more processors cause a process to be carried out for segmenting an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, the process comprising: detecting a plurality of consecutive heartbeats in an ECG signal; segmenting the ECG signal into a plurality of ECG segments surrounding the detected plurality of consecutive heartbeats, wherein each ECG segment of the plurality of ECG segments is of a duration to include a QRS complex, a P wave, and a T wave; and generating an ECG data set by joining consecutive ECG segments.
17. The computer program product of claim 16, wherein the plurality of ECG segments is of a fixed-size.
18. The computer program product of claim 16, wherein the ECG data set includes instantaneous heart rate values or R-R interval values representative of distances between consecutive pairs of heartbeats.
19. The computer program product of claim 16, wherein the ECG data set includes one or more feature vectors, wherein a feature vector includes features specific for a corresponding heartbeat, a feature specifying the heartbeat's morphology, ECG signal condition, or physiological information correlated with the corresponding heartbeat.
20. The computer program product of claim 16, wherein the process further comprises, in response to detection of a non-overlap of adjacent ECG segments, including an artificial heartbeat marker in the ECG data set to indicate an ECG fragment between the non-overlapping ECG segments.
