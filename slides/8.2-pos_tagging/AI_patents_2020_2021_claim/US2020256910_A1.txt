<title>
SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ANOMALY DETECTION IN AN ELECTRICAL NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
The present subject matter enables early or real-time detection of anomalies in electric networks. In various applications, the system detects anomalies, such as electricity theft, electricity surge, etc. It solves the difficult-to-detect problems in an electrical network, where anomalies like electricity theft or electrical surge may not be found until it has raised numerous concerns or complaints, or has created a significant impact on infrastructure functionality, service quality, or cost. In addition, the present subject matter decreases the requirement for large number of sensors and provides more cost effective and scalable solutions. The present subject matter provides a method for determining where a detected anomaly is occurring within an electrical network. Variations of the present subject matter include anomaly identification systems for addressing anomalies in large networks. Various applications of the present subject matter provide guidance or effective placement of sensors in the electrical network.
