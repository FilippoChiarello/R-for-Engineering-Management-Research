PHARMACEUTICAL PROCUREMENT AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
</title>

<abstract>
Management of pharmaceutical procurement for a pharmaceutical ordering location. A method includes determining a medication need and a drug product preference for an ordering location. The method includes identifying one or more drug products satisfying the medication need by communicating with one or more pharmaceutical suppliers and selecting at least one of the one or more drug products based on the drug product preference. The method includes generating a recommended order for the ordering location comprising the at least one of the one or more drug products.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: determining a medication need for an ordering location; determining a drug product preference for the ordering location, wherein the drug product preference comprises one or more of: a pricing preference, medication ordering permissions, a government pharmaceutical regulation, a contractual agreement, a package-type preference, or a drug shortage prediction; identifying one or more drug products satisfying the medication need offered by one or more pharmaceutical suppliers; selecting at least one of the one or more drug products based on the drug product preference; and generating a recommended order for the ordering location comprising the at least one of the one or more drug products and a recommended supplier of the one or more pharmaceutical suppliers.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the drug product preference for the ordering location further comprises one or more of: a formulary indicating a medication group; a sub-formulary indicating a sub-level medication group in which the ordering location has permission to purchase; government pricing program requirements; the contractual agreement, wherein the contractual agreement comprises one or more contracts with one or more of: a pharmaceutical supplier, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, a healthcare location, or a health system; a health system regulation; a package-type restriction; a unit-dose versus bulk-package preference; an indication of whether any of the one or more drug products is available internally in connection with the ordering location; or analysis regarding a likelihood that a medication will experience a future drug shortage.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: providing a medication to a neural network trained to calculate the drug shortage prediction for the medication and/or a drug product associated with the medication based on a plurality of factors; receiving from the neural network the drug shortage prediction indicating a likelihood of one or more of: a current shortage of the medication and/or the drug product associated with the medication; or a future shortage of the medication and/or the drug product associated with the medication; determining whether the likelihood of the drug shortage prediction meets a threshold; and in response to the likelihood of the drug shortage prediction meeting the threshold, generating a notification for a user indicating the drug shortage prediction for the medication.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein identifying the one or more drug products comprises identifying a plurality of drug products that satisfy the medication need and the drug product preference, and wherein the method further comprises sorting the plurality of drug products to generate sorted drug products based on one or more of: unit price; supplier preference for the ordering location; contract preference rating for the ordering location; or package size and/or package configuration preferences for the ordering location.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising: identifying a top drug product based on the sorted drug products; determining whether the ordering location has previously purchased the top drug product; in response to determining the ordering location has previously purchased the top drug product, performing one or more of: automatically ordering the top drug product on behalf of the ordering location by communicating with a supplier for the top drug product; or facilitating a user-initiated transaction for ordering the top drug product using one or more of secure file transfer protocol (SFTP), an application program interface (API), a fax message, or an email; and in response to determining the ordering location has not previously purchased the top drug product, generating a message indicating the top drug product is a new drug product for the ordering location.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising calculating business analytics feedback for the ordering location comprising recommendations for pharmaceutical procurement, wherein calculating the business analytics feedback comprises calculating based on one or more of: supplier contract terms with one or more potential pharmaceutical suppliers; supplier data received from the one or more potential pharmaceutical suppliers; pharmaceutical formularies; pharmaceutical availability; pharmaceutical pricing options, including contractual pricing options, rebate pricing options, and/or government pricing program options; or pharmaceutical packaging characteristics.
