METHOD AND CONTROLLER FOR CONTROLLING A CHILLER PLANT FOR A BUILDING AND CHILLER PLANT
</title>

<abstract>
According to the invention, environmental data (ED) of an environment of the building (BD) and cooling load demand data (CLD) are received as first training data, which are used for training a first machine learning model (NN1) to predict a cooling load demand from environmental data. Furthermore, control signals (CS) for the chiller plant (CP) and cooling power data (CPD) resulting from applying the control signals (CS) to the chiller plant (CP) are received as second training data. The second training data are used for training a second machine learning model (NN2) to predict a cooling power from control signals. Moreover, actual environmental data (ED) are received, from which a cooling load demand (CLDP) is predicted by the trained first machine learning model (NN1). Furthermore, candidate control signals (CCS) for the chiller plant (CP) are generated, and from the candidate control signals (CCS) a resulting cooling power (CPP) is predicted by the trained second machine learning model (NN2). From the candidate control signals (CCS), applicable control signals (ACS) are selected for which a predicted cooling power (CPP) fulfills the predicted cooling load demand (CLDP).
