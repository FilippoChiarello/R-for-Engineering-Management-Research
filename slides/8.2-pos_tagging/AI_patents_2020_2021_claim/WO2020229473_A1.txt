<abstract>
Techniques for adjusting radiotherapy treatment for a patient in real-time are provided. The techniques include determining a patient anatomy at a first time within a given radiotherapy treatment fraction after a radiotherapy treatment dose has been delivered by a radiotherapy device; retrieving a reference patient anatomy for the given radiotherapy treatment fraction that indicates a prescribed dose parameter to be delivered within the given radiotherapy treatment fraction; comparing the patient anatomy at the first time with the reference patient anatomy during the given radiotherapy treatment fraction; and based on the comparison of the patient anatomy at the first time with the reference patient anatomy, adjusting a parameter of the radiotherapy device to change an amount of radiotherapy treatment dose delivered at a second time, following the first time, within the given radiotherapy treatment fraction in accordance with the prescribed dose parameter to be delivered within the given radiotherapy treatment fraction.
