METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DETECTING AND AVOIDING LOSS OF SEPARATION BETWEEN VEHICLES AND UPDATING THE SAME
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are methods, systems, and non-transitory computer-readable mediums for detecting and avoiding loss of separation between vehicles. A first method may include training a vehicle interaction machine learning model to predict future vehicle interactions based on identified vehicle interactions and an identified risk of encounter between two or more selected vehicles. A second method may include obtaining real-time data associated with a vehicle-of-interest; evaluating the real-time data associated with the vehicle-of-interest to form encounter models; monitoring the encounter models with a model access function of the vehicle interaction machine learning model to detect real-time anomalies; and in response to detecting a real-time anomaly, transmitting an alert. A third method may include obtaining trajectory information; analyzing the trajectory information to determine whether a trajectory is a new trajectory type or whether the trajectory is a member of a new interaction; updating training data for the vehicle interaction machine learning model.

<claims>
1. A method for updating a vehicle interaction machine learning model, the method comprising: obtaining trajectory information indicating trajectories of vehicles; analyzing the trajectory information to determine whether a trajectory is a new trajectory type or whether the trajectory is a member of a new interaction; in response to determining the trajectory is a new trajectory type or the trajectory is a member of a new interaction, updating training data for the vehicle interaction machine learning model; and training the vehicle interaction machine learning model based on the updated training data.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the analyzing the trajectory information includes: obtaining trajectory type information indicating a plurality of stored trajectory types; comparing the trajectory of the trajectory information to a trajectory type of the plurality of stored trajectory types; in response to a comparison result of the comparing indicating a dissimilarity value more than a threshold dissimilarity value, identifying the trajectory as a potential new trajectory type, the potential new trajectory type being added to the plurality of stored trajectory types; and in response to the comparison result indicating the dissimilarity value being less than or equal to the threshold dissimilarity value, adding the trajectory to a history of one of the plurality of the stored trajectory types.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: in response to the comparing, determining whether any potential new trajectory types of the plurality of stored trajectory types have sufficient history; in response to one or more potential new trajectory types having a sufficient history, verifying whether the one or more potential new trajectory types are new trajectory types; and in response to at least one new trajectory type being verified, adding the at least one new trajectory type as the new trajectory type to the training data.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the comparing the trajectory of the trajectory information to the trajectory type includes: determining a minimum distance between points of the trajectory to points of the trajectory type; and determining the comparison result by assigning the minimum distance as the dissimilarity value.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the trajectory is a first trajectory, and
the analyzing the trajectory information includes: obtaining trajectory type information indicating a plurality of stored trajectory types; comparing the first trajectory of the trajectory information to a trajectory type of the plurality of stored trajectory types or comparing the first trajectory to second trajectory of the trajectory information, the first trajectory being for a first vehicle and the second trajectory being for a second vehicle operating at the same time as the first vehicle; and in response to a comparison result of the comparing indicating a value less than a model separation threshold value, determining whether the first trajectory is a member of a new trajectory based on the first trajectory and the trajectory type or the second trajectory.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the determining whether the first trajectory is a member of a new trajectory includes: determining whether an interaction of a first trajectory type of the first trajectory and a second trajectory type of the second trajectory or the trajectory type is equivalent to any interactions stored in an interactions database; and in response to determining that the interaction is not equivalent to any interactions stored in the interactions database, adding the interaction to the interactions database.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the determining whether the interaction is equivalent to any interactions stored in the interactions database includes
determining tile spaces for the interaction and the interactions in the interactions database, the tile spaces being a geographic area and/or speed profile associated with a segment of a trajectory for a first interaction aircraft that is closest to a segment of a trajectory of a second interaction aircraft;
determining whether a tile space for the interaction intersects with any of tile spaces for the interactions; and
in response to the tile space of the interaction not intersecting with any of the tile spaces for the interactions, determining that the interaction is not equivalent to any interactions stored in the interactions database.
8. A system for updating a vehicle interaction machine learning model, the system comprising: a memory storing instructions; and a processor executing the instructions to perform a process including: obtaining trajectory information indicating trajectories of vehicles; analyzing the trajectory information to determine whether a trajectory is a new trajectory type or whether the trajectory is a member of a new interaction; in response to determining the trajectory is a new trajectory type or the trajectory is a member of a new interaction, updating training data for the vehicle interaction machine learning model; and training the vehicle interaction machine learning model based on the updated training data.
