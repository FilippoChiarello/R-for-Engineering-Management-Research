<title>
Controlling multi-stage manufacturing process based on internet of things (IOT) sensors and cognitive rule induction
</title>

<abstract>
Controlling product production in multi-stage manufacturing process automatically generates by machine learning causal relationships between the processing conditions and the product quality based on product genealogy data and product quality data. Real time sensor data from sensors coupled to processing units in a manufacturing facility implementing the multi-stage manufacturing process are received, and control rules are instantiated based on the real time sensor data. An instantiated control rule firing causes an actuator to automatically set a processing variable to a set point specified in the control rule.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method of controlling product production in multi-stage manufacturing process, the method performed by at least one hardware processor, comprising: receiving product genealogy data comprising at least a history of processing conditions at stages in the multi-stage manufacturing process in manufacturing a product, the processing conditions expressed in terms of process variables and corresponding values measured by sensors coupled to processing units in a manufacturing facility implementing the multi-stage manufacturing process; selecting a subset of process variables that influence product quality, from the process variables; executing a machine learning algorithm with the product genealogy data and the subset of process variables as input, the machine learning algorithm learning causal relationships between the processing conditions and the product quality; automatically generating a control rule based on at least one of the causal relationships, the control rule for controlling a process variable set point at a stage in the multi-stage manufacturing process; receiving real time sensor data from at least one of the sensors; instantiating the control rule based on the real time sensor data, wherein the control rule is fired responsive to the real time sensor data meeting a conditional part of the control rule; responsive to the control rule firing, controlling an actuator coupled to at least one of the processing units to set a processing variable to a set point specified in the control rule; and causing displaying on a user interface display a single view comprising multiple panels that display historical product defect information in graph format, the control rules that are generated, manufacturing process stages the multi-stage manufacturing process, control actions taken based on the instantiating of the control rules, and real time product defect information in the graph format.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the control rule comprises a plurality of control rules, the method further comprising ranking the control rules that are generated and selecting a subset of the control rules that are top ranked according to a defined threshold, wherein the control rule that is instantiated is in the top ranked subset.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: configuring an Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity messaging platform to control and receive the real time sensor data from the sensors at every specified interval of time continuously.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the product genealogy data is built based on the real time data received from the IoT connectivity messaging platform.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the control rule includes at least a feedback rule.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the control rule includes at least a feed forward rule.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the manufacturing facility is a steel manufacturing facility and the processing units comprises at least blast furnace, oxygen furnace, casting unit, hot rolling unit and cold rolling unit.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the control rule includes at least a rule that sets an operating condition of a current manufacturing process stage.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the control rule includes at least a rule that sets an operating condition at a future manufacturing process stage that follows a current manufacturing process stage.
