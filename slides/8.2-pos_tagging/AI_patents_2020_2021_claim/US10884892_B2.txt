Non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, display control method and display control device for observing anomolies within data
</title>

<abstract>
A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing a program that causes a computer to execute a process including collecting information of a plurality of kinds of observation data for each of a plurality of devices, performing anomaly detection processing on the collected plurality of kinds of observation data, displaying a first display indicating a relation between a time period in which an anomaly is detected within a specific period and a device in which the anomaly is detected, displaying a second display upon receiving a first designation of the device and the time period in the first display, the second display indicating a relation between the time period and the observation data, and displaying a third display upon receiving a second designation of observation data in the second display, the third display indicating time series changes in the observation data specified in the second display and the designated time period.

<claims>
1. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing a program that causes a computer to execute a process, the process comprising: collecting information of a plurality of kinds of observation data for each of a plurality of target devices; performing anomaly detection processing on the collected plurality of kinds of observation data; displaying, on a screen of a display device, a first display indicating a correspondence relation between a first time period in which a first anomaly is detected within a specific period and a target device in which the first anomaly is detected based on a result of the anomaly detection processing; displaying, on the screen, a second display upon receiving a first designation of the target device and a second time period that is a part of the first time period in the first display, the second display indicating whether a second anomaly is detected for each of the plurality of kinds of observation data in the second time period of the target device designated in the first designation; and displaying, on the screen, a third display upon receiving a second designation of specific observation data in the second display, the third display indicating time series changes in the specific observation data designated in the second designation and the second time period.
2. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 1, wherein the displaying the second display displays the second display when the first designation is received and when a selection for excluding another part of the first time period in the first designation is received after a reception of the first designation.
3. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 1, wherein the process further comprises: displaying, on the screen, a fourth display when the first designation is received and when a selection for leaving the first time period in the first designation is received after a reception of the first designation, the fourth display indicating a correspondence relation between the second time period in which the second anomaly is detected based on the plurality of kinds of observation data in the first time period in the designated target device and the specific observation data designated in the second designation.
4. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 1, wherein the first display includes pieces of identification information corresponding to the plurality of target devices in which the first anomaly is detected, the pieces of identification information being displayed in accordance with an arrangement order of the pieces of identification information determined based on a number of detected anomalies detected within the specific period.
5. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 1, wherein the second display includes pieces of identification information corresponding to the plurality of target devices in which the second anomaly is detected, the pieces of identification information being displayed in accordance with an arrangement order of the pieces of identification information determined based on a number of detected anomalies detected within the specific period.
6. The non-transitory computer-readable storage medium according to claim 1, wherein the specific period is changeable based on a setting or a selection.
7. A display control method executed by a computer, the display control method comprising: collecting information of a plurality of kinds of observation data for each of a plurality of target devices; performing anomaly detection processing on the collected plurality of kinds of observation data; displaying, on a screen of a display device, a first display indicating a correspondence relation between a first time period in which a first anomaly is detected within a specific period and a target device in which the first anomaly is detected based on a result of the anomaly detection processing; displaying, on the screen, a second display upon receiving a first designation of the target device a second time period that is a part of the first time period in the first display, the second display indicating whether a second anomaly is detected for each of the plurality of kinds of observation data in the second time period of the target device designated in the first designation; and displaying, on the screen, a third display upon receiving a second designation of specific observation data in the second display, the third display indicating time series changes in the specific observation data designated in the second designation and the second time period.
8. A display control device comprising: a memory; and a processor coupled to the memory and the processor configured to execute a process, the process including: collecting information of a plurality of kinds of observation data for each of a plurality of target devices; performing anomaly detection processing on the collected plurality of kinds of observation data; displaying, on a screen of a display device, a first display indicating a correspondence relation between a first time period in which a first anomaly is detected within a specific period and a target device in which the first anomaly is detected based on a result of the anomaly detection processing; displaying, on the screen, a second display upon receiving a first designation of the target device and a second time period limited by a part of the first time period in the first display, the second display indicating whether a second anomaly is detected for each of the plurality of kinds of observation data in the second time period of the designated target device; and displaying, on the screen, a third display upon receiving a second designation of specific observation data in the second display, the third display indicating time series changes in the specific observation data designated in the second designation and the second time period.
