GRAPHICS PROCESSOR DATA ACCESS AND SHARING
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments are generally directed to graphics processor data access and sharing. An embodiment of an apparatus includes a circuit element to produce a result in processing of an application; a load-store unit to receive the result and generate pre-fetch information for a cache utilizing the result; and a prefetch generator to produce prefetch addresses based at least in part on the pre-fetch information; wherein the load-store unit is to receive software assistance for prefetching, and wherein generation of the pre-fetch information is based at least in part on the software assistance.
</abstract>

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. An apparatus comprising:
a circuit element to produce a result in processing of an application;
a load-store unit to receive the result and generate pre-fetch information for a cache utilizing the result; and
a prefetch generator to produce prefetch addresses based at least in part on the pre-fetch information;
wherein the load-store unit is to receive software assistance for prefetching, and wherein generation of the pre-fetch information is based at least in part on the software assistance.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the software assistance includes a suggested prefetch stride.
3. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the prefetch stride defines a range of addresses for a prefetch operation.
4. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the suggested prefetch stride is generated based on data request patterns for the application.
5. The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the suggested prefetch stride is modified dynamically in response to changes in the data request patterns.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the apparatus includes a graphics processing unit (GPU).
7. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the circuit element includes an arithmetic logic unit (ALU).
8. A method comprising:
receiving, at a load-store unit of an apparatus, a result produced by a circuit element in processing of an application;
receiving software assistance for pre-fetching at the load-store unit; and
generating prefetch information by the load-store unit;
wherein the prefetch information is generated based at least in part on the result and the software assistance.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the software assistance includes a suggested prefetch stride.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the prefetch stride defines a range of addresses for a prefetch operation.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the suggested prefetch stride is generated based on data request patterns for the application.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the suggested prefetch stride is modified dynamically in response to changes in the data request patterns.
13. The method of claim 8, wherein the apparatus includes a graphics processing unit (GPU).
14. The method of claim 8, wherein the circuit element includes an arithmetic logic unit (ALU).
15. One or more non-transitory computer-readable storage mediums having stored thereon executable computer program instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform operations comprising:
analyzing operation of an application that is processed by a processor;
determining data request patterns for the application based on analysis of the operation of the application;
generating software assistance for prefetching based at least in part on the determined data request patterns; and
providing the software assistance to a load-store unit of the processor.
16. The one or more computer-readable storage mediums of claim 15, wherein generating the software assistance includes generating a suggested prefetch stride.
17. The one or more computer-readable storage mediums of claim 16, wherein the suggested prefetch stride defines a range of addresses for a prefetch operation.
18. The one or more computer-readable storage mediums of claim 16, further comprising instructions for:
dynamically modifying the suggested prefetch stride in response to changes in the data request patterns; and
providing modified software assistance including the modified suggested prefetch stride to the load-store unit.
19. The one or more computer-readable storage mediums of claim 15, wherein the processor is a graphics processing unit (GPU).
