HOSPITAL INFORMATION SYSTEM AND IMAGE DATA GENERATION METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
According to one embodiment, a hospital information system includes processing circuitry. The processing circuitry acquires information on an administration timing of a medicine to a patient and information on temporal changes of a medication effect of the medicine. The processing circuitry generates image data indicating the information on the administration timing and the information on temporal changes of the medication effect on a common time axis.

<claims>
1. A hospital information system comprising: processing circuitry configured to: acquire information on an administration timing of a medicine to a patient and information on temporal changes of a medication effect of the medicine; and generate image data indicating the information on the administration timing and the information on temporal changes of the medication effect on a common time axis.
2. The hospital information system according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry acquires information on temporal changes of a condition of the patient into which the medicine has been administered, and indicates the information on the temporal changes of the condition of the patient on the common time axis in the image data.
3. The hospital information system according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry indicates the information on the administration timing and the information on the temporal changes of the medication effect on an identical graph.
4. The hospital information system according to claim 2, wherein the processing circuitry indicates the information on the administration timing, the information on the temporal changes of the medication effect, and the information on the temporal changes of the condition of the patient on an identical graph.
5. The hospital information system according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry indicates the information on the temporal changes of the medication effect in a line graph.
6. The hospital information system according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry indicates the information on the temporal changes of the medication effect by grayscale.
7. The hospital information system according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry indicates the information on the temporal changes of the medication effect by transmittance.
8. The hospital information system according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry analyzes patient information on the patient and medical care information, and outputs the information on temporal changes of the medication effect of the medicine.
9. The hospital information system according to claim 8, wherein personally identifiable information is deleted from the patient information.
10. The hospital information system according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry acquires the information on the temporal changes of the medication effect of the medicine, based on information included in package insert information included in a pharmaceutical medicine, and indicating a relationship between a blood concentration in the patient into which the pharmaceutical medicine has been administered and the time elapsed since the administration.
11. The hospital information system according to claim 1, wherein the information on the temporal changes of the condition of the patient includes values representing vital signs acquired through measurement of the patient.
12. The hospital information system according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry indicates the information on the temporal changes of the medication effect on a percentage basis, assuming that a predetermined value is 100.
13. The hospital information system according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry displays an image based on image data.
14. An image data generation method comprising: acquiring information on an administration timing of a medicine to a patient and information on temporal changes of a medication effect of the medicine; and generating image data indicating the information on the administration timing and the information on temporal changes of the medication effect on a common time axis.
