MEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING APPARATUS AND MEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
Provided is a medical image processing apparatus including: an image acquisition unit that obtains a medical image of a subject; and an image processing unit that generates a second medical image by applying predetermined image processing on the medical image. The image processing unit includes: a surface area extraction unit that extracts a surface area including information that can lead to individuality determination or identification of the subject, from the medical image; a body orientation determination unit that determines body orientation on the basis of the surface area; a surface area deformation unit that deforms the surface area of the medical image; and an object assignment unit that assigns an object indicating the body orientation to the medical image in which the surface area has been deformed and that generates the second medical image.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A medical image processing apparatus comprising: an image acquisition unit that obtains a medical image of a subject; and an image processing unit that generates a second medical image by applying predetermined image processing on the medical image, wherein the image processing unit includes: a surface area extraction unit that extracts a surface area including information that can lead to individuality determination or identification of the subject, from the medical image; a body orientation determination unit that determines body orientation on the basis of the surface area; a surface area deformation unit that deforms the surface area of the medical image; and an object assignment unit that assigns an object indicating the body orientation to the medical image in which the surface area has been deformed and that generates the second medical image.
2. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the surface area deformation unit performs one of deletion of the surface area or deformation of the surface area based on blur processing or morphing processing.
3. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein, in a case where the medical image is a head image, the surface area includes any of eyes, nose, mouth, or ears.
4. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the object assignment unit replaces any of the eyes, nose, mouth, or ears included in the surface area, with objects simulating the eyes, nose, mouth, or ears.
5. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 3, further comprising: an input unit that receives designation, by an operator, of eyes, nose, mouth, and ears related to information that can lead to individuality determination or identification; and a condition acquisition unit that obtains information related to the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears, designated on the medical image, wherein the surface area extraction unit extracts the surface area on the basis of the information obtained by the condition acquisition unit.
6. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein, in a case where the medical image is an axial image of a head, the body orientation determination unit checks matching between a binarized image of the axial image with an affine-transformed ellipse and thereby determines the body orientation.
7. The medical image processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the surface area deformation unit selects a deformation target in accordance with a disease.
8. A medical image processing method comprising: obtaining a medical image of a subject; and generating a second medical image by applying predetermined image processing on the medical image, wherein the generating includes: extracting a surface area including information that can lead to individuality determination or identification of the subject, from the medical image; determining body orientation on the basis of the surface area; deforming the surface area of the medical image; and assigning an object indicating the body orientation to the medical image in which the surface area has been deformed and that generates the second medical image.
