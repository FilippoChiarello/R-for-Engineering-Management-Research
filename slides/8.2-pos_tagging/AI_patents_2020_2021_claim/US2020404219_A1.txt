6. The system of claim 1, wherein the interactive volumes comprise interactive reality volumes created by distance interpolation methods applied on the one or more interactive elements to calculate height and shape of each of the one or more interactive elements.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the interactive environment is a computer-generated environment or an event including real-life elements combined with computer-generated elements, including at least one of a concurrently or synchronously experienced game-session, a live collaborative engagement of users, an e-shopping session, a digital auction, a crowdfunding activity, a social environment, a sports event, a cultural event, a social event, a television show, a political speech, a live conference, or a board meeting.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the immersive experiences enable a plurality of remote viewers to be virtually transported to a live event and further enables a virtual event to be projected and mapped against surrounding areas of the at least one plurality of remote viewers.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the memory of the server stores a persistent virtual world system comprising at least one virtual replica of a corresponding real object, wherein the virtual 3D world coordinates and virtual properties of the virtual replicas are based on the 3D world coordinates and properties of the real objects, and wherein the plurality of interactive live environments is continuously updated in the persistent virtual world system.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the viewer feedback is presented within the interactive environment, is recorded by the recording equipment, and is transferred back to the at least some remote viewers, thereby creating an immediate response on the viewer feedback.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the plurality of interactive environments comprises both physical environments hosting the live event and computer-generated, virtual environments in which the live event is taking place.
12. A method for remote participation in live events, comprising: providing a plurality of interactive environments, each interactive environment hosting a live event; providing recording equipment to record the live event in the corresponding interactive environment; continuously recording the live event in the corresponding interactive environment; sending the recording of the live event in the corresponding interactive environment to one or more remote servers, each of the one or more remote servers comprising at least a processing unit, memory, and at least one renderer; processing, by the at least one processing unit, the recording to generate interactive volumes on interactive elements; generating, by the at least one processing unit, immersive experiences comprising the interactive volumes on the interactive elements; rendering, by the at least one renderer, the immersive experiences to generate immersive media streams; sending the immersive data streams to one or more remote viewers; permitting the one or more remote viewers to interact with the immersive experiences on one or more interaction devices that display the immersive media streams, thereby generating viewer feedback on the immersive experiences; receiving the viewer feedback; executing, by the processing unit, the passive manipulation instructions to only update the immersive experiences sent to at least one of the one or more remote viewers via the immersive data streams, and/or executing, by the processing unit, the active manipulation instructions to update the live event along with the immersive experiences; and updating, by the at least one processing unit and renderer, the interactive environment by initiating an action within the interactive environment, or updating the immersive content on the processed feedback, or combinations thereof.
