<title>
Method for dispatching a vehicle to a user's location
</title>

<abstract>
One variation of a method for determining a location of a user includes: at a mobile computing device, receiving from the user a request for pickup by a road vehicle; accessing an optical image recorded by the mobile computing device at approximately the first time; detecting a set of image features in the optical image; accessing an approximate location of the mobile computing device from a geospatial positioning system; accessing a set of known features associated with geographic locations within a threshold distance of the approximate location; in response to detecting correspondence between a first image feature in the set of image features and a first known feature in the set of known features, extrapolating an action geographic location of the mobile computing device based on a particular geographic location associated with the particular known feature; and dispatching an autonomous vehicle to proximal the actual geographic location.

2. The method of claim 1, wherein dispatching the autonomous vehicle to the pickup location proximal the actual geographic location comprises assigning a street location proximal the actual geographic location.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein a video is recorded with the mobile computing device in response to initiation of a rideshare application on the mobile computing device, a set of optical images extracted from the video being compiled into a three-dimensional model of a space occupied by the mobile computing device based on detected motion of the mobile computing device during recordation of the video, the set of image features being extracted from the three-dimensional model.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: detecting a second set of image features obtained at a second time succeeding the first time; receiving an optical data stream from the autonomous vehicle; and confirming proximity of the autonomous vehicle to the mobile computing device by scanning the optical data stream for one or more features exhibiting correspondence to the second set of image features.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the set of optical features is included in a photographic image.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein detecting the set of image features represented by the set of optical features comprises extracting a set of alphanumeric character sequences from the set optical features, the method further comprising: accessing a localization map comprising a set of known text strings, each known text string in the set of known text strings associated with a geographic location that the known text string is known to occupy in real space; and scanning the localization map for at least one known text string in the set of known text strings that contains one or more alphanumeric character sequences in the set of alphanumeric character sequences; identifying a first cluster of geographically-neighboring known text strings containing a first subset of the set of alphanumeric character sequences; identifying a second cluster of geographically-neighboring known text strings containing a second subset of the set of alphanumeric character sequences; and in response to a first size of the first cluster of geographically-neighboring known text strings exceeding a second size of the second cluster of geographically-neighboring known text strings, extrapolating the actual geographic location of the mobile computing device based on relative positions of the first subset of the set of alphanumeric character sequences and geographic locations associated with the first cluster of geographically-neighboring known text strings.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein accessing the localization map comprises accessing the localization map labeled with known text strings representing one or more of street signs, street numbers, and exterior building signage within a geographic region, each of the set of known text strings associated with a geographic location in the localization map.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein calculating the actual geographic location of the mobile computing device comprises localizing the mobile computing device to a particular building in the geographic region in response to detecting correspondence between a group of known edge features in a localization map and a set of image edge features detected in the set of optical features, the group of known edge features associated with the particular building, the autonomous vehicle being dispatched to the particular building, the autonomous vehicle being dispatched to a particular street location proximal to a particular known access point associated with the particular building as the pickup location when the actual geographic location includes a particular interior space.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising: indicating the particular building on a map rendered on a display of the mobile computing device; serving a notification on the display of the mobile computing device to confirm occupation of the particular building by the user; and in response to receipt of confirmation from the user, updating a representation of an interior of the particular building according to the set of image edge features.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving a video from the autonomous vehicle; rendering the video on a display of the mobile computing device; scanning the video for features exhibiting correspondence to image features in the set of image features; and in response to detecting a feature in the video exhibiting correspondence to an image feature in the set of image features, highlighting the feature in the video rendered on the display of the mobile computing device.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein scanning the set of known features for correspondence to the one or more image features in the set of image features comprises: accessing a localization map comprising a corpus of known features representing a geographic region; defining a subregion, within the geographic region, containing the approximate location and extending radially from the approximate location by the threshold distance; and scanning an area of the localization map corresponding to the subregion for any known features in the set of known features corresponding to the set of image features; and wherein calculating the actual geographic location of the mobile computing device comprises, in response to detecting correspondence between the first image feature and the first known feature, a second image feature and a second known feature, and a third image feature and a third known feature, triangulating the actual geographic position of the mobile computing device based on: positions of the first image feature, the second feature, and the third image feature in the set of optical features; geometries of the first image feature, the second image feature, and the third image feature in the set of optical features; and the first geographic location associated with the first known feature, a second geographic location associated with the second known feature, and a third geographic location associated with the third known feature in the localization map.
