Apparatus and method for informed personal well-being decision making
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus and method for informed personal-well-being decision making that provides a user with alerts and information, focused on health and wellness, on items they choose for possible consumption. Some embodiments include optical, sonic, smell and other sensors, communications with databases that identify ingredients and effects on health and well-being, as well as user inputs. From user input, GPS, local conditions and alerts, some embodiments determine information specific to the user and their environment. By using established, and creating new, databases, some embodiments compile, compare, transmit and store data on various consumables. Some embodiments provide access to information on the companies, manufacturers, and various other components in an item's trip from dirt to table. Some embodiments establish methods and procedures to ascertain both the point-of-origin and where the consumable has traveled. Some embodiments provide a score for the specified consumable to show the quality of health provided by the consumable.
