<title>
SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING OPTIMAL EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION CHANNEL FOR SUBJECT ENGAGEMENT
</title>

<abstract>
A machine learning based recommendation model, including a supervised learning classifier configured to receive input training data that includes a plurality of behavioral determinants, a supervised learning model configured to receive subject input data that includes a plurality of behavior determinants, wherein the supervised learning model outputs a predicted behavior of a subject, and a channel selection module configured to receive the subject input data and the predicted behavior and to determine a recommended communication channel for the subject to follow to achieve the predicted behavior.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A machine learning based recommendation model, comprising: a supervised learning classifier configured to receive input training data that includes a plurality of behavioral determinants; a supervised learning model configured to receive subject input data that includes a plurality of behavior determinants, wherein the supervised learning model outputs a predicted behavior of a subject; and a channel selection module configured to receive the subject input data and the predicted behavior and to determine a recommended communication channel for the subject to follow to achieve the predicted behavior.
2. The machine learning based recommendation model of claim 1, wherein the selected channel, predicted behavior, and actual behavior of the subject are used to further train the supervised learning model.
3. The machine learning based recommendation model of claim 1, wherein the supervised learning model is trained using testing input data.
4. The machine learning based recommendation model of claim 1, wherein the channel selection module is trained using the training input data.
5. The machine learning based recommendation model of claim 4, wherein the channel selection module uses heuristic rules.
6. The machine learning based recommendation model of claim 1, wherein the channel selection module produces a table of recommended channels associated various subject input parameters.
7. The machine learning based recommendation model of claim 1, wherein the channel selection module is configured to overrule the recommended channel based upon a severity of a subject disease burden.
8. A method of producing machine learning based communication channel recommendation model, comprising: training a supervised learning classifier using input training data that includes a plurality of behavioral determinants; training a supervised learning model configured using test input data that includes a plurality of behavior determinants, wherein the supervised learning model outputs a predicted behavior of a subject; and training a channel selection module based upon the test input data and the predicted behavior, wherein the channel selection module is configured to determine a recommended communication channel for the subject to follow to achieve the predicted behavior.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the selected channel, predicted behavior, and actual behavior of the subject are used to further train the supervisor learning model.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the channel selection module uses heuristic rules.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein the channel selection module produces a table of recommended channels associated various subject input parameters.
12. The machine learning based recommendation model of claim 1, wherein the channel selection module is configured to overrule the recommended channel based upon a severity of a subject disease burden.
