OPTIMIZING MACHINE LEARNED MODELS BASED ON DWELL TIME OF NETWORKED-TRANSMITTED CONTENT ITEMS
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques for optimizing machine-learned models based on dwell time of network-transmitted content items are provided. In one technique, impression data and selection data are used train a selection prediction model. For each impression, a dwell time associated with that impression is determined and compared to a skip time. If the dwell time is less than the skip time, then a first training label that indicates that the impression is skipped is associated with the impression. If the dwell time is greater than the skip time, then a second training label that indicates that the impression is not skipped is associated with the impression. These training labels are used to train a skip prediction model. The selection prediction model and the skip prediction model are used in a content item selection event to generate a score for each candidate content item. The scores are used to select a content item.
