<title>
Platform for Service Providers Comprised of a Supporting Network of Peers and Shared Services
</title>

<abstract>
A platform for service providers comprised of a supporting network of peers and shared services is a software based platform that enables service providers to optimize their rates their customers pay for service and covering rates they charge for assisting peer members of the network with their customers while allowing each service provider to maintain ownership of their customers.

<claims>
1. A system, comprising: a) a server connected to a network, the server comprising: i) at least one processor; ii) a database for storing rate information; and iii) a memory operatively coupled to the processor, the memory storing program instructions that when executed by the processor, causes the processor to: 1) receive a rate request via the network; 2) determine an optimal rate for a customer depending on whether the customer is a new customer or an existing customer; 3) if the customer is an existing customer then receives an input for a new rate; 4) if the new rate is being raised then the system notifies the existing customer of the rate change via the network; 5) if the new rate is being lowered then the system checks for an at least one impacted member who will no longer match the existing customer based upon the new lower rate; 6) if the new rate is being lowered then the system warns the existing customer about the lower rate.
2. The system of claim 1 wherein, the optimal rate for a customer is determined by a machine learning model.
3. The system of claim 2 wherein, the machine learning model incorporates more than one skill level of a technical worker: a) wherein the machine learning model calculates: i) a mean rate for a service for the more than one skill level; ii) a standard deviation for the service for the more than one skill level; iii) a first, second, and third standard deviation for a normal distribution and probability; iv) a percentage for the each of the first, second, and third standard deviation; v) a percentage value of a match between the technical worker and the customer; vi) a probability for each of the more than one skill levels for the customer.
4. The system of claim 1 wherein, the account owner may confirm the rate change based upon at least one no longer matching existing customer.
5. A system comprising: a) a server connected to a network, the server comprising: i) at least one processor; ii) a database for storing rate information; and iii) a memory operatively coupled to the processor, the memory storing program instructions that when executed by the processor, causes the processor to: 1) receive a rate request via the network; 2) determine an optimal rate for a customer depending on whether the customer is a new customer or an existing customer; 3) if the customer is new customer then the system suggests an optimal rate based upon parameters from a preexisting economic model; and 4) if the suggested optimal rate is accepted by an account owner then the rate is set in a database and sent to the new customer via the network.
6. The system of claim 5 wherein the system receives an account owner's manually entered rate and rejects the suggested optimal rate.
7. The system of claim 6 wherein the system determines a likelihood of the members accepting the account owner's manually entered rate.
8. The system of claim 7 wherein the system has the ability to accept or reject the manually entered rate based upon the determination of a likelihood of the members accepting the manually entered rate.
9. A system comprising: a) a server connected to a network, the server receiving rate requests from members via the network, the server comprising: i) at least one processor; ii) a database for storing rate information; and iii) a memory operatively coupled to the processor, the memory storing program instructions that when executed by the processor, causes the processor to: 1) receive a rate request by a member via the network; 2) determine an optimal rate for a member depending on whether the customer is a new member or an existing member; 3) if the member is an existing member and the rates are being raised by the existing member then the system checks a database to determine whether at least one customer is impacted by the rate being raised; 4) if the at least one customer is impacted by the rate being raised the system warns the at least one customer about the rate being raised; 5) if the member is a new member the system suggests an optimal rate based upon parameters from a preexisting economic model; 6) if the suggested optimal rate is accepted by an the new member then the rate is set in a database.
10. The system of claim 9 wherein, the optimal rate for a customer is determined by a machine learning model.
11. The system of claim 10 wherein, the machine learning model incorporates more than one skill level of a technical worker: a) wherein the machine learning model calculates: i) a mean rate for a service for the more than one skill level; ii) a standard deviation for the service for the more than one skill level; iii) a first, second, and third standard deviation for a normal distribution and probability; iv) a percentage for the each of the first, second, and third standard deviation; v) a percentage value of a match between the technical worker and the customer; vi) a probability for each of the more than one skill levels for the member.
12. The system of claim 11 wherein, the system receives a manually entered rate rejecting the suggested optimal rate.
13. The system of claim 12 wherein, the system determines a likelihood of an at least one customer matching the manually entered rate.
14. The system of claim 13 wherein, the system has the ability to accept or reject the manually entered rate based upon the determination of a likelihood of the at least one customer accepting the manually entered rate.
