METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DEBUGGING, AND SYSTEM ON CHIP
</title>

<abstract>
Provided are a method and an apparatus for debugging, and a system on chip. The method for debugging includes: a component to be debugged receives a debugging instruction from a controller, and the component to be debugged performs debugging operation according to the debugging instruction and configuration of a state machine inside the component to be debugged. Then an SW level debugging operation of component on system on chip can be achieved, which improves the debugging efficiency of these components with large amounts of data flow on system on chip.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for debugging, comprising: receiving, by a component to be debugged, a debugging instruction from a controller; performing, by the component to be debugged, debugging operation according to the debugging instruction and configuration of a state machine inside the component to be debugged.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the debugging instruction comprises a first debugging instruction indicating breakpoint at a first position; wherein the performing, by the component to be debugged, debugging operation comprises: executing, by the component to be debugged, the debugging operation till the first position according to the configuration of the state machine; suspending, by the component to be debugged, the debugging operation at the first position according to the configuration of the state machine; and transmitting, by the component to be debugged, a first information indicating hitting of the breakpoint at the first position to the controller, according to the configuration of the state machine.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein the debugging instruction comprises a second debugging instruction indicating stepping at a second position; wherein the performing, by the component to be debugged, debugging operation comprises: executing, by the component to be debugged, the debugging operation at the second position according to the configuration of the state machine.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein the debugging instruction comprises a third debugging instruction indicating resuming the debugging operation; wherein the performing, by the component to be debugged, debugging operation comprises: resuming, by the component to be debugged, the debugging operation according to the configuration of the state machine.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the component to be debugged comprises an accelerator running a deep neural network (DNN).
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the first position comprises tile Y of layer X or layer X, wherein X and Y are positive integer greater than 1, the second position is tile Y+1 or layer X+1.
7. A method for debugging, comprising: transmitting, by a controller, a debugging instruction to a component to be debugged; reading, by the controller, debugging information from the component to be debugged, wherein the debugging information is generated according to the debugging instruction and configuration of a state machine inside the component to be debugged.
8. The method according to claim 7, wherein the debugging instruction comprises a first debugging instruction indicating breakpoint at a first position; wherein before the reading, by the controller, debugging information from the component to be debugged, the method further comprising: receiving, by the controller, a first information indicating hitting of the breakpoint at the first position, from the component to be debugged.
9. The method according to claim 7, wherein: the debugging instruction comprises a second debugging instruction indicating stepping at a second position; or the debugging instruction comprises a third debugging instruction indicating resuming the debugging operation.
