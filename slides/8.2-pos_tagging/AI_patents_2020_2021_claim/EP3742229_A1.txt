<title>
SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ADJUSTING PREDICTION MODELS BETWEEN FACILITY LOCATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
Described herein is a method for adjusting a prediction model used for enhancing a lithography process. The method comprises providing (400) an initial prediction model (401) comprising a plurality of model parameters to one or more remote locations (404). The method comprises training (420) the initial prediction model with local data (406) at the one or more remote locations (404) such that at least one model parameter (W) is updated (450,454,454). The method comprises receiving (460) the at least one updated model parameter from each of the one or more remote locations where the initial prediction model was trained. The method comprises determining aggregated updated model parameters based on the at least one updated model parameter received from the one or more remote locations. The method comprises adjusting the initial prediction model based on the aggregated updated model parameters. The adjusted prediction model is operable to enhance the lithography process.

<claims>
1. A method for adjusting a lithography process, the method comprising: providing an initial prediction model comprising a plurality of model parameters to one or more remote locations; training the initial prediction model with local data at the one or more remote locations such that at least one model parameter is updated; receiving the at least one updated model parameter from each of the one or more remote locations where the initial prediction model was trained; determining aggregated updated model parameters based on the at least one updated model parameter received from the one or more remote locations; and adjusting the initial prediction model based on the aggregated updated model parameters, the adjusted prediction model being operable to enhance the lithography process.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one model parameter comprises a weight.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, further comprising, prior to providing the initial prediction model to the one or more remote locations, training the initial prediction model using global data, the global data comprising a larger data set than the local data, the global data being associated with more than one of the remote locations,
such that the training of the initial prediction model with local data at the one or more remote locations comprises retraining the initial prediction model to update the at least one model parameter.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein training the initial prediction model using global data comprises training the initial prediction model with image data associated with a reticle or collector, and defect information associated with contamination or image performance.
5. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the prediction model is a neural network and wherein the at least one model parameter comprises a weight and a bias of the neural network.
6. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the adjusted prediction model being operable to enhance the lithography process comprises the adjusted prediction model being used to determine whether collector contamination is at an acceptable level for an exposure in the lithography process.
7. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the one or more remote locations comprise one or more facility locations remote from a facility location where the initial prediction model is generated and trained, the updated model parameters are received, the aggregated updated model parameters are determined, and the adjusted prediction model is determined.
8. The method of any preceding claim, further comprising iteratively providing the adjusted prediction model to the one or more remote locations, receiving the updated model parameters, determining the aggregated updated model parameters, and readjusting the adjusted prediction model until a stop condition is satisfied.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the stop condition comprises convergence of the readjusted prediction model.
10. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the initial prediction model comprises a partially trained prediction model, the partially trained prediction model comprising the plurality of model parameters such that, after provision to a given remote location, the training with local data comprises fully training the initial prediction model.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein a user at the given remote location determines, based on the fully trained initial prediction model, whether to communicate the updated at least one model parameter from the given remote location.
12. A method for adjusting a prediction model comprising a plurality of model parameters, the method comprising: providing local training data associated with a semiconductor manufacturing process to the prediction model to determine first updated model parameter values; receiving second updated model parameter values obtained by providing the prediction model at least partially with external training data; and adjusting the prediction model based on an expected improvement of a prediction model accuracy, wherein the adjusting comprises updating the model parameters with the first updated model parameter values and/or second updated model parameter values.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the plurality of model parameters comprise a weight, the first updated model parameter values include a first updated weight value, and the second updated model parameter values include a second updated weight value.
14. The method of claim 12 or 13, further comprising, prior to providing the local training data to the prediction model, training the prediction model using global data, the global data comprising a larger data set than the local training data, the global data being associated with more than one of the remote locations.
such that providing the local training data comprises retraining the prediction model to determine the first updated model parameter values.
15. The method of any of claims 12 to 14, further comprising providing the prediction model to a remote location, the remote location comprising a facility location remote from a facility location where the prediction model is generated, the remote location comprising the facility location where: the local training data associated with the semiconductor manufacturing process is provided to the prediction model to determine the first updated model parameter values; the second updated model parameter values are received; and the prediction model is adjusted.
