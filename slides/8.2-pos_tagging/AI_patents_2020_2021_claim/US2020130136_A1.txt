CHEMICAL MECHANICAL POLISHING APPARATUS AND METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure describes an apparatus and a method to detect a polishing pad profile during a polish process and adjust the polishing process based on the detected profile. The apparatus can include a polishing pad configured to polishing a substrate, a substrate carrier configured to hold the substrate against the polishing pad, and a detection module configured to detect a profile of the polishing pad. The detection module can include a probe configured to measure a thickness of one or more areas on the polishing pad, and a beam configured to support the probe, where the probe can be further configured to move along the beam.

<claims>
1. An apparatus for polishing a substrate, comprising: a polishing pad configured to polish the substrate; a substrate carrier configured to hold the substrate against the polishing pad; and a detection module configured to detect a profile of the polishing pad, wherein the detection module comprises: a probe configured to measure a thickness of one or more areas on the polishing pad; and a beam configured to support the probe, wherein the probe is further configured to move along the beam.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a slurry dispenser configured to dispense a CMP slurry onto a surface of the polishing pad, wherein the detection module is attached to the slurry dispenser.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a pad conditioner configured to condition the polishing pad, wherein the detection module is attached to the pad conditioner.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the detection module further comprises a base configured to support the beam, and wherein the base is positioned adjacent to the polishing pad.
5. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the beam is further configured to extend over the polishing pad, and sweep across a surface of the polishing pad.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the detection module is configured to detect the profile of the polishing pad during a polishing process.
7. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the probe comprises an optical module configured to transmit and receive one or more optical signals associated with thickness measurements of the one or more areas on the polishing pad.
8. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the probe comprises an acoustic module configured to transmit and receive one or more acoustic signals associated with thickness measurements of the one or more areas on the polishing pad.
9. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the probe comprises a contact probe configured to sense a mechanical pressure signal associated with thickness measurements of the one or more areas on the polishing pad.
10. A method for operating a polishing system, comprising: determining a profile of one or more areas of a polishing pad of a polishing system during a polishing process; comparing the profile to a reference profile; and adjusting one or more parameters of the polishing process based on the comparison.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the determining the profile comprises collecting thickness data associated with the one or more areas of the polishing pad.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein the determining the profile comprises measuring a thickness of one or more areas of the polishing pad while the polishing pad is rotating.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein the comparing the profile to the reference profile comprises comparing the profile to a simulated profile generated by a mathematical process, a machine learning process, a big data mining process, or a neural network process.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein the polishing process comprises a substrate polishing process or a conditioning process.
15. The method of claim 10, wherein the adjusting the one or more parameters comprises adjusting at least one of a rotation speed of the polishing pad, a substrate carrier of the polishing system, a rotation speed of the substrate carrier, a pressure applied by the substrate carrier, a flow rate of a slurry supply of the polishing system, a location of the slurry supply, a location of a conditioner of the polishing system, a rotation speed of the conditioner, and a pressure applied by the conditioner.
16.
