SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR OBTAINING DOWNHOLE FLUID PROPERTIES
</title>

<abstract>
A downhole fluid analysis device (42) includes a piezoelectric helm resonator (92), an optical sensor (94) positioned co-located with respect to the piezoelectric helm resonator (92), and a spectroscopy sensor (96) positioned symmetrically with respect to the piezoelectric helm resonator (92) in at least one direction. The piezoelectric helm resonator (92) includes a strain bar (98), a pair of electrodes (110) coupled to the strain bar (98), and a pair of tines (106,108), coupled to the ends of the strain bar (98), in which strain across a transverse face of the strain bar (98) generates a resonance response from the pair of tines (106, 108).
