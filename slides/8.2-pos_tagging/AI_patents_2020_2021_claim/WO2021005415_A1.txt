METHOD FOR OPERATING AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE IN ORDER TO BROWSE THROUGH PHOTOS
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a method for operating an electronic device (1) characterized in that it comprises the following steps, performed by a processing unit (11) of the device (1): determining (b) that a first image, selected for being displayed at the interface (13), depicts at least a first object of interest; and displaying (c), at the interface (13), said first image automatically zoomed in on said first object of interest.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for operating an electronic device (1 ) characterized in that it comprises the following steps, performed by a processing unit (11 ) of the device (1 ):
determining (b) that a first image, selected for being displayed at the interface (13), depicts at least a first object of interest; and
displaying (c), at the interface (13), said first image automatically zoomed in on said first object of interest.
2. The method according to claim 1 , further comprising detecting (a) an image selection action at the interface (13), the display of said image automatically zoomed in on said first object of interest being triggered by the detection of the image selection action.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein said interface (13) is a touch-sensitive screen and said image selection action is an action among a swipe touch gesture performed on a previous image in a group of images whereof said first image belongs to or a touch gesture on a thumbnail picture of said image in an album object displayed at said interface (13).
4. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, further comprising detecting (d) a zoom adjustment action at said interface
(13) and adjusting (e) at least one zoom parameter used for automatically zooming in on the first object of interest, depending on said zoom adjustment action. 5. The method according to claim 4, wherein said interface
(13) is a touch-sensitive screen and said zoom adjustment action is a pinch in or pinch out gesture for adjusting a zoom ratio used for automatically zooming in on the first object of interest or a sliding gesture for adjusting a focal point used for automatically zooming in on the first object of interest. 6. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, further comprising detecting (d") an image swapping action at said interface (13) and performing the determining (b) and displaying (c) steps for a second image selected following said image swapping action.
7. The method according to claim 6, wherein said interface (13) is a touch-sensitive screen and said image selection action is a touch gesture by the user, in particular a fast swipe gesture.
8. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein, when it is determined that said image depicts a plurality of objects of interest including said first object of interest and a second object of interest, the method further comprises selecting (d ) the first object of interest among the plurality of objects of interest before displaying (c) said image automatically zoomed in on said first object of interest.
9. The method according to claim 8, further comprising detecting (d') an object of interest swapping action at said interface (13) and displaying (f) at the interface (13) said first image automatically zoomed in on the second object of interest.
10. The method according to claim 9, wherein said interface (13) is a touch-sensitive screen and said object of interest swapping action is a touch gesture by the user, in particular a slow swipe touch gesture.
11. The method according to any one of claims 9 and 10, further comprising selecting (f1 ) the second object of interest among the plurality of objects of interest before displaying (f) said image automatically zoomed in on the second object of interest.
12. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 11 , wherein a zoom ratio applied during the display of an image automatically zoomed in on an object of interest is function of the size of an area containing said first or second object of interest and the total size of the first image.
13. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 12, comprising detecting a zoom cancelling action on said interface (13) and displaying at the interface (13) said first image without any zooming in on an object of interest.
14. An electronic device (1 ) comprising a processing unit (11 ) and an interface (13), characterized in that the processing unit (11 ) is configured to implement:
determining (b) that a first image, selected for being displayed at the interface (13), depicts at least a first object of interest; and
displaying (c), at the interface (13), said first image automatically zoomed in on said first object of interest.
15. A computer program product, comprising code instructions for executing the method according to any one of claims 1 to 13 for operating an electronic device (1 ).
16. A computer-readable medium, on which is stored a computer program product comprising code instructions for executing the method according to any one of claims 1 to 13 for operating an electronic device (1 ).
