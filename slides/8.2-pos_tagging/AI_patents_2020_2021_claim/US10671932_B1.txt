Software application selection models integration
</title>

<abstract>
A method for recommendation model integration includes obtaining, using a first model, multiple text scores ranking multiple software applications according to a first user submitted terms in a source software application, and obtaining, using a second model, multiple feature scores ranking the software applications according to multiple features of the software applications. The method further includes integrating the text scores and the feature scores to generate multiple combined scores for the software applications, and presenting, to a user, the software applications according to the combined scores.
