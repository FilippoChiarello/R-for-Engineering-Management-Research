METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT TRANSITION ELEMENTS
</title>

<abstract>
Transitional elements to offset a capacitive impedance in a transmission line are disclosed. Described are various examples of transitional elements in a multilayer substrate that introduce a transitional reactance to cancel the transmission line capacitive effects. The transitional elements reduce insertion loss.
