SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR MANAGING A DATABASE BACK END AS A SERVICE
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for managing a database back end as a service are described. In some aspects, the described systems and methods provide for a cloud-based resource for servicing a request for data from an application to a remote database and/or a service. In some aspects, the described systems and methods provide for a cloud-based application client for requesting data from a remote database and/or a service.

<claims>
1. 1.-22. (canceled)
23. A cloud-based resource for servicing a request from a cloud-based application to access data from a remote database, comprising: a processor configured to: receive, from a cloud-based application, a request to access data from a remote database; determine, from the request, a user identification and one or more fields to be accessed for a read or write operation; apply a first set of rules to determine whether the cloud-based application is allowed to access the one or more fields based on whether a user role associated with the user identification is authorized to request the read or write operation; and in response to determining that the cloud-based application is allowed to access the one or more fields: transmit, based on the request and the one or more fields, a database request to the remote database; access, at the cloud-based resource, one or more results from the remote database responsive to the database request when the cloud-based resource determines using a second set of rules that the cloud-based application is allowed to access the one or more results from the remote database based on whether the one or more results are locked from being accessed by the cloud-based application; and transmit the one or more results to the cloud-based application.
24. The cloud-based resource of claim 23, wherein the request includes a declarative statement to determine one or more parameters for the first set of rules and/or the second set of rules.
25. The cloud-based resource of claim 24, wherein the declarative statement includes code for executing the request, the code including the read or write operation, the one or more fields, and/or the user identification.
26. The cloud-based resource of claim 24, wherein the request from the cloud-based application is parsed to determine the one or more parameters by translating a raw expression for the declarative statement from the request into a general match expression.
27. The cloud-based resource of claim 25, wherein translating the raw expression for the declarative statement from the request into the general match expression comprises interpolating the raw expression from the request to replace one or more placeholders in the raw expression with corresponding values.
28. The cloud-based resource of claim 26, wherein translating the raw expression for the declarative statement from the request into the general match expression further comprises converting the interpolated expression into the general match expression.
29. The cloud-based resource of claim 27, wherein translating the raw expression for the declarative statement from the request into the general match expression further comprises evaluating the general match expression against a value.
30. The cloud-based resource of claim 23, wherein transmitting, based on the request and the one or more fields, the database request to the remote database comprises transmitting the database request to the remote database, and, based on a response from the remote database, transmitting the service request to a service.
31. A method for a cloud-based resource for servicing a request from a cloud-based application to access data from a remote database, comprising: receiving, from a cloud-based application, a request to access data from a remote database; determining, from the request, a user identification and one or more fields to be accessed for a read or write operation; applying a first set of rules to determine whether the cloud-based application is allowed to access the one or more fields based on whether a user role associated with the user identification is authorized to request the read or write operation; and in response to determining that the cloud-based application is allowed to access the one or more fields: transmitting, based on the request and the one or more fields, a database request to the remote database; accessing, at the cloud-based resource, one or more results from the remote database responsive to the database request when the cloud-based resource determines using a second set of rules that the cloud-based application is allowed to access the one or more results from the remote database based on whether the one or more results are locked from being accessed by the cloud-based application; and transmitting the one or more results to the cloud-based application.
32. The method of claim 32, wherein the request includes a declarative statement to determine one or more parameters for the first set of rules and/or the second set of rules.
33. The method of claim 33, wherein the declarative statement includes code for executing the request, the code including the read or write operation, the one or more fields, and/or the user identification.
34. The method of claim 33, wherein the request from the cloud-based application is parsed to determine the one or more parameters by translating a raw expression for the declarative statement from the request into a general match expression.
35. The method of claim 34, wherein translating the raw expression for the declarative statement from the request into the general match expression comprises interpolating the raw expression from the request to replace one or more placeholders in the raw expression with corresponding values.
36. The method of claim 35, wherein translating the raw expression for the declarative statement from the request into the general match expression further comprises converting the interpolated expression into the general match expression.
37. The method of claim 36, wherein translating the raw expression for the declarative statement from the request into the general match expression further comprises evaluating the general match expression against a value.
38. The method of claim 31, wherein transmitting, based on the request and the one or more fields, the database request to the remote database comprises transmitting the database request to the remote database, and, based on a response from the remote database, transmitting the service request to a service.
