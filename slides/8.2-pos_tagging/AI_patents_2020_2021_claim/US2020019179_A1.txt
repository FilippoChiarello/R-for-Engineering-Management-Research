METHOD FOR OPERATING A MOTOR VEHICLE IN A NAVIGATION SURROUNDING AREA, AND MOTOR VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
The disclosure relates to a method for operating a motor vehicle in a navigation surrounding area, in particular in a parking surrounding area. A digital navigation map, which describes a roadway grid, of the navigation surrounding area is used, and a navigation route to a destination contained in the navigation map is ascertained by a navigation system of the motor vehicle while taking into consideration the navigation map. Sensor data which describes the environment of the motor vehicle is ascertained by means of a motor vehicle sensor device, and the navigation system carries out a vehicle guidance algorithm which uses the sensor data as input data and is trained by means of a machine learning process using training data. The motor vehicle is guided at least temporarily along the navigation route automatically according to at least one lateral and/or longitudinal guidance action ascertained by the vehicle guidance algorithm on the basis of the input data.

1. 1.-10. (canceled)
11. A method for operating a motor vehicle in a navigation environment, comprising: applying a digital navigation map of the navigation environment, wherein the digital navigation map describes a roadway network; determining, by a navigation system of the motor vehicle, a navigation route to a target position contained in the digital navigation map, taking account of the digital navigation map; providing, by a sensor device on the motor vehicle side, sensor data, wherein the sensor data describe the surroundings of the motor vehicle; training, by means of machine learning, a vehicle guidance algorithm on the basis of training data, wherein the vehicle guidance algorithm uses the sensor data as input data; implementing, by the navigation system, the vehicle guidance algorithm; and guiding, automatically, the motor vehicle along the navigation route according to a transverse or longitudinal guidance action determined by the vehicle guidance algorithm.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the navigation environment comprises a parking environment.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the training of the vehicle guidance algorithm includes performing at a factory, on the basis of training data that describe movements of the motor vehicle within a reference navigation environment.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein the training of the vehicle guidance algorithm includes performing with respect to preventing collisions.
15. The method of claim 11, wherein the training of the vehicle guidance algorithm includes performing with respect to implementing a movement of the motor vehicle in accordance with a requirement to drive on a right-hand side or on a left-hand side of a road.
16. The method of claim 11, further comprising: receiving, prior to the automatically guiding of the motor vehicle, a control action wherein the control action is carried out by a driver and indicates a desire for automatic guidance.
17. The method of claim 16, further comprising: checking, by the vehicle guidance algorithm, on the basis of the sensor data, whether the determination of a future transverse or longitudinal guidance action is available; and issuing, in the event of availability being determined, a notification to the driver, indicating that the control action can be accepted.
18. The method of claim 11, further comprising: selecting, by the vehicle guidance algorithm, in the event of a plurality of options being determined for a future transverse or longitudinal guidance action, in particular for a travel direction decision, one option on the basis of the navigation route or a control action that is carried out by a driver and indicates a desired transverse or longitudinal guidance action.
19. The method of claim 11, further comprising: implementing, by the navigation system, a collision prevention algorithm, wherein the collision prevention algorithm uses the sensor data as input data and modifies or prevents the transverse or longitudinal guidance action determined by the vehicle guidance algorithm if an imminent collision of the motor vehicle with an obstacle is detected.
20. The method of claim 11, wherein the sensor device comprises an ultrasonic sensor, a radar sensor, a laser sensor or a camera, and provides raw data; and the sensor data describes an environment model of the motor vehicle that is derived from the raw data.
21. The method of claim 11, further comprising: terminating the automatic guidance of the motor vehicle when the target position is reached or in the event of a control action that is carried out by a driver and indicates a desire to terminate the automatic guidance.
22. A motor vehicle, comprising: a sensor device, configured to provide sensor data, wherein the sensor data describe the surroundings of the motor vehicle; and a navigation system, configured to determine a navigation route to a target position contained in a navigation map, and implement a vehicle guidance algorithm, wherein the vehicle guidance algorithm is trained by means of machine learning using the sensor data as input data and is configured to determine a transverse or longitudinal guidance action; and the motor vehicle is guided automatically along the navigation route according to the transverse or longitudinal guidance action.
