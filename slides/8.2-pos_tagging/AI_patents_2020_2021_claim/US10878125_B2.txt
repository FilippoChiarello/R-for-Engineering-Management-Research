Privacy protection based training sample generation method and device
</title>

<abstract>
A privacy protection based training sample generation method includes: generating n d-dimensional transform vectors π from original data to be mined, wherein the original data comprises m original samples, each original sample includes a d-dimensional original vector x and an output tag value y, m and d being natural numbers, and each transform vector π is determined by a sum of yx of a plurality of original samples randomly selected from the m original samples; and determining the n transform vectors π as training samples of a binary classification model.
