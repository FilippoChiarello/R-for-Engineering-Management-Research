CONTROL UNIT FOR DERIVING A MEASURE OF ARTERIAL COMPLIANCE
</title>

<abstract>
A control unit (12) and method for deriving a measure of arterial compliance based on an acquired arterial volume variation signal and measured diastolic and systolic blood pressure measurements. An oscillometric blood pressure measurement device is used to obtain a first signal representative of arterial volume variations and to obtain blood pressure measurements. Both are measured as an applied pressure to an artery is varied by the oscillometric blood pressure measurement device. The first signal is processed to compile a dataset of values, ΔV, representative of the change in the arterial volume for set step changes, ΔP, in applied pressure, at different transmural pressure values. This set of values is numerically integrated to derive a function of arterial volume with transmural pressure. This function is differentiated to thereby derive a function of arterial compliance with transmural pressure.
