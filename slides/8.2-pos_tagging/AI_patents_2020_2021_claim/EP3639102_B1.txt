</title>

<abstract>
Controlling marine vessel: obtaining (302) motion data (300) related to the marine vessel; obtaining (317) an operation state (112) related to one or more apparatuses (102) exerting force from the marine vessel to ambient water; detecting (312) a disturbance (140) in one or more degrees of freedom affecting the marine vessel based on the motion data (300); and determining (326) control data (114) for the one or more apparatuses (102) exerting force to attenuate the detected disturbance (140).
