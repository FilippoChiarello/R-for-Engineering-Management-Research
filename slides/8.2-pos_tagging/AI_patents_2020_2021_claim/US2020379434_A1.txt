<title>
AUTOMATIC CONTROL LOOP DECISION VARIATION
</title>

<abstract>
A method includes defining a plurality of variables to modify in a control loop; Collecting first data using a first variable of the plurality of variables while executing the control loop, generating a first result based on the collecting first data step, substituting a second variable of the plurality of variables for the first variable, collecting second data using the second variable while executing the control loop, generating a second result based on the collecting second data step, comparing the first result and the second result; and taking an action based on the comparing step.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising: defining a plurality of variables to modify in a control loop; collecting first data using a first variable of the plurality of variables while executing the control loop; generating a first result based on the collecting first data step; substituting a second variable of the plurality of variables for the first variable; collecting second data using the second variable while executing the control loop; generating a second result based on the collecting second data step; comparing the first result and the second result; and taking an action based on the comparing step.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the taking step comprises publishing the first result and the second result.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein the plurality of variables comprises modifying the processing order of functions executed in the control loop.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein the plurality of variables comprises two or more threshold values and the taking step comprises selecting one of the two or more threshold values to use when executing the control loop.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the plurality of variables comprises variables used to scale an operation and the taking step scales the application based on the comparing step.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein the plurality of variables comprises variables that simulate failures and the method further comprises analyzing the reconfigurability of a system based on the simulated failures.
7. The method of claim 1 further comprising repeating the substituting step, collecting step, generating step and comparing step for additional variables of the plurality of variables.
8. The method of claim 7 further comprising setting a threshold value and wherein the repeating step is halted based on calculations in the control loop exceeding the threshold value.
9. The method of claim 7 wherein the repeating step is performed periodically.
10. The method of claim 7 wherein the repeating step is performed for a set period of time.
11. A method comprising: configuring a decision recipe; executing a control loop using a first variable from the decision recipe; collecting data based on the executing step; analyzing the collected data to form a first result; determining whether there are additional variables available in the decision recipe; and if there are additional variables available, then substituting an additional variable for the first variable and repeating the executing, collecting and analyzing steps to form additional results.
12. The method of claim 11 further comprising grading the first result and the additional results.
13. The method of claim 12 wherein the grading is based on performance results.
14. The method of claim 12 wherein the grading is based on conformance to policies.
15. The method of claim 11 further comprising taking an action based on the first result and the additional results.
16. The method of claim 15 further comprising comparing the first result and the additional results to determine an optimized variation and wherein the action includes using the optimized variation during operation of a platform.
17. A control loop for a platform comprising: a decision recipe design module; a data collection module configured to collect data from operation of platform; an input-output interface; a processor coupled to the input-output interface wherein the processor is coupled to a memory, the memory having stored thereon executable instructions that when executed by the processor cause the processor to effectuate operations comprising: executing the control loop using a first variable retrieved from the decision recipe design module; analyzing the collected data to form a first result; determining whether there are additional variables available from the decision recipe design module; and if there are additional variables available, then substituting an additional variable for the first variable and repeating the executing, collecting and analyzing steps to form additional results.
18. The apparatus of claim 17 wherein the operations further comprise comparing the first result and the additional results to determine an optimized variation and wherein the action includes using the optimized variation during operation of the platform.
19. The apparatus of claim 17 wherein the decision recipe comprises a set of variables based on policies.
20. The apparatus of claim 17 wherein the decision recipe comprises a set of thresholds and the operations further comprise determine an optimum threshold from the set of thresholds for operation of the platform.
