<title>
Apparatus and method of generating machine learning-based cyber sickness prediction model for virtual reality content
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is an apparatus and method of generating a VR sickness prediction model. A method of generating a VR sickness prediction model according to the present disclosure includes: displaying virtual reality content on a display unit; detecting first VR sickness information of a user who experiences the virtual reality content using a sensor; determining second VR sickness information using a user input that is input from the user in response to a request for inputting a degree of VR sickness for the virtual reality content; performing machine learning based on supervised learning using VR sickness-inducing factors for the virtual reality content, the first VR sickness information, and the second VR sickness information; and determining a correlation between the VR sickness-inducing factors and a list of VR sickness symptoms on a basis of the performed machine learning.

<claims>
1. A method of generating a VR sickness prediction model, the method comprising: displaying virtual reality content on a display unit; detecting first VR sickness information of a user who experiences the virtual reality content using a sensor, the first VR sickness information including a change in at least one of a posture, a facial expression, a gesture, and a voice of the user; determining second VR sickness information using a user input that is input from the user in response to a request for inputting a degree of VR sickness for the virtual reality content; performing machine learning based on supervised learning using VR sickness-inducing factors for the virtual reality content, the first VR sickness information, and the second VR sickness information; and determining a correlation between the VR sickness-inducing factors and a list of VR sickness symptoms on a basis of the performed machine learning, wherein the VR sickness-inducing factors of the virtual reality content includes at least one of binocular parallax and depth of field, wherein the determining of the correlation between the VR sickness-inducing factors and the list of VR sickness symptoms includes: determining a quantitative correlation between the VR sickness-inducing factors and the list of VR sickness symptoms, by causing at least one of items in the list of VR sickness symptoms to be gradually changed in magnitude as the VR sickness-inducing factors for the virtual reality content change, and wherein the performing of the machine learning based on supervised learning includes: determining a feature vector acquired using the first VR sickness information as data in the machine learning based on supervised learning; determining the second VR sickness information as a label for the data in the machine learning based on supervised learning; and performing the machine learning based on supervised learning using the data and the label for the data.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the list of VR sickness symptoms includes at least one of discomfort, fatigue, headache, eye fatigue, difficulties with focusing, sweating, nausea, difficulties with attention, brain fog, visual acuity, dizziness, hallucinations, stomachache, cyber sickness, burping, and other symptoms.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein the sensor includes at least one of an image capturing sensor and a biological signal detection sensor; the first VR sickness information is at least one of an image of the user acquired from the image capturing sensor and a magnitude of biological signal of the user acquired from the biological signal detection sensor; and the second VR sickness information is a degree of at least one of the items in the list of VR sickness symptoms input from the user in response to the request for inputting the degree of the VR sickness for the virtual reality content.
4. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: displaying the correlation between the determined VR sickness-inducing factors and the list of VR sickness symptoms on a display unit using a graphical user interface GUI.
5. The method according to claim 1, further comprising: predicting the correlation between the VR sickness-inducing factors and the list of VR sickness symptoms for given virtual reality content on a basis of the performed machine learning.
6. An apparatus for generating a VR sickness prediction model, the apparatus comprising: a display unit displaying virtual reality content; a user input unit; and a control unit detecting first VR sickness information of a user who experiences the virtual reality content using a sensor, determining second VR sickness information using a user input that is input from the user in response to a request for inputting a degree of VR sickness for the virtual reality content, performing machine learning based on supervised learning using VR sickness-inducing factors for the virtual reality content, the first VR sickness information, and the second VR sickness information, and determining a correlation between the VR sickness-inducing factors and a list of VR sickness symptoms on a basis of the performed machine learning, wherein the first VR sickness information includes a change in at least one of a posture, a facial expression, a gesture, and a voice of the user, and wherein the VR sickness-inducing factors of the virtual reality content includes at least one of binocular parallax and depth of field, wherein the control unit determines a quantitative correlation between the VR sickness-inducing factors and the list of VR sickness symptoms, by causing at least one of items in the list of VR sickness symptoms to be gradually changed in magnitude as the VR sickness-inducing factors for the virtual reality content change, and wherein the control unit determines a feature vector acquired using the first VR sickness information as data in the machine learning based on supervised learning, determines the second VR sickness information as a label for the data in the machine learning based on supervised learning, and performs the machine learning based on supervised learning using the data and the label for the data.
7. The apparatus according to claim 6, wherein the list of VR sickness symptoms includes at least one of discomfort, fatigue, headache, eye fatigue, difficulties with focusing, sweating, nausea, difficulties with attention, brain fog, visual acuity, dizziness, hallucinations, stomachache, cyber sickness, burping, and other symptoms.
8. The apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the sensor includes at least one of an image capturing sensor and a biological signal detection sensor; the first VR sickness information is at least one of an image of the user acquired from the image capturing sensor and a magnitude of biological signal of the user acquired from the biological signal detection sensor; and the second VR sickness information is a degree of at least one of the items in the list of VR sickness symptoms input from the user in response to the request for inputting the degree of the VR sickness for the virtual reality content.
9. The apparatus according to claim 6, wherein the control unit displays the correlation between the determined VR sickness-inducing factors and the list of VR sickness symptoms on a display unit using a graphical user interface GUI.
10. The apparatus according to claim 6, wherein the control unit predicts the correlation between the VR sickness-inducing factors and the list of VR sickness symptoms for given virtual reality content on a basis of the performed machine learning.
