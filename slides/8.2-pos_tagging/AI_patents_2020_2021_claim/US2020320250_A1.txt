Systems and Methods for Generating Logical Documents for a Document Evaluation System
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for generating logical documents for a document evaluation system are provided. For example, a method for generating logical documents for a document evaluation system includes receiving a first child document associated with a master document. The master document includes one or more master terms. The first child document includes one or more first child terms and a first date. The method further includes generating a logical document based at least in part on the master document. The logical document includes one or more current document values. Each current document value corresponds to one master term and is associated with a current date and a current reference. The current reference identifies a region in the master document related to the one master term. The method further includes selecting a first child term from the one or more first child terms.

<claims>
1. A method for generating logical documents for a document evaluation system, the method comprising: receiving a first child document associated with a master document, the master document including one or more master terms, the first child document including one or more first child terms and a first date, generating a logical document based at least in part on the master document, the logical document including one or more current document values, each current document value corresponding to one master term and being associated with a current date and a current reference, the current reference identifying a region in the master document related to the one master term; selecting a first child term from the one or more first child terms; in response to identifying a master term that relates to the selected first child term: in response to determining that the scope of the first child document is equal to a global value: assigning a new document value associated with the selected first child term to the current document value corresponding to the identified master term; assigning the first date to the current date associated with the current document value corresponding to the identified master term; and changing the current reference associated with the current document value corresponding to the identified master term to a first reference, the first reference identifying a region in the first child document related to the selected first child term; and in response to determining that the scope of the first child document is not equal to the global value: adding a local document value corresponding to the selected first child term to the logical document; assigning the new document value associated with the selected first child term to the local document value; and associating the first reference and the first date with the local document value.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the generating a logical document based at least in part on the master document includes, for each master term: assigning an original document value associated with the master term to the current document value corresponding to the master term; associating a second date of the master document to the current date associated with the current document value corresponding to the master term; and generating the current reference associated with the current document value corresponding to the master term; wherein the second date relates to an effective date of the master document.
3. The method of claim 1, and further comprising: in response to not identifying any master term that relates to the selected first child term: in response to determining that the scope of the first child document is equal to the global value: adding a current document value corresponding to the selected first child term to the logical document, the added document value being associated with a current date and a current reference; assigning the new document value associated with the selected first child term to the added current document value; associating the first reference with the current reference of the added current document value; and associating the first date with the current date of the added current document value; and in response to determining that the scope of the first child document is not equal to the global value: adding a local document value corresponding to the selected first child term to the logical document; assigning the new document value associated with the selected first child term to the local document value; and associating the first reference and the first date with the local document value.
4. The method of claim 1, and further comprising: adding a historical document value corresponding to the identified master term to the logical document, the historical document value being associated with a historical date and a historical reference; assigning the current document value corresponding to the identified master term to the historical document value prior to the assigning a new document value associated with the selected first child term to the current document value corresponding to the identified master term; assigning the current date associated with the current document value corresponding to the identified master term to the historical date prior to the assigning the first date to the current date associated with the current document value corresponding to the identified master term; and assigning the current reference associated with the current document value corresponding to the identified master term to the historical reference prior to the changing the current reference associated with the current document value corresponding to the identified master term to a first reference; wherein the first date relates to an effective date of the first child document.
5. The method of claim 1, and further comprising: receiving a second child document associated with the master document, the second child document including one or more second child terms and a second date; identifying a second child term of the one or more second child terms that relates to the identified master term; in response to identifying a second child term of the one or more second terms that relates to the identified master term: in response to determining that the scope of the second child document is equal to the global value and the second date is later than the current date associated with the current document value corresponding to the identified master term: assigning a new document value associated with the identified second child term to the current document value corresponding to the identified master term; assigning the second date to the current date associated with the current document value corresponding to the identified master term; and changing the current reference associated with the current document value corresponding to the identified master term to a second reference, the second reference identifying a region in the second child document related to the identified second child term.
6. The method of claim 5, and further comprising: adding a historical document value corresponding to the identified master term to the logical document, the historical document value being associated with a historical date and a historical reference; assigning the current document value corresponding to the identified master term to the historical document value prior to the assigning a new document value associated with the identified second child term to the current document value corresponding to the identified master term; assigning the current date associated with the current document value corresponding to the identified master term to the historical date prior to the assigning the second date to the current date associated with the current document value corresponding to the identified master term; and assigning the current reference associated with the current document value corresponding to the identified master term to the historical reference prior to the changing the current reference associated with the current document value corresponding to the identified master term to a second reference; wherein the second date relates to an effective date of the second child document.
7. The method of claim 5, and further comprising: in response to determining that the scope of the second child document is equal to the global value and the second date is equal to or earlier than the current date associated with the current document value corresponding to the identified master term: adding a historical document value corresponding to the identified master term to the logical document, the historical document value being associated with a historical date and a historical reference; assigning the new document value associated with the identified second child term to the historical document value; assigning the second date to the historical date; and assigning the second reference to the historical reference; wherein the second date relates to an effective date of the second child document.
8. The method of claim 5, and further comprising: in response to determining that the scope of the second child document is not equal to the global value: adding a local document value corresponding to the identified second child term to the logical document; assigning the new document value associated with the identified second child term to the local document value; and associating the second reference and the second date with the local document value.
