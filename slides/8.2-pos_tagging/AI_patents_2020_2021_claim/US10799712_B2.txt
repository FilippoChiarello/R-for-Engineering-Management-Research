<title>
Systems and methods for targeted deep hyperthermia by time-shared RF inductive applicators
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure provides, inter alia, a system and methods for targeted hyperthermia effective to differentially heat target organs. In certain embodiments, the system and/or method utilizes one or more pairs of inductive applicators coupled to the one or more RF generators and configured to deposit radio frequency radiation on a region of interest based on a set of configurable parameters.

<claims>
1. A system for targeted hyperthermia, the system comprising: one or more radio frequency (RF) generators; one or more pairs of inductive applicators coupled to the one or more RF generators and configured to deposit radio frequency radiation on a region of interest based on a set of configurable parameters; a temperature measuring device coupled to the one or more pairs of inductive applicators; and a hardware processor configured to receive temperature measurements from the temperature measuring device and cause a change on the set of configurable parameters of the one or more pairs of inductive applicators based on the received temperature measurements; wherein the one or more pairs of inductive applicators operate in Helmholtz mode and are oriented in opposite sides causing H-field coupling and deep-seated E-field penetration.
2. A system for targeted hyperthermia, the system comprising: one or more radio frequency (RF) generators; one or more pairs of inductive applicators coupled to the one or more RF generators and configured to deposit radio frequency radiation on a region of interest based on a set of configurable parameters; a temperature measuring device coupled to the one or more pairs of inductive applicators, wherein the temperature measuring device is a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) device; a hardware processor configured to receive temperature measurements from the temperature measuring device and cause a change on the set of configurable parameters of the one or more pairs of inductive applicators based on the received temperature measurements; and magnetic resonance (MR) compatible solid-state switches that switch at the point of the one or more inductive applicators in order to minimize cable matching issues.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the one or more pairs of inductive applicators and a set of MR coils of the MRI device are transparent to each other by geometric and tuned blocking circuitry.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein geometric and tuned blocking circuitry include reflective floating shields.
5. A system for targeted hyperthermia, the system comprising: one or more radio frequency (RF) generators; one or more pairs of inductive applicators coupled to the one or more RF generators and configured to deposit radio frequency radiation on a region of interest based on a set of configurable parameters; a temperature measuring device coupled to the one or more pairs of inductive applicators, wherein the temperature measuring device is a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) device; a hardware processor configured to receive temperature measurements from the temperature measuring device and cause a change on the set of configurable parameters of the one or more pairs of inductive applicators based on the received temperature measurements; and magnetic resonance (MR) compatible solid-state switches that switch inside a magnet room in order to minimize a number of cables needed to pass through a penetration panel.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the one or more pairs of inductive applicators and a set of MR coils of the MRI device are transparent to each other by geometric and tuned blocking circuitry.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein geometric and tuned blocking circuitry include reflective floating shields.
8. A system for targeted hyperthermia, the system comprising: one or more radio frequency (RF) generators; one or more pairs of inductive applicators coupled to the one or more RF generators and configured to deposit radio frequency radiation on a region of interest based on a set of configurable parameters; a temperature measuring device coupled to the one or more pairs of inductive applicators; and a hardware processor configured to receive temperature measurements from the temperature measuring device and cause a change on the set of configurable parameters of the one or more pairs of inductive applicators based on the received temperature measurements; wherein the hardware processor is configured to automatically extract and update pre-planned heat deposition patterns using real-time magnetic resonance (MR) feedback.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the pre-planned heat deposition patterns are obtained using population estimates.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the hardware processor is configured to generate a temporally-adjusted plan for the one or more pairs of inductive applicator and power for the remainder of treatment with MR feedback.
11. A system for targeted hyperthermia, the system comprising: one or more radio frequency (RF) generators; one or more pairs of inductive applicators coupled to the one or more RF generators and configured to deposit radio frequency radiation on a region of interest based on a set of configurable parameters; a temperature measuring device coupled to the one or more pairs of inductive applicators; a hardware processor configured to receive temperature measurements from the temperature measuring device and cause a change on the set of configurable parameters of the one or more pairs of inductive applicators based on the received temperature measurements; and one or more flexible articulated links enclosing the one or more pairs of inductive applicators to ensure consistent contact with a patient in order to limit the required tuning range and increase patient comfort; wherein the one or more flexible articulated links overlap creating a wide variety of patient sizes that can be accommodated with a single coil.
