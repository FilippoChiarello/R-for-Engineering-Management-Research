SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ARTIFICIAL SIGHT PROSTHETICS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for artificial sight in accordance with embodiments of the invention are illustrated. One embodiment includes a retinal prosthesis system including an external controller, a scene imager, an eye imager, an implanted controller, and a stimulation interface in communication with the implanted controller, where the stimulation interface is positioned to stimulate a plurality of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of the eye, where the external controller is configured to obtain image data describing a scene from the scene imager, obtain eye position data from the eye imager, determine a field of view (FOV) in the scene based on the eye position data; where the implanted controller is configured to obtain the FOV from the external controller, continuously select stimulation pulses from a dictionary based on the FOV, and stimulate the plurality of RGCs using the stimulation interface in accordance with the selected stimulation pulses.
