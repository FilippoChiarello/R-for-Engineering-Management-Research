TRAFFIC SIGNAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A traffic signal information management system executes a region-of-interest calculation processing to calculate, based on a position information of a vehicle and a traffic signal information indicating the position of a traffic signal, a region of interest in which a traffic signal is presumed to be present in an image imaged by the camera, and also execute a traffic signal image detection processing to detect a traffic signal image included in the region of interest. The traffic signal information management system then execute an evaluation processing to perform a comparison between the position of the region of interest calculated by the region-of-interest calculation processing and the position of the traffic signal image detected by the traffic signal image detection processing and evaluate the certainty of the traffic signal information based on the comparison.

<claims>
1. A traffic signal information management system comprising: a camera mounted on a vehicle to image a scene ahead of the vehicle in a traveling direction thereof; a computer linked to the camera; and a storage device coupled to the computer, wherein the storage device includes a traffic signal database including a traffic signal information that indicates a position of a traffic signal, and wherein the computer is configured to: execute a region-of-interest calculation processing to calculate, based on a position information of the vehicle and the traffic signal information, a region of interest in which a traffic signal is presumed to be present in an image imaged by the camera; execute a traffic signal image detection processing to detect a traffic signal image included in the region of interest; and execute an evaluation processing to perform a comparison between a position of the region of interest calculated by the region-of-interest calculation processing and a position of the traffic signal image detected by the traffic signal image detection processing and evaluate certainty of the traffic signal information based on the comparison.
2. The traffic signal information management system according to claim 1, wherein, in the evaluation processing, the computer is configured to: execute the region-of-interest calculation processing and the traffic signal image detection processing a plurality of times at different times; use a data acquired as a result of executing the region-of-interest calculation processing and the traffic signal image detection processing the plurality of times to calculate a degree of variation of the position of the traffic signal image with respect to the position of the region of interest; and calculate an evaluation value that indicates the certainty of the traffic signal information from the degree of variation.
3. The traffic signal information management system according to claim 2, wherein, in the evaluation processing, the computer is configured to calculate the evaluation value from a margin between an outer border of the region of interest and an outer border of the traffic signal image when the degree of variation is lower than or equal to a designated value.
4. The traffic signal information management system according to claim 3, wherein, in the region-of-interest calculation processing, the computer is configured to reduce, by a greater amount, a size of the region of interest calculated from the traffic signal information when the evaluation value assigned to the traffic signal information is higher.
5. The traffic signal information management system according to claim 1, wherein the computer is further configured to execute, based on a result of evaluation by the evaluation processing, a database correction processing to correct a horizontal position, height or depth of the traffic signal in the traffic signal information.
6. The traffic signal information management system according to claim 5, wherein the traffic signal information includes an arrangement of lights of the traffic signal, and wherein, in the database correction processing, the computer is configured, when the traffic signal image detected by the traffic signal image detection processing is not consistent with the arrangement of the lights in the traffic signal information, to correct, based on the traffic signal image, the arrangement of the lights in the traffic signal information.
