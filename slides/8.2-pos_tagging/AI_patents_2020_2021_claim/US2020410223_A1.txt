COMPUTER VISION SYSTEM CONFIGURED TO MONITOR AT RISK HUMANS
</title>

<abstract>
A computer vision system includes a camera that captures a plurality of image frames in a target field. A user interface is coupled to the camera. The user interface is configured to perform accelerated parallel computations in real-time on the plurality of image frames acquired by the camera. The system monitors at-risk humans.

<claims>
1. A computer vision system, comprising: a camera that captures a plurality of image frames in a target field; a processor coupled to the camera, the processor configured to receive the plurality of image frames and detect occupants in the space from the image frames, assign an ID and a location for each person in a field of view, an input image or a series of input images are processed by the processor for occupant detection and location, and occupants visible in the image are assigned IDs and locations in the image frame; a user interface that allows for a determination of a reference object including one or more of: shape, dimensions, and location in the image; a server that calculates the dimensions of the actual space shown in the input image based on the reference object information, calculates distances between any and all: detected occupants, and classifies each occupant as being within a determined-area of interest; and wherein in response to input images processed by the processor and the dimensions of the actual space the system monitors at-risk humans.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the at-risk humans are selected from at least one of: infants, children, people that are ill and the elderly.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein the system monitors wellness of at-risk humans.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the system monitors a habit of at-risk humans.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the system monitors and provide intervention for at-risk humans, and habitat/intervention.
6. The system of claim 1, further comprising: extended USB ports.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the system creates a model of the conditions of an establishment that is informed by historical data, and runs scenarios of known intervention options through the model to assess intervention options based on their cost, impact, and any other factors of interest to the establishment owner, when current conditions are observed by the system to be of interest or concern, the system generates an intervention recommendation for the establishment that is based on modeled outcomes, when a modeled intervention is employed, the system observes the impact of the intervention on the conditions, and if the observed impact is different than the modeled impact, the system updates the model based on the observed data.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein an observed impact of the intervention is compared with a modeled impact of the action, and then updates the model.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the systems provide for a continual improvement to the model.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is configured to provide a recommendation that is model directed to at least one of: an interest; and concern of the establishment.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is configured to make one or more recommendations to a human.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the system is configured to provide a mechanism by which the human can take the one or more recommendations or other action.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the other action that is modeled to best address a condition of interest to an establishment.
14. The system of claim 1, wherein the system measures at least one: conditions post an intervention; and action, and compares an observed result to the modeled result.
15. The system of claim 1, wherein the system updates a model selected from at least one of: machine learning and artificial intelligence.
16. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is used with at least one establishment selected from: retail; the food industry; and the beverage industry.
17. The system of claim 1, wherein the system is used relative to advertising costs of an establishment.
18. The system of claim 1, wherein the system provides near real time information relative to an establishment's current occupancy and provides information selected from at least one of: the ratio of an establishment's customers to employees; the number of establishment customers compared to establishment inventory; and the number of people who are entering and/or exiting an establishment.
19. The system of claim 1, wherein the system identifies a condition of interest with regard to occupant count, occupant activity, occupant location, occupant ratios, and/or some derivative or combination thereof and generates information summarizing the identified condition.
20. The system of claim 1, wherein the system sends out an alert to an establishment describing the identified condition of interest e.g. that the establishment capacity has dropped below a target capacity.
