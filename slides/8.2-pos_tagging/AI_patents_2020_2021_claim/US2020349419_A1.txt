NEURAL NETWORK ARITHMETIC PROCESSING DEVICE AND NEURAL NETWORK ARITHMETIC PROCESSING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
A neural network arithmetic processing device is capable of implementing a further increase in speed and efficiency of multiply-accumulate arithmetic operation, suppressing an increase in circuit scale, and performing multiply-accumulate arithmetic operation with simple design. A neural network arithmetic processing device includes a first multiply-accumulate arithmetic unit, a register connected to the first multiply-accumulate arithmetic unit, and a second multiply-accumulate arithmetic unit connected to the register. The first multiply-accumulate arithmetic unit has a first memory, a second memory, a first multiplier, a first adder, and a first output unit. The second multiply-accumulate arithmetic unit has an input unit, a third memory, second multipliers, second adders, and second output units.
