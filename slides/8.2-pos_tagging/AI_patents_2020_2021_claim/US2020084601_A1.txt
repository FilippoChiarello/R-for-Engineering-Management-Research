SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ANOMALY DETECTION AND SURVIVAL ANALYSIS FOR PHYSICAL ASSETS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are provided to predict failure probabilities and estimate remaining useful life in real time for physical assets such as systems or devices in a distributed fleet. Systems and methods generate models that can be used to create hazard functions based on sensor data, create survival functions based on hazard functions, and calculate variables (e.g., remaining life, time of failure) for one or more assets based on the survival functions.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: accessing sensor data related to a plurality of physical assets; generating a hazard function associated with at least one of the plurality of physical assets based on the sensor data; generating a survival function based on the hazard function; and calculating a variable associated with the at least one of the plurality of physical assets based on the survival function.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining a transient condition associated with the at least one of the plurality of physical assets from the sensor data, wherein the hazard function is based on the transient condition.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining a degradation condition associated with the at least one of the plurality of physical assets from the sensor data, wherein the variable is based on the degradation condition.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: collecting the sensor data using one or more sensors associated with one or more of the plurality of physical assets.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: aggregating the sensor data before one or both of developing the model or calculating the variable.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: supplementing the sensor data to provide for missing data by calculating a fixed value based on an average of the sensor data.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: standardizing a sensor variable of the sensor data by subtracting a mean of the sensor variable and dividing by a measure of variance of the sensor variable.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein standardizing the variable occurs before generating the hazard function.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising: updating one of the model and the variable based on additional sensor data received in real-time.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising: calculating one or more of a precision and a recall associated with the survival function.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising: tuning the survival function based on one or more of the precision or the recall.
12. The method of claim 10, further comprising: generating one or more of a priority list or a maintenance schedule associated one or more of the plurality of physical assets based on one or more of the precision or the recall and cost information.
13. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining an event associated with the variable; analyzing one or more changes to parameters associated with the physical asset; and determining a cause of the event based on the changes to the parameters.
14. A system, comprising: a hazard module configured to generate a hazard function associated with a physical asset based on sensor data from the physical asset; a survival module configured to generate a survival function based on the hazard function; and an analytics module configured to calculate a variable associated with at least one of the physical asset based on the survival function.
15. The system of claim 14, further comprising: a remediation module configured to determine an action to constrain a cost based on the variable.
16. The system of claim 14, further comprising: a component module configured to update the hazard module based on one or more of a degradation component or a transient component, wherein the degradation component or the transient component describe hazard to the physical asset.
17. The system of claim 14, further comprising: a projection module configured to project an unknown past value of the variable based on a fixed value, wherein the fixed value is based on an average of known past values.
18. The system of claim 14, further comprising: a validation module configured to validate one of the hazard function or the survival function using partitioned sensor data associated with the physical asset, wherein the partitioned sensor data is not included in the sensor data.
19. The system of claim 14, wherein the hazard module is configured to: receive additional sensor data in real-time; and update the hazard function based on the additional sensor data.
20. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that when executed by a processor effectuate operations comprising: accessing sensor data related to at least one physical asset; generating a hazard function associated with the physical asset based on the sensor data; generating a survival function associated with the physical asset based on the hazard function; and calculating a variable associated with the physical asset based on the survival function.
