APPARATUS FOR DIAGNOSING FAILURE IN VEHICLE AND CONTROL METHOD THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
A vehicle comprises: at least one module configured to determine a driving model of the vehicle; a sensor configured to obtain driving information of the vehicle; a controller configured to: determine the driving information corresponding to the driving model, determine whether the at least one module has failed or not based on a comparison of a reference value and a difference between the driving model and the driving information.

<claims>
1. A vehicle comprising: at least one module configured to determine a driving model of the vehicle; a sensor configured to obtain driving information of the vehicle; and a controller configured to: determine the driving information corresponding to the driving model, and determine whether the at least one module has failed or not based on a comparison of a reference value and a difference between the driving model and the driving information.
2. The vehicle of claim 1, further comprising a display, wherein the controller is configured to output a message to the display when determined that a failure occurs in the at least one module.
3. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the at least one module comprises an Around View Monitor (AVM) module, and wherein the controller is configured to determine whether the AVM module has failed based on a comparison between each of a lateral acceleration and a yaw rate of a driving model determined by the AVM module and a lateral acceleration and a yaw rate included in the driving information.
4. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the at least one module comprises a Global Positioning System (GPS) module, and wherein the controller is configured to determine whether the GPS module has failed based on a comparison between each of a longitudinal speed and a yaw angle of a driving model determined by the GPS module and a longitudinal speed and a yaw angle included in the driving information.
5. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the sensor comprises a wheel speed sensor and an inertial sensor.
6. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the reference value is determined based on variable values of the driving information corresponding to the driving model
7. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the sensor comprises a plurality of sensor modules, and wherein the controller is configured to determine the driving information by comparing a first state variable determined based on at least one of the plurality of sensor modules and a second state variable determined based on a remaining one or more of the plurality of sensor modules.
8. The vehicle of claim 1, wherein the controller is configured to drive the vehicle excluding the driving model generated by the at least one module when determined that a failure has occurred in the at least one module.
9. A control method of a vehicle comprising: determining a driving model of the vehicle; obtaining driving information of the vehicle; determining the driving information corresponding to the driving model; and determining whether at least one module has failed or not based on a comparison of a reference value and a difference between the driving model and the driving information.
10. The control method of claim 9 further comprising outputting a message to a display when determined that a failure occurs in the at least one module.
11. The control method of claim 9, wherein the at least one module comprises an Around View Monitor (AVM) module, and wherein the determining whether at least one module has failed comprises determining whether the AVM module has failed based on a comparison between each of a lateral acceleration and a yaw rate of a driving model determined by the AVM module and a lateral acceleration and a yaw rate included in the driving information.
12. The control method of claim 9, wherein the at least one module comprises a Global Positioning System (GPS) module, and wherein the determining of whether at least one module has failed comprises determining whether the GPS module has failed based on a comparison between each of a longitudinal speed and a yaw angle of a driving model determined by the GPS module and a longitudinal speed and a yaw angle included in the driving information.
13. The control method of claim 9, wherein the reference value is determined based on variable values of the driving information corresponding to the driving model.
14. The control method of claim 9, wherein the determining of whether at least one module has failed comprises determining the driving information by comparing a first state variable determined based on at least one of a plurality of sensor modules and a second state variable determined based on a remaining one or more of the plurality of sensor modules.
15. The control method of claim 9, further comprising driving the vehicle excluding the driving model generated by the at least one module when determined that a failure has occurred in the at least one module.
