A METHOD AND A DEVICE FOR VERIFYING LIVENESS OF A FINGER
</title>

<abstract>
A method (700) for verifying liveness of a finger (102) of a user by capturing a first fingerprint sample (402) from the finger (102) placed on a display (104) by using a first sensor (106) placed under the display (104). The method (700) may comprise transmitting (702) light, by using a first light transmitting display area of the display (104), towards a first area of the finger (102), wherein the first light transmitting display area (108) is smaller than a first sensor area; capturing (704) reflected light from the finger (102) by the first sensor (104), wherein the reflected light (114) is transmitted through the display (104); and identifying (706) a first feature of the first fingerprint sample (402) by using the reflected light (114), wherein the first feature comprises scattered light from the finger (102), wherein the light transmitted from the display (104) comprises a first light component with a first wavelength from a first area of the display (104).

<claims>
1. A method (700) for verifying liveness of a finger (102) of a user by capturing a first fingerprint sample (402) from the finger (102) placed on a display (104) by using a first sensor (106) placed under the display (104), the method (700) comprising:
transmitting (702) light, by using a first light transmitting display area (108) of the display (104), towards a first area of the finger (102), wherein the first light transmitting display area (108) is smaller than a first sensor area;
capturing (704) reflected light from the finger (102) by the first sensor (104), wherein the reflected light (1 14) is transmitted through the display (104); and
identifying (706) a first feature of the first fingerprint sample (402) by using the reflected light (1 14), wherein the first feature comprises scattered light from the finger (102),
wherein the light transmitted from the display (104) comprises a first light component with a first wavelength from a first area of the display (104).
2. The method (700) according to claim 1 , further comprising capturing a second fingerprint sample (408) by:
transmitting light, by using a second light transmitting display area of the display (104), towards a second area of the finger (102);
capturing reflected light from the finger (102) by the first sensor (104), wherein the reflected light (1 14) is transmitted through the display (104); and
identifying a first feature of the second fingerprint sample (408) by using the reflected light,
wherein the light transmitted from the display (104) comprises a second light component with a second wavelength from a second area of the display (104).
3. The method (700) according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the first and/or second light transmitting display area is divided into subareas, wherein the light transmitted from the different subareas comprises different light component with different wavelengths.
4. The method (700) according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the step of transmitting light towards the first and/or second area of the finger (102) comprises: determining environmental data for the user by using at least one second sensor; and
adapting the light based on the environmental data.
5. The method (700) according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the step of identifying the first feature of the first and/or second fingerprint sample (402, 408) comprises generating a composite fingerprint sample by using the reflected light from the first and/or second light component.
6. The method (700) according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the step of identifying the first feature of the first and/or second fingerprint sample (402, 408) comprises generating the composite fingerprint sample by combining a plurality of generated fingerprint samples, wherein each generated fingerprint sample comprises different areas of the finger (102).
7. The method (700) according to any one of the preceding claims, further comprising identifying a second feature of the first and/or second fingerprint sample (402, 408) from the finger (102) by using the reflected light (1 14), wherein the second feature of the first and/or second fingerprint sample (402, 408) is based on a second feature area of the first and/or second fingerprint sample (402, 408), wherein the second feature area is a subset of a first feature area of the first and/or second fingerprint sample (402, 208) used for identifying the first feature of the first and/or second fingerprint sample (402, 408).
8. The method (700) according to any one of the preceding claims further comprising: extracting scattered light features from the first fingerprint sample (402);
retrieving a light scattering template;
comparing the scattered light features with the light scattering template, and if a match is found, generating a liveness acceptance signal, else
generating a liveness rejection signal.
9. The method (700) according to any one of the preceding claims further comprising: extracting fingerprint features from the second fingerprint sample (408);
retrieving a fingerprint template;
comparing the fingerprint features with the fingerprint template, and if a match is found, generating a fingerprint match acceptance signal, else generating a fingerprint match rejection signal.
10. A mobile device (202) configured to capture a fingerprint sample from a finger (102) of a user, the mobile device (202) comprising:
a display (104) configured to transmit light towards the finger (102); and a first sensor (106) placed under the display (104), wherein the first sensor (106) is configured to capture reflected light from the finger (102) according to the method according to claim 1 , wherein the reflected light is transmitted through the display (104).
1 1. The mobile device according to claim 10, further comprises at least one second sensor configured to determine environmental data for the user.
12. A system configured to verify liveness of a finger of a user, the system comprising: a mobile device (202) equipped with a display (104) and a first sensor (106), wherein the first sensor (106) is placed under the display (104), the mobile device (202) is configured to:
capture a first fingerprint sample (402) according to claim 1 ; send the first fingerprint sample to a server (204);
the server (204) comprising a control unit, a transceiver, and a memory, wherein the server (204) is configured to:
receive the first fingerprint sample (402);
receive a light scattering template;
execute an extraction function configured to extract scattered light features from the first fingerprint sample (402);
