<title>
Virtual computer system performance prediction device, performance prediction method, and program storage medium
</title>

<abstract>
To estimate the relation between virtual machine performance and scheduling parameters which are set in a scheduler which allocates CPU time to a virtual machine, provided is a performance prediction device, comprising a measuring unit and an estimation unit. The measuring unit sets the scheduling parameters to sample values, operates a virtual computer system, and measures CPU allocation delay time from when the virtual machine requests an allocation of the CPU to when the CPU is allocated to the virtual machine and turnaround time (TAT) of the virtual machine. Based on the results of the measurements, the estimation unit generates an estimation formula with the scheduling parameters and the CPU allocation delay time as explanatory variables and an estimated TAT as the response variable.
