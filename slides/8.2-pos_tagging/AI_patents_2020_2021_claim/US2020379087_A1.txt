METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR GENERATING RADAR REFLECTION POINTS
</title>

<abstract>
A method for generating radar reflection points comprising the steps of: providing a plurality of predefined radar reflection points of at least one first object detected by a radar and at least one first scenario description describing a first environment related to the detected first object; converting the predefined radar reflection points into at least one first power distribution pattern image related to a distribution of a power returning from the detected first object; training a model based on the first power distribution pattern image and the first scenario description; providing at least one second scenario description describing a second environment related to a second object; generating at least one second power distribution pattern image related to a distribution of a power returning from the second object based on the trained model and the second scenario description; and sampling the second power distribution pattern image.

<claims>
1. A method for generating radar reflection points, comprising the following steps: providing a plurality of predefined radar reflection points of at least one first object detected by a radar and at least one first scenario description describing a first environment related to the detected first object; converting the predefined radar reflection points into at least one first power distribution pattern image related to a distribution of a power returning from the detected first object; training a model based on the first power distribution pattern image and the first scenario description; providing at least one second scenario description describing a second environment related to a second object; generating at least one second power distribution pattern image related to a distribution of a power returning from the second object based on the trained model and the second scenario description; and sampling the second power distribution pattern image.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the step of converting the predefined radar reflection points into the at least one first power distribution pattern image includes: converting each of the predefined radar reflection points into a third power distribution pattern image related to a distribution of a power returning from an area around the each of the predefined radar reflection points; and merging the third power distribution pattern images to form the first power distribution pattern image.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein the step of converting each of the predefined radar reflection points into the third power distribution pattern image includes: implementing a sinc function using the each of the predefined radar reflection points as a variable of the sinc function in a longitudinal and/or lateral direction corresponding to a relative position between a radar and the first object.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein the first and second scenario description include spatial data related to the first and/or second object represented by a raster, and an object list with features of the first object and/or second object.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the first scenario description and the second scenario description are identical to one another.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein the step of training the model includes training a deep neural network.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein the step of generating the second power distribution pattern image is in addition based on a randomly generated noise value.
8. A system for generating radar reflection points, comprising: an image conversion preparation unit configured to provide a plurality of predefined radar reflection points of at least one first object detected by a radar and at least one first scenario description describing a first environment related to the detected first object; an image conversion unit configured to convert the predefined radar reflection points into at least one first power distribution pattern image related to a distribution of a power returning from the detected first object; a training unit configured to train a model based on the first power distribution pattern image and the first scenario description; a scenario description providing unit configured to provide at least one second scenario description describing a second environment related to a second object; an image generation unit configured to generate at least one second power distribution pattern image related to a distribution of a power returning from the second object based on the trained model and the second scenario description; and a sampling unit configured to sample the second power distribution pattern image.
9. A non-transitory machine-readable memory medium on which is stored a computer program for generating radar reflection points, the computer program, when executed by a computer, causing the computer to perform the following steps: providing a plurality of predefined radar reflection points of at least one first object detected by a radar and at least one first scenario description describing a first environment related to the detected first object; converting the predefined radar reflection points into at least one first power distribution pattern image related to a distribution of a power returning from the detected first object; training a model based on the first power distribution pattern image and the first scenario description; providing at least one second scenario description describing a second environment related to a second object; generating at least one second power distribution pattern image related to a distribution of a power returning from the second object based on the trained model and the second scenario description; and sampling the second power distribution pattern image.
