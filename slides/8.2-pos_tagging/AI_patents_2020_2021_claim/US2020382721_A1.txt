<title>
Unscanned Optical Inspection System using a micro camera array
</title>

<abstract>
An arrangement of one or more micro cameras are used in conjunction with computer controlled illumination to create a high-throughput microscope able to operate without the need of expensive scanning stages. A single unit contains a plurality of sensors, lenses tiled in such a way to cover a significant fraction of the desired field of view in a digital single acquisition. Mechanical stages and patterned illumination can then be used in conjunction with the system to enhanced the imaged depth of field, or create an acquisition stack to enhance the information acquired. Multiple units can be combined to obtain images of a single sample from different angles. The absence of mechanical stages makes the imaging system ideal for use in scenarios that require the sample to be in a climate and/or environmentally controlled chamber.

<claims>
1. A compact inspection system for inspecting items that is comprised of a fixed digital camera subsystem mounted in a frame with a location for holding an item to be inspected, which is combined with an image analysis subsystem to computationally post-process the image data acquired by the digital camera subsystem, where the digital camera subsystem consists of an array of multiple micro-cameras, where each micro-camera contains a digital image sensors and lens system that image a fraction of the item to be inspected at a resolution of 20 micrometers or smaller and the digital camera subsystem can detect optical radiation over a field-of-view of 100 mm or more in one diagonal in a single snapshot.
2. The system of claim 1, where the digital camera subsystem& contains mechanical actuators to change the angle, lateral position and axial position of one or more individual components within each micro-camera, including the sensors or the lens systems, over a distance much smaller than the entire digital camera subsystem field-of-view.
3. The system of claim 1, where each micro-camera within the digital camera subsystem contains one or more refocusing mechanisms, such that any one micro-camera may shift the plane of focus across which it collects image information from one image snapshot to the next, and such that the image information collected by any two micro-cameras can arise from different planes of focus.
4. The system of claim 1, where the location for holding an item contains actuators with limited travel compared to the entire field of view to be inspected.
5. The system in claim 1, where illumination may be an integrated part of the digital camera subsystem.
6. The system in claim 1, where illumination may be remote from the digital camera subsystem, distributed or complementary to integrated illumination in the digital camera subsystem.
7. The system in claim 4 or 5 where the illumination of the object may change between the image acquisition from each micro-camera within the digital camera subsystem.
8. The system in claim 1, where a material handling device is combined with the frame to provide automated transport of the item into and out of the camera subsystem's field-of-view (i.e., inspection zone).
9. The system in claim 1, where the image analysis subsystem consists of one or more computational processors to process the images from the multiple image sensors to create a single composite image, with a larger field-of-view than the field-of-view of any one of the micro-cameras within the camera subsystem, or to extract relevant features such as defects, or to detect a sample depth map, or to optimize the detected image information for a particular viewing purpose either by a human operator or another computer algorithm.
10. The system in claim 1, where the inspection system is located inside an environmentally controlled housing or inside an Equipment Front End Module "EFEM".
11. The system in claim 1, where the imaged sample is placed outside an environmentally controlled housing or outside an EFEM but positioned in such a way to inspects objects within these environmentally controlled housings through a transparent, or semi-transparent optical window.
12. The system in claim 1, where the individual image sensors in the digital cameras subsystem each have a lens system for focusing the image and the image for each sensor and lens device can be automatically focused on the item or remotely controlled to focus at an independently selected location on the item.
13. The system in claim 1, where the image sensors and lenses can be individually tilted or translated to optimize their viewing angle of the inspected item.
14. The system in claim 1, where multiple arrays of cameras are used in single system to acquire images of the sample from various angles.
15. The system in claim 1, where the system can be mounted on a simple low precision motion apparatus to move the digital camera subsystem to multiple viewing angles to capture images above and from the sides of the inspected item.
16. The system of claim 13, where the images are processed to provide a 3D view of the inspected item.
