<title>
Artificial intelligence and natural language processing based building and fire systems management system
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for detecting speech from occupants in a building management system is disclosed. Building management systems include fire alarm systems, building automation systems and security systems, in examples. Installed devices deployed within the building include audio transducers that detect speech from the occupants, and a management system panel processes the information from the installed devices and processes the detected speech from the occupants. In a fire alarm system, in one example, the fire alarm panel processes the detected speech from fire sensor devices and alarm notification devices as the installed devices. The fire alarm panel and/or its installed devices can identify commands from the detected speech for controlling and testing the fire alarm management system. In embodiments, Artificial Intelligence (AI) subsystems can be further added to the building management systems for control and information services.

<claims>
1. A building management system, comprising: installed devices deployed in a building that generate information, the installed devices including audio transducers for detecting speech from building occupants; and a management system panel that processes the information from the installed devices and processes the detected speech from the occupants; wherein the installed devices report back the generated information via a wired network interface and report back the detected speech via a wireless network interface.
2. A building management system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the installed devices include fire sensor devices, including smoke detection systems, manual alarm signaling devices and alarm notification devices, and the management system panel is a fire alarm panel.
3. A building management system as claimed in claim 2, wherein the generated information includes the detection of smoke, heat, and/or flames.
4. A building management system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the installed devices include motion sensor devices, surveillance camera devices, and/or door controller devices, and the management system panel is a security panel.
5. A building management system as claimed in claim 4, wherein the generated information includes detected motion and detected surveillance images.
6. A building management system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the installed devices include thermostats, lighting systems, and power control units, and the management system panel is a building automation control panel.
7. A building management system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the management system utilizes artificial Intelligence and machine learning to process information received from the installed devices to adapt to changing situations and learn as the building use changes.
8. A building management system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the management system panel comprises an audio system including a speech recognition subsystem and a voice recognition subsystem.
9. A building management system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the management system panel analyzes the detected speech from the installed devices and maintains presence information indicating rooms of the building containing occupants.
10. A building management system as claimed in claim 9, wherein the management system panel analyzes the detected speech from the installed devices and maintains counts of occupants in the rooms of the building.
11. A building management system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the management system panel generates building alarms in response to the detected speech.
12. A building management system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the management system panel analyzes the detected speech for commands from a technician concerning a test of the building management system.
13. A building management system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the management system panel analyzes the detected speech and performs voice recognition against a list of known speakers to identify the speaker.
14. A method of operation of a building management system, the method comprising: generating information at installed devices for the building management system; detecting speech of building occupants at the installed devices via audio transducers; processing the information from the installed devices at a management system panel of the building management system; processing the detected speech from the occupants at the management system panel; and the installed devices reporting back the generated information to the building management panel via a wired network interface and reporting back the detected speech via a wireless network.
15. A method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the installed devices include fire sensor devices and alarm notification devices, and the management system panel is a fire alarm panel.
16. A method as claimed in claim 15, wherein the generated information includes the detection of smoke, heat, and/or flames.
17. A method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the installed devices include motion sensor devices, surveillance camera devices, and/or door controller devices, and the management system panel is a security panel.
18. A method as claimed in claim 17, wherein the generated information includes detected motion and detected surveillance images.
19. A method as claimed in claim 16, further comprising the building management system panel communicates detected speech to a remote connected services server.
20. A method as claimed in claim 14, further comprising the management system panel analyzing the detected speech from the installed devices and maintaining presence information indicating rooms of the building containing occupants.
21. A method as claimed in claim 14, further comprising the management system panel analyzing the detected speech from the installed devices and maintaining counts of occupants in the rooms of the building.
22. A method as claimed in claim 14, further comprising the management system panel generating building alarms in response to the detected speech.
23. A method as claimed in claim 14, further comprising the management system panel analyzing the detected speech for commands from a technician concerning a test of the building management system.
24. A method as claimed in claim 14, further comprising the management system panel analyzing the detected speech and performing voice recognition against a list of known speakers to identify the speaker.
25. A building automation system, comprising: installed devices deployed in a building that generate information, the installed devices including audio transducers for detecting speech from building occupants; and a management system panel that processes the information from the installed devices and processes the detected speech from the occupants; wherein the management system applies artificial intelligence and machine learning to information received from the installed devices to adapt to changing situations and learn as the building use changes.
