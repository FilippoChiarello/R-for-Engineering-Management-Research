<title>
Database platform for realtime updating of user data from third party sources
</title>

<abstract>
A data processing system communicates with a secure third-party database to obtain information about a user that is usable to determine one or more items associated with the user. The system then coordinates gathering and identification of additional data relevant to the user from other third-party data sources, to potentially update the user's information stored with the secure third-party database. The updated information may then be accessed at the secure third-party database to determine items associated with the user, which may include additional items in view of the additional data.
