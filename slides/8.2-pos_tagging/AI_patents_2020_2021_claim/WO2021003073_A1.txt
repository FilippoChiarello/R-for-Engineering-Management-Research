PREBIOTIC AND PROBIOTIC COOKIE PREPARATION
</title>

<abstract>
A cookie that provides a prebiotic effect and/or a probiotic effect to a consumer is described. The cookie fails to contain refined sugars, synthetic vitamins, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), artificial sweeteners, and artificial preservatives. The cookie comprises at least two baked food compositions formed into a biscuit. Each of the at least two baked food compositions contains a polyphenol, a resistant starch, and a prebiotic soluble fiber. A crème filing is sandwiched between the at least two baked food compositions. The crème filing comprises a resistant starch, a nut butter, a vegetable fat, and spores of a probiotic bacterium. Consumption of the cookie increases Lactobacillus bulgaricus and butyrate in the consumer.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A cookie for improving gut health, the cookie comprising:
a baked food composition containing a polyphenol, a resistant starch, and a prebiotic soluble fiber.
2. The cookie of claim 1, wherein the cookie fails to contain refined sugars, synthetic vitamins, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), artificial sweeteners, and artificial preservatives.
3. The cookie of claim 1, wherein the baked food composition is a biscuit.
4. The cookie of claim 3, further comprising:
a creme filling sandwiched between two of the biscuits, wherein the creme filing fails to contain refined sugars, synthetic vitamins, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), artificial sweeteners, and artificial preservatives.
5. The cookie of claim 4, wherein the creme filling comprises:
a resistant starch, a nut butter, a vegetable fat, and spores of a probiotic bacterium.
6. The cookie of claim 5, wherein the spores of the probiotic bacterium comprise spores of
Bacillus coagulans.
7. The cookie of claim 1, wherein the prebiotic soluble fiber is present in a range of approximately 15% to approximately 25% (w/w) of the baked food composition, and wherein the polyphenol is present in a range of approximately 0.1% to approximately 5% (w/w) of the baked food composition.
8. The cookie of claim 1, wherein the resistant starch is present in a range of approximately 15% to approximately 25% (w/w) of the cookie. 9. The cookie of claim 1, wherein the prebiotic soluble fiber is lupin flour.
10. The cookie of claim 1, wherein the resistant starch is selected from the group consisting of: a resistant dextrin and tigemut flour. 11. The cookie of claim 1, wherein the polyphenol comprises a kiwi fruit powder.
12. The cookie of claim 1, wherein the baked food composition fails to contain refined sugars, synthetic vitamins, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), artificial sweeteners, and artificial preservatives.
13. The cookie of claim 1, wherein consumption of the cookie provides a prebiotic effect and/or a probiotic effect to a consumer.
14. The cookie of claim 1, wherein consumption of the cookie increases Lactobacillus bulgaricus and butyrate in a consumer.
15. A method for making a cookie that provides a prebiotic effect and/or a probiotic effect to a consumer, the method comprising:
blending dry ingredients comprising a polyphenol, a resistant starch and a prebiotic soluble fiber with vegetable fat;
mixing in water until glomeration and formation of a dough; and
baking the dough to produce a baked food composition.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the prebiotic soluble fiber is lupin flour, wherein the resistant starch is selected from the group consisting of: a resistant dextrin and tigemut flour, and wherein the polyphenol comprises a kiwi fruit powder. 17. The method of claim 15, wherein the baked food composition is a biscuit, and wherein the method of claim 15 further comprises sandwiching a creme filling between two of the biscuits to produce a cookie.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the creme filling is produced by:
mixing vegetable fats to form a first mixture;
mixing nut butter with a resistant starch to form a second mixture; and blending the first and second mixtures with a natural flavor and probiotic spores until glomeration of the creme filling, wherein the probiotic spores comprise spores of Bacillus coagulans. 19. A cookie that provides a prebiotic effect and/or a probiotic effect to a consumer, the cookie comprising:
at least two baked food compositions, each of the at least two baked food compositions containing a polyphenol comprising a kiwi fruit powder, a resistant starch selected from the group consisting of: a resistant dextrin and tigernut flour, and a prebiotic soluble fiber is lupin flour; and
a creme filing sandwiched between the at least two baked food compositions, the creme filing comprising a resistant starch, a nut butter, a vegetable fat, and spores of a probiotic bacterium, wherein the spores of the probiotic bacterium comprise spores of Bacillus coagulans, and wherein the cookie fails to contain refined sugars, synthetic vitamins, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), artificial sweeteners, and artificial preservatives.
20. The cookie of claim 19, wherein consumption of the cookie increases Lactobacillus bulgaricus and butyrate in the consumer.
