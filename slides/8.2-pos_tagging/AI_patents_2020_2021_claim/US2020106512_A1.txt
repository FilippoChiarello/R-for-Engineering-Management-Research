<title>
FACILITATION OF BEAM MANAGEMENT FOR 5G OR OTHER NEXT GENERATION NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
A test transmission can be used to train and/or select a signal. For example, a cellular network can configure a receiver with a recommended receiver signal sweeping pattern for mobile devices. A transmitter device can duplicate a data packet transmission and send it to a receiver device to ensure that the receiver can receive the duplicated packets from different signals. Consequently, the duplicated data packet can be indicated in the associated control channel so that the receiver is aware that the data packet is a duplicated transmission, and based on this info and configuration data, the receiver can select a more favorable signal.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: receiving, by a wireless network device comprising a processor, configuration data representative of a configuration for reception of patterns of signals; based on the configuration data, receiving, by the wireless network device from a signal transmission device, a duplicate data packet associated with a data packet to be sent to a mobile device; and in response to the receiving the duplicate data packet, selecting, by the wireless network device, a beam to be used based on the configuration data.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the duplicate data packet is duplicative of the data packet to be sent to the mobile device.
3. The method of claim 2, further comprising: receiving, by the wireless network device, an indication of a number of times the duplicate data packet is to be received.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: in response to receiving the signals, determining, by the wireless network device, a signal priority associated with a signal of the signals.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising: in response to the determining the signal priority, utilizing, by the wireless network device, the signal for a remainder of a communication session.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: in response to receiving the signals, comparing, by the wireless network device, a first signal of the signals to a second signal of the signals.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the comparing comprises comparing a first reference signal received power of the first signal to a second reference signal received power of the second signal, resulting in comparison data.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising: based on the comparison data, selecting, by the wireless network device, the first signal to be used for a communication session.
9. A system, comprising: a processor; and a memory that stores executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: receiving configuration data representative of a configuration for reception of patterns of signals; based on the configuration data, receiving from a signal transmission device, a duplicate data packet associated with a data packet to be sent to a mobile device; and in response to the receiving the duplicate data packet, selecting a signal to be used based on the configuration data.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the operations further comprise: in response to the receiving the duplicated data packet, assigning a priority value to the signal.
11. The system of claim 9, wherein the signal is a first signal, and wherein the selecting the signal is based on a comparison between a first quality of the first signal and a second quality of a second signal.
12. The system of claim 9, wherein the signal is a first signal, and wherein the selecting the signal is based on a comparison between a first power of the first signal and a second power of a second signal.
13. The system of claim 10, wherein the operations further comprise: in response to the selecting the signal, utilizing the signal to decode communication data.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the operations further comprise: in response to the utilizing the signal to decode the communication data, sending acknowledgment data, representative of an acknowledgment associated with the communication data, to the signal transmission device.
15. A machine-readable storage medium, comprising executable instructions that, when executed by a processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: receiving configuration data associated with signal patterns of signals to be received by a reception device of a wireless network; in response to the receiving the configuration data, receiving a first data packet, wherein the first data packet is a duplicate data packet of a second data packet; and in response to the receiving the first data packet, and based on the receiving the configuration data, determining a signal, of the signals, to be used to receive a third data packet.
16. The machine-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the first data packet is received from a transmission device.
17. The machine-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the third data packet is received from a vehicle.
18. The machine-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the operations further comprise: facilitating transmitting, from a transmission device, the second packet data to a mobile device.
19. The machine-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the determining the signal is performed in response to a threshold value associated with a priority of the signal being determined to have been satisfied.
20. The machine-readable storage medium of claim 15, wherein the signal is a first signal, and wherein the determining the signal comprises comparing the first signal to a second signal of the signals.
