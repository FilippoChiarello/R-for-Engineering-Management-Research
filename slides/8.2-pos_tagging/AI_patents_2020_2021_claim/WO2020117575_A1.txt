AUTOMATED REAL-TIME HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE CONTENT REVIEW SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, systems and computer program products are described herein that enable the identification and correction of incorrect and/or inconsistent tones in the bright regions in an HDR image. A bright region is identified in an image. The bright region is classified into an assigned classification. A luminance value of the bright region is determined and compared to a predefined luminance values corresponding to the classification. The luminance value of the bright region is adjusted to match the predefined luminance values where there is a mismatch. Bright regions including mismatched or incorrect luminance values may be rendered on display to include a visual indicator that such regions include mismatched luminance values.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising:
identifying in an image a bright region that is a portion of the image;
classifying the identified bright region into an assigned classification of a set of predetermined classifications;
determining a luminance value of the identified bright region;
comparing the determined luminance value to a predefined luminance value corresponding to the assigned classification;
adjusting a luminance value of the identified bright region to an adjusted luminance value based on said comparing; and
rendering the image with the identified bright region having the adjusted luminance value.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein said comparing comprises:
determining the determined luminance value is incorrect based on a difference from the predefined luminance value; and
wherein said adjusting further comprises:
rendering a visual indicator on the image in a location corresponding to the identified bright region; and
receiving a manually corrected luminance value for the identified bright region as the adjusted luminance value.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein said adjusting comprises:
automatically determining the adjusted luminance value for the identified bright region.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein said adjusting comprises:
adjusting a luminance value of the identified bright region to an adjusted luminance value that is a same luminance value for a second bright region in the image having the assigned classification.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein said rendering comprises:
applying a linear scale to the adjusted luminance value to account for a visual effect in the displayed image to generate a scaled and adjusted luminance value; and rendering the displayed image with the identified bright region having the scaled and adjusted luminance value.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein said identifying comprises:
providing the displayed image to a machine learning model to identify a location and a size of the bright region, the machine learning model trained to identify bright regions.
7. The method of claim 6, where said classifying comprises:
classifying the identified bright region by the machine learning model.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
logging information of the identified bright region or which an adjusted luminance value is determined.
9. A system, comprising:
one or more processor circuits;
one or more memory devices connected to the one or more processor circuits, the one or more memory devices storing computer program logic for execution by the one or more processor circuits, the computer program logic comprising:
an image classifier configured to:
identify in a displayed image a bright region that is a portion of the displayed image, and
classify the identified bright region into an assigned classification of a set of predetermined classifications;
a luminance analyzer configured to determine a luminance value of the identified bright region, and determine a comparison between the determined luminance value and a predefined luminance value corresponding to the assigned classification;
an image Tenderer configured to render the image with the identified bright region having the adjusted luminance value; and
a luminance adjuster configured to adjust a luminance value of the identified bright region to an adjusted luminance value based on said comparison, the image Tenderer further configured to render the displayed image with the identified bright region having the adjusted luminance value.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein determining a comparison comprises:
determining the determined luminance value is incorrect based on a difference from the predefined luminance value; and
wherein the luminance adjuster is configured to adjust a luminance value of the identified bright region by receiving a manually corrected luminance value for the identified bright region as the adjusted luminance value.
11. The system of claim 9, wherein the luminance adjuster is configured to
automatically determine the adjusted luminance value for the identified bright region.
12. The system of claim 9, wherein said identifying comprises:
providing the displayed image to a machine learning model to identify a location and a size of the bright region, the machine learning model trained to identify bright regions.
13. The system of claim 12, where said classifying comprises:
classifying the identified bright region by the machine learning model.
14. The system of claim 9, further comprising:
a logger configured to log information of the identified bright region and information of at least one other bright region in the image for which an adjusted luminance value is determined.
15. A computer-readable memory device having computer program logic recorded thereon, comprising:
computer program logic for enabling a processor to perform any of the steps of claims 1-8.
