SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ESTIMATING EMBRYO VIABILITY
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method, including the steps of: receiving video data of a human embryo, the video data representing a sequence of images of the human embryo in chronological order; applying at least one three-dimensional (3D) artificial neural network (ANN) to the video data to determine a viability score for the human embryo, wherein the viability score represents a likelihood that the human embryo will result in a viable embryo or a viable fetus; and outputting the viability score.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method, including the steps of: receiving video data of a human embryo, the video data representing a sequence of images of the human embryo in chronological order; applying at least one three-dimensional (3D) artificial neural network (ANN) to the video data to determine a viability score for the human embryo, wherein the viability score represents a likelihood that the human embryo will result in a viable embryo or a viable fetus; and outputting the viability score.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the 3D artificial neural network includes a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN).
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the viability score represents a probability that transferring the human embryo will result in a viable fetus.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the viability score represents a probability that transferring the human embryo will result in any one or more of the following: a viable fetal heart detected within a predetermined period of time after embryo transfer; a biochemical pregnancy detected based on a urine test or a blood test; a viable gestational sac or a viable yolk sac detected on ultrasound at a predetermined time after embryo transfer; and a live birth at the end of pregnancy;
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the 3D ANN is trained by using: video data representing a plurality of sequences of images of a plurality of human embryos; and pregnancy outcome data that indicates whether each of the plurality of human embryos has resulted in a viable embryo or a viable fetus.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the training of the 3D ANN is performed without manual selection or extraction of features, or human annotation of key development events.
7. The method of claim 2, wherein the 3D CNN includes a plurality of convolution layers each using a 3D convolution kernel, and a plurality of pooling layers each using a 3D pooling kernel.
8. The method of claim 1, further including one or more of: standardising the received video data so that all videos span a predetermined time period; cropping the video data to retain predetermined areas of the data; adjusting contrast of the images in the video data; and resizing the images in the video data to a predetermined image size.
9. The method of claim 1, further including: processing the video data by adding a visual overlay to at least some images of the video data, the visual overlay indicative of contributions of respective portions of the images to the viability score; and outputting the images with the visual overlays.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the visual overlay is a heat map.
11. The method of claim 9, wherein the visual overlay is generated by: determining changes of the viability score output caused by occluding portions of the images or sequence of images in the video data.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein occluding portions of the images in the video data includes applying a three-dimensional occlusion window to the video data.
13. The method of claim 1, further including: determining a ranking of a plurality of human embryos based on their viability scores.
14. The method of claim 13, further including: selecting, based on the ranking, one of the plurality of human embryos for a single embryo transfer or the order in which multiple embryos should be transferred.
15. A system, including at least one processor configured to: receive video data of a human embryo, the video data including a sequence of images of the human embryo in chronological order; apply at least one three-dimensional (3D) artificial neural network to the video data to determine a viability score for the human embryo, wherein the viability score represents a likelihood that the human embryo will result in a viable embryo or a viable fetus; and output the viability score.
16. 16.-28. (canceled)
29. The system of claim 15, wherein the system includes: an image sensor for capturing video data of the human embryo; wherein the processor is configured to receive the captured video data from the image sensor.
30. The system of claim 15, wherein the system includes a time-lapse incubator.
31. A method including: generating a viability score for a human embryo by probabilistically classifying data representing a video of the human embryo with an artificial neural network (ANN); or training an artificial neural network (ANN) to probabilistically classify data representing a video of a human embryo to generate a viability score for the human embryo.
32. The method of claim 31, wherein the viability score represents a likelihood that the human embryo will result in a viable embryo or a viable foetus.
33. The method of claim 31, wherein the video is of the human embryo in an incubator optionally for a preselected period of time; and/or wherein the video includes a series of images optionally including time-lapse images.
34. The method of claim 31, wherein the ANN is a three-dimensional (3D) ANN, and/or a convolutional neural network (CNN).
35. The method of claim 31, wherein the ANN is trained using: data representing a plurality of videos of human embryos; and data representing whether the human embryos have resulted in respective viable embryos or viable fetuses.
36. A system, including at least one processor configured to: generate a viability score for a human embryo by probabilistically classifying data representing a video of the human embryo with an artificial neural network (ANN); or train an artificial neural network (ANN) to probabilistically classify data representing a video of a human embryo to generate a viability score for the human embryo.
