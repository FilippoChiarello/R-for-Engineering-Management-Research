<title>
SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR UTILIZING AUGMENTED REALITY IN SURGERY
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure involves object recognition as a method of registration, using a stereoscopic camera on Augmented Reality (AR) glasses or an endoscope as the image capture technology. Exemplary objects include surgical tools, anatomical components or features, such as bone or cartilage, etc. By detecting just a portion of the object in the image data of the surgical scene, the present disclosure may register and track a portion of the patient's anatomy, such as the pelvis, the knee, etc. The present disclosure also optionally displays information on the AR glasses themselves, such as the entire pelvis, the femur, the tibia, etc. The present disclosure may include combinations of the foregoing features, and may eliminate the need for electromagnetic, inertial, or infrared stereoscopic tracking as the tracking technology.

<claims>
1. A system comprising:
a registration and tracking device (1806, 4408, or 4500), the registration and tracking device including:
at least three legs or a surface (4420) arranged for docking the registration and tracking device to a portion (1804) of a patient's anatomy in a predetermined and fixed location;
a three-dimensional (3D) shape (2108) having a surface; and one or more markings on the surface of the 3D shape; a computer-based surgical planning system (1700) configured to:
present a two-dimensional (2D) or a three-dimensional (3D) model (1804) of the portion of the patient's anatomy;
determine a location for a 3D model of the registration and tracking device (1806) as docked to the 2D or 3D model of the portion of the patient's anatomy;
establish a coordinate system for the registration and tracking device; determine a location of one or more surgical tools (1902) relative to the coordinate system for the registration and tracking device;
determine a location of at least one implant relative to the coordinate system for the registration and tracking device;
generate one or more files from which a plurality of virtual images and/or holograms may be produced of combinations of two or more of:
the 2D or 3D model of the portion of the patient's anatomy;
the registration and tracking device;
the one or more surgical tools; and
the at least one implant; and
an augmented reality (AR) head-mounted device (HMD) (200), the AR HMD including:
at least one sensor (226, 228, or 230) configured to detect the one or more markings on the surface of the 3D shape of the registration and tracking device; one or more projectors (208) configured to present the plurality of virtual images and/or holograms; and
a navigation system (1600) that tracks the registration and tracking device and anchors the plurality of virtual images and/or holograms in a space based on the coordinate system for the registration and tracking device. 2. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more markings is one or more Quick Response (QR) codes (2112) or a checkerboard pattern. 3. The system of claims 1 or 2, wherein the computer-based surgical planning system is further configured to:
determine a location of the one or more surgical tools relative to a coordinate system for the 2D or 3D model of the portion of the patient's anatomy; and
generate one or more transformation matrices between the coordinate system for the 2D or 3D model of the portion of the patient's anatomy and the coordinate system for the registration and tracking device, and wherein the AR HMD utilizes the one or more transformation matrices to present the plurality of virtual images and/or holograms in the space. 4. The system of any of the preceding claims, wherein the computer-based surgical planning system is further configured to determine a sequence of presentation for the plurality of virtual images and/or holograms and the AR HMD presents the plurality of virtual images and/or holograms in the sequence of presentation. 5. The system of any of the preceding claims, wherein the AR HMD presents the plurality of virtual images and/or holograms of the one or more surgical tools and of the at least one implant in the location for the one or more surgical tools and in the location for the at least one implant. 6. The system of any of the preceding claims, wherein the registration and tracking device and/or the 3D shape is reusable. 7. A computer-implemented method comprising the following steps:
presenting a two-dimensional (2D) or a three-dimensional (3D) model (1804) of a portion of a patient's anatomy; determining a location of a registration and tracking device (1806) as docked to the 2D or 3D model of the portion of the patient's anatomy;
establishing a coordinate system for the 3D model of the registration and tracking device;
determining locations of one or more surgical tools and at least one implant relative to a coordinate system for the 2D or 3D model of the portion of the patient's anatomy;
generating files (1716) for presenting virtual images and/or holograms of the one or more surgical tools and the at least one implant at the determined locations relative to the coordinate system for the 2D or 3D model of the portion of the patient's anatomy;
generating a transformation matrix between the coordinate system for the 2D or 3D model of the portion of the patient' s anatomy and the coordinate system for the registration and tracking device; and
exporting the virtual images and/or holograms to an augmented reality (AR) headmounted device (HMD). 8. A computer-readable medium comprising instructions which, when executed by a computer, cause the computer to carry out the steps of the method of claim 7. 9. A data processing system comprising a processor adapted to perform the method of claim 7. 10. A computer-implemented method comprising the following steps:
recognizing a registration and tracking device in space;
receiving files (1716) for presenting virtual images and/or holograms of one or more surgical tools and at least one implant at determined locations relative to a coordinate system established for the registration and tracking device;
receiving a transformation matrix determining the orientation and positions of the virtual images and/or holograms relative to the coordinate system established for the registration and tracking device; and
utilizing the transformation matrix to present the virtual images and/or holograms anchored in a space at the determined locations. 11. The computer-implemented method of claim 10, wherein recognizing the registration and tracking device includes recognizing a hub (2102) of the registration and tracking device, the hub having a predetermined shape. 12. The computer-implemented method of claim 10 or 11, wherein recognizing the registration and tracking device further includes recognizing one or more codes at surfaces of a three-dimensional (3D) shape at the registration and tracking device. 13. A computer-readable medium comprising instructions which, when executed by a computer, in particular by an augmented reality device, cause the computer to carry out the steps of the method of any one of claims 10-12. 14. A data processing system, in particular an augmented reality device, comprising a processor adapted to perform the method of any one of claims 10 -12. 15. A registration and tracking device (1806, 2100), comprising:
