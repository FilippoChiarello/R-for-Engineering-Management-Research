USE OF GENE EXPRESSION DATA AND GENE SIGNALING NETWORKS ALONG WITH GENE EDITING TO DETERMINE WHICH VARIANTS HARM GENE FUNCTION
</title>

<abstract>
Provided are methods of determining the pathogenicity of a genetic variant, the method comprising: selecting a gene of interest; identifying a network of genes or gene variants that are up-regulated, down-regulated, or co-expressed with the gene of interest, and/or that interact directly or indirectly with the gene of interest; and determining the pathogenicity of the gene of interest based on the presence, absence, and/or expression levels of the network of genes. Also provided are methods of constructing a pathogenicity classifier for a genetic variant, the method comprising training a pathogenicity classifier.

<claims>
1. A method of determining the pathogenicity of a genetic variant, the method comprising: receiving, by a processing device, a first training dataset that includes expression data for a gene of interest and one or more other genes that are up-regulated, down-regulated, or co-expressed with the gene of interest, and/or that interact directly or indirectly with the gene of interest or genes that the gene of interest interacts directly or indirectly with;
receiving a second dataset that includes phenotypic and/or genotypic data associated with the presence, absence, and/or expression levels of the gene of interest and/or the other genes;
training a model on the first and second training datasets to identify a network of genes associated with phenotypic outcomes; and
scoring the pathogenicity of the gene of interest based on the network of genes associated with phenotypic outcomes.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising receiving a list of genes from a third dataset that includes data associated with known gene-gene, gene-protein and / or protein - protein interaction networks for the gene of interest and/or the other genes, and
training the model using the first, second, and third datasets to identify the network of genes associated with phenotypic outcomes.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the second dataset comprises phenotypic data associated with benign other genes and pathogenic other genes.
4. The method of any one of claims 1-3, wherein the training comprises one or both of (i) normalizing and standardizing expression levels of the gene of interest and/or the other genes, and (ii) resampling data in the training samples
5. The method of any one of claims 1-4, wherein one or more of SVM, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, naive bayes, and adaboost are used to identify the network of genes or gene variants associated with the phenotypic outcomes.
6. The method of any one of claims 1-5, wherein the first dataset and/or the second dataset each independently comprises data from a plurality of datasets.
7. The method of any one of claims 1-6, wherein the first and/or second training datasets independently include data from one or more tissues selected from brain, heart, lung, kidney, liver, muscle, bone, stomach, intestines, esophagus, and skin tissue; and/or one or more of a biological fluids selected from urine, blood, plasma, serum, saliva, semen, sputum, cerebral spinal fluid, mucus, sweat, vitreous liquid, and milk, and wherein a test set may include different sets of tissues and/or biological fluids from the tissues and/or biological fluids used for training.
8. The method of any one of claims 1-7, wherein the gene of interest is associated with an autosomal dominant condition; or
wherein the gene of interest is associated with an autosomal recessive condition; or wherein the gene of interest is associated with a risk for a non-Mendelian condition.
9. The method of any one of claims 1-8, wherein the first dataset is comprised of mRNA and/or protein expression data associated with the gene of interest and/or the other genes or gene variants.
10. The method of any one of claims 1-9, wherein the gene of interest is a genetic variant of interest.
11. A method of constructing a pathogenicity classifier for a genetic variant, the method comprising training a pathogenicity classifier on a processing device, wherein the method comprises using as input:
(i) a first training dataset that includes expression data for a gene of interest and one or more other genes that are up-regulated, down-regulated, or co-expressed with the gene of interest, and/or that interact directly or indirectly with the gene of interest or with genes that the gene of interest directly or indirectly interacts with; and
(ii) a second training dataset that includes phenotypic and/or genotypic data associated with the presence, absence, and/or expression levels of the other genes; and
wherein the method comprises identifying a network of genes that are up-regulated, downregulated, or co-expressed with the gene of interest, and/or that interact directly or indirectly with the gene of interest or with genes that the gene of interest directly or indirectly interacts with.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising using as input a third training sample from a third dataset that includes data associated with known gene-gene or gene-protein interactions for the gene of interest and/or the other genes.
13. A method of determining the pathogenicity of a genetic variant, the method comprising: performing genotyping, and establishing that there is a variant of unknown significance; measuring expression levels in one or more samples from one or more subjects with the variant, and applying the trained model of any one of claims 1-10; and
determining the pathogenicity of the gene of interest based on the presence, absence, and/or expression levels of the network of genes.
14. The method of claim 13, where the genotyping comprises performing whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing or target panel sequencing.
15. The method of claim 13 or 14, wherein measuring expression levels comprises obtaining mRNA and/or protein expression data associated with the gene of interest and/or the other genes.
16. The method of any one of claims 13-15, wherein the first dataset comprises data from a genetic screen that comprises (i) perturbing the DNA of one or more cells and inserting a variant of known significance (benign or pathogenic), and (ii) validating that that the genetic variant of known significance is classifying correctly using measured expression levels.
17. The method of any one of claims 13-16, wherein the second dataset comprises data from a genetic screen that comprises (i) perturbing the DNA of one or more cells, and (ii) determining the phenotype associated with the one or more perturbed cells.
18. The method of claim 16 or 17, wherein the perturbing is conducted with CRISPR.
19. The method of claim 16 or 17 wherein the measured expression levels comprise levels of mRNA of a network of genes identified in the classification model.
20. The method of any of the preceding claims, further comprising:
identifying a genetic variant in a sample taken from a subject;
