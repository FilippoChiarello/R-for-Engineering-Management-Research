DIAGNOSTIC APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
A diagnostic apparatus for analysing a sample to diagnose disease, the apparatus comprising: a separating element for separating gas derived from the sample into component parts; a sensor arrangement coupled to the separating element such that a component part of the gas is directed towards the sensor arrangement, the sensor arrangement being configured to detect compounds which may be indicative of disease; and a processing element coupled to an output of the sensor arrangement, the processing element being configured to process a signal output by the sensor arrangement to provide a diagnosis.

<claims>
1. A method of diagnosing disease by analysing a gas obtained from a faeces or urine sample, the method comprising the steps of: altering the pH of the faeces or urine sample; heating, using a sample heater, the pH adjusted faeces or urine sample to release gases from the sample; separating a gas evolved from the sample into component parts; directing a component part of the gas towards a sensor arrangement, the sensor arrangement being configured to detect a compound which may be indicative of disease, the sensor comprising: a metal oxide element comprising a mixture of zinc oxide and tin oxide; and a sensor heater configured to heat the metal oxide element; wherein the sensor is configured to apply a voltage to the metal oxide element to produce current flow in the metal oxide element; maintaining, using the sensor heater, a temperature of the metal oxide element during sensing at between 425° C. and 500° C.; and processing a signal indicative of the current flow by the sensor arrangement to produce an indication capable of providing a diagnosis.
2. A method according to claim 1 wherein the step of separating the gas comprises passing the gas through a separating element comprising a multi-capillary column.
3. A method according to claim 1 wherein the step of separating the gas comprises passing the gas through a separating element comprising a single-capillary column or a plurality of single-capillary columns.
4. A method according to claim 1 wherein the sensor arrangement comprises two or more sensors arranged in a serial configuration.
5. A method according to claim 1 wherein the sensor arrangement comprises two or more sensors arranged in a parallel configuration.
6. A method according to claim 1 wherein the sensor arrangement is configured to detect one or more volatile compounds present in the gas.
7. A method according to claim 1 wherein the sensor arrangement is configured to detect one or more volatile organic compounds present in the gas.
8. A method according to claim 6 wherein the sensor arrangement is configured to generate a signal indicative of the elution time of a volatile compound in the sample.
9. A method according to claim 8 wherein the step of processing the signal output by the sensor arrangement comprises comparing the signal generated by the sensor arrangement to a known profile from one or more previously-diagnosed samples.
10. A method according to claim 1 wherein the step of processing the signal output by the sensor arrangement comprises processing the signal using an artificial neural network to provide the diagnosis.
