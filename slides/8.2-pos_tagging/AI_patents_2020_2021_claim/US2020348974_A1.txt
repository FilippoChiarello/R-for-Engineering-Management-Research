DETERMINING A LOAD BALANCING MECHANISM FOR SHARED RESOURCES IN A STORAGE SYSTEM USING A MACHINE LEARNING MODULE
</title>

<abstract>
A plurality of interfaces that share a plurality of resources in a storage controller are maintained. In response to an occurrence of a predetermined number of operations associated with an interface of the plurality of interfaces, an input is provided on a plurality of attributes of the storage controller to a machine learning module. In response to receiving the input, the machine learning module generates an output value corresponding to a number of resources of the plurality of resources to allocate to the interface in the storage controller.
