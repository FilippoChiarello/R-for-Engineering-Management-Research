SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR CONSTRUCTING A HIGH-DEFINITION MAP BASED ON LANDMARKS
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the disclosure provide systems and methods for updating an HD map. The system may include a communication interface configured to receive sensor data acquired of a target region by at least one sensor equipped on a vehicle as the vehicle travels along a trajectory via a network. The system may further include a storage configured to store the HD map. The system may also include at least one processor. The at least one processor may be configured to identify a plurality of data frames associated with a landmark, each data frame corresponding to one of a plurality of local HD map on the trajectory. The at least one processor may be further configured to jointly optimize pose information of the plurality of local HD maps and pose information of the landmark. The at least one processor may be further configured to construct the HD map based on the based on the pose information of the plurality of local HD maps.
