METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SIDELINK COMMUNICATION IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to sidelink communication in wireless communications. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a method performed by a first wireless device in a wireless communication system comprises: performing a direct communication with a second wireless device via a communication link based on a context stored in the first wireless device; detecting a failure of the communication link upon which a timer starts, wherein the context remains stored in the first wireless device while the timer is running; and upon detecting a good quality of the communication link while the timer is running, transmitting information indicating a recovery of the communication link based on the context to the second wireless device.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method performed by a first wireless device in a wireless communication system, the method comprising: performing a direct communication with a second wireless device via a communication link based on a context stored in the first wireless device; detecting a failure of the communication link upon which a timer starts, wherein the context remains stored in the first wireless device while the timer is running; and upon detecting a good quality of the communication link while the timer is running, transmitting information indicating a recovery of the communication link based on the context to the second wireless device.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the detecting of the failure of the communication link comprises detecting that a quality of the communication link becomes lower than a first threshold, and wherein the detecting of the good quality of the communication link comprises detecting that a quality of the communication link becomes higher than a second threshold while the timer is running.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein at least one of the first threshold or the second threshold is configured or signalled by a network to the wireless device via at least one of downlink control information (DCI), a media access control (MAC) control element (MAC CE), or a radio resource control (RRC) signalling.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving configuration information for a setup of the communication link; and setting the context storing the configuration information.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the configuration information comprises at least one of an identity (ID) related to the second wireless device, an ID of a service related to the direct communication, a capability of the second wireless device, a quality of service (QoS) information of the service, assistance information related to the direct communication, or a sidelink configuration related to the sidelink communication, and wherein the sidelink configuration comprises at least one of a bearer configuration, layer 1 (L1) parameters, layer 2 (L2) parameters, or radio frequency (RF) parameters.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: transmitting, to the second wireless device, indication information for the context, and time information comprising the timer, wherein the indication information comprises at least one of a random number, an identity (ID) of the first wireless device, a source ID for the direct communication, or a destination ID for the direct communication.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: wherein a restoring of the context fails after an expiry of the timer.
8. The method of claim, 7, further comprising: receiving configuration information for a setup of the communication link; setting a new context storing the configuration information; and performing the direct communication with the second wireless device via the communication link based on the new context.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving, from the second wireless device, recovery information informing that the context is successfully restored by the second wireless device; and resuming the direct communication with the second wireless device via the communication link based on the context.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving, from the second wireless device, failure information informing that the context fails to be recovered by the second wireless device; and removing the context stored in the first wireless device.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising: receiving configuration information for a setup of the communication link; setting a new context storing the configuration information; and performing the direct communication with the second wireless device via the communication link based on the new context.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the context comprises at least one of a context of the first wireless device or a context of the second wireless device.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the wireless device is in communication with at least one of a user equipment, a network, and/or autonomous vehicles other than the wireless device.
14. A wireless device in a wireless communication system comprising: a transceiver; a memory; and at least one processor operatively coupled to the transceiver and the memory, and configured to: perform a direct communication with a second wireless device via a communication link based on a context stored in the first wireless device, detect a failure of the communication link upon which a timer starts, wherein the context remains stored in the first wireless device while the timer is running, and upon detecting a good quality of the communication link while the timer is running, control the transceiver to transmit information indicating a recovery of the communication link based on the context to the second wireless device.
15. A processor for a wireless device in a wireless communication system, wherein the processor is configured to control the wireless device to perform operations comprising: performing a direct communication with a second wireless device via a communication link based on a context stored in the first wireless device; detecting a failure of the communication link upon which a timer starts, wherein the context remains stored in the first wireless device while the timer is running; and upon detecting a good quality of the communication link while the timer is running, transmitting information indicating a recovery of the communication link based on the context to the second wireless device.
