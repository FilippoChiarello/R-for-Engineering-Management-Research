SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR RESOLVING HIDDEN FEATURES IN A FIELD OF VIEW
</title>

<abstract>
Implementations described and claimed herein provide systems and methods for object detection. In one implementation, thermal energy data in a long wavelength infrared band for a wide field of view is obtained. The thermal energy data is captured using at least one long wavelength infrared sensor of a sensor suite mounted to a vehicle. A foveated long wavelength infrared image is generated from the thermal energy data. The foveated long wavelength infrared image has a higher resolution concentrated in a designated region of the wide field of view and a lower resolution in a remaining region of the wide field of view. Emissivity and temperature data for the designated region is obtained by processing the foveated long wavelength infrared image. One or more features in the designated region are resolved using the emissivity and temperature data.

<claims>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method for object detection, the method comprising:
obtaining thermal energy data in a long wavelength infrared (LWIR) band with a wavelength ranging from 8-15 pm for a field of view, the thermal energy data captured using at least one LWIR sensor of a vehicle;
generating a foveated LWIR image from the thermal energy data, the foveated LWIR image having a first resolution concentrated in one or more designated regions of the field of view and a second resolution in a remaining region of the field of view, the first resolution being higher than the second resolution;
obtaining emissivity and temperature data for the one or more designated regions by processing the foveated LWIR image; and
resolving one or more features in the one or more designated regions using the emissivity and temperature data.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more designated regions includes extremities of the field of view and the remaining region includes a center of the field of view.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more designated regions includes a center of the field of view and the remaining region includes extremities of the field of view.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein resolving the one or more features includes determining that the one or more features correspond to a moving object based on a change in the emissivity and temperature data from the foveated LWIR image to a second foveated LWIR image.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein resolving the one or more features includes detecting and identifying an object in the one or more designated regions.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the object is identified based on a thermal profile generated from the emissivity and temperature data.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the object is identified through a comparison of the thermal profile with one or more reference thermal profiles.
8. The method of claim 5, wherein the object is identified by discriminating the emissivity and temperature data according to a relationship of at least one of emissivity or temperature with distance.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more features correspond to an object obscured by glare.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more features correspond to an object with diminished visibility caused by adverse light conditions.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein a depth of field is extended for the one or more features.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the depth of field is extended by fusing the foveated LWIR image with a second foveated LWIR image, the second foveated LWIR image
representing a perspective and a distance to the one or more features that are different from the first foveated LWIR image.
13. A system for object detection, the system comprising:
one or more sensors mounted to a vehicle, the one or more sensors including at least one long wavelength infrared (LWIR) sensor, the at least one LWIR sensor capturing thermal energy in a LWIR band for a field of view; and
an image signal processor resolving an object with diminished visibility in the field of view using emissivity and temperature data obtained from a foveated LWIR image, the foveated LWIR image having a first resolution concentrated in one or more designated regions of the field of view and a second resolution in a remaining region of the field of view, the first resolution being higher than the second resolution, the one or more designated regions including the object.
14. The system of claim 13, further comprising:
a vehicle controller executing at least one vehicle operation in response to the object being resolved.
15. The system of claim 14, wherein the at least one vehicle operation includes at least one of: presenting a notification of a presence of the object; controlling a direction of travel of the vehicle to avoid the object; slowing a speed of the vehicle; or directing at least one light source towards the one or more designated regions to illuminate the object.
16. The system of claim 13, wherein the one or more sensors further includes at least one of a monochromatic sensor or a light detection and ranging sensor that are co-boresight with the at least one LWIR sensor.
17. The system of claim 13, wherein the one or more sensors further includes one or more first sensors and one or more second sensors, the one or more first sensors having a first effective focal length of 35 mm or less, and the one or more second sensors having a second effective focal length of 85 mm or more.
18. The system of claim 13, wherein the image signal processor determines a distance to the object by extending a range of distance over which the object remains in focus.
19. One or more non-transitory computer-readable data storage media comprising
instructions that, when executed by at least one computing unit of a computing system, cause the computing system to perform operations comprising:
obtaining thermal energy data in a long wavelength infrared (LWIR) band for a field of view;
generating a foveated LWIR image from the thermal energy data, the foveated LWIR image having a first resolution concentrated in one or more designated regions of the field of view and a second resolution in a remaining region of the field of view, the first resolution being higher than the second resolution; detecting a presence of an object with diminished visibility based on at least one of emissivity or temperature of the thermal energy data exceeding a threshold in the one or more designated regions;
identifying the object based on a thermal profile generated from the thermal energy data.
20. The one or more non-transitory computer-readable data storage media of claim 19, wherein the object is identified based on a comparison of the thermal profile to one or more reference thermal profiles.
