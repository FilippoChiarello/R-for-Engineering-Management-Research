Adaptive stop sign and intersection traffic control system
</title>

<abstract>
An adaptive stop sign, includes an octagonal stop sign plate with at least one multicolor light indicator; a traffic signal control system (TSCS) and/or a signal receiver and controller (SRC) to control a state of the adaptive stop sign including an on state, an off state, an active state or an inactive state, and the at least one multicolor light indicator. In the active state, the adaptive stop sign works as a traffic control signal and the TSCS and/or SRC switches on the at least one multicolor light indicator according to a traffic control signal. In the inactive state the adaptive stop sign works as a normal stop sign and the TSCS and/or SRC switches off the at least one multicolor light indicator, and only a word STOP is visible.
