<title>
CHATBOT SUPPORT PLATFORM
</title>

<abstract>
A device receives, based on a user interaction with a chatbot, request data for a request for a service associated with a software tool that is part of a service management system. The device identifies, based on the request data, the service that is being requested and a first set of entity data for a first set of entities relating to the service. The device obtains a second set of entity data for a second set of entities by using an application programming interface (API) to reference a data structure that is associated with the service management system and that stores the second set of entity data. The device causes one or more components of the service management system to use the first set of entity data to execute a set of actions to perform the service.
