2. The agricultural transaction computing device of claim 1, wherein the processor is further programmed to: transmit, to the producer computing device associated with the selected match, a request for a crop status, the crop status comprising a crop health, and an estimated harvest date; and transmit, to the purchaser computing device associated with the selected match, the crop status.
3. The agricultural transaction computing device of claim 1, wherein the processor is further programmed to: receive, from the producer computing device associated with the selected match, a confirmation of the harvest date and an estimated crop status at harvest; and transmit, to the purchaser computing device associated with the selected match, the delivery date and the estimated crop status at harvest.
4. The agricultural transaction computing device of claim 1, wherein the at least one match rule comprises at least one of: the purchase price is greater than the offer price; the producer location is within a suitable distance of the purchaser location; the acreage is sufficiently large to produce the amount of crop; the at least one soil characteristic is capable of producing the at least one crop characteristic; the harvest time is before the delivery date; and the transportation capability is sufficient to transport the amount of crop from the producer location to the purchaser location by the delivery date.
5. The agricultural transaction computing device of claim 1, wherein the at least one business rule comprises at least one of: a maximum difference between the purchase price and the offer price; and at least one of a suitable credit history, customer satisfaction record, and active commercial relationship with suppliers of agricultural supplies.
6. A computer-implemented method for facilitating at least one transaction between at least one producer of an agricultural product and at least one purchaser of the agricultural product, the method implemented using an agricultural transaction computing device communicatively coupled to a plurality of data sources including at least one producer computing device and at least one purchaser computing device, the agricultural transaction computing device including a processor in communication with a memory device, the method comprising: receiving, from each of the at least one purchaser computing devices, a purchase request, the purchase request comprising at least one purchase parameter selected from a delivery date, a crop type, at least one crop characteristic, an amount of crop, a purchase price, and a purchaser location; receiving, from each of the at least one producer computing devices, a production offer, the production offer comprising at least one offer parameter selected from a harvest date, an acreage, at least one soil characteristic, a producer location, a planting capability, a storage capability, a transportation capability, and an offer price; comparing each purchase request to each production offer to determine at least one match according to at least one match rule, each match comprising one purchase request received from one of the at least one purchaser computing devices and one production offer received from the at least one producer computing devices; identifying a selected match from the at least one matches according to a business rule, the selected match comprising a selected purchase request and a selected production offer; generating a purchase contract comprising the purchase price, the amount of crop, and the delivery date; transmitting, to the purchaser computing device associated with the selected match, the purchase contract; generating a sale contract comprising the offer price, the amount of crop, the crop type, the at least one crop characteristic, the delivery date, and the purchaser location; transmitting, to the producer computing device associated with the selected match, the sale contract; receiving, from the purchaser computing device associated with the selected match, a purchaser consent to the purchase contract; receiving, from the producer computing device associated with the selected match, a producer consent to the sale contract; generating, in response to the purchaser consent and the producer consent, a message to initiate crop production and a message to confirm crop production; transmitting, to the producer computing device associated with the selected match, the message to initiate crop production; and transmitting, to the purchaser computing device associated with the selected match, the message to confirm crop production.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 6, further comprising: transmitting, to the producer computing device associated with the selected match, a request for a crop status, the crop status comprising a crop health, and an estimated harvest date; and transmitting, to the purchaser computing device associated with the selected match, the crop status.
8. The computer-implemented method of claim 6, further comprising: receiving, from the producer computing device associated with the selected match, a confirmation of the harvest date and an estimated crop status at harvest; and transmitting, to the purchaser computing device associated with the selected match, the delivery date and the estimated crop status at harvest.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 6, wherein the at least one match rule comprises at least one of: the purchase price is greater than the offer price; the producer location is within a suitable distance of the purchaser location; the acreage is sufficiently large to produce the amount of crop; the at least one soil characteristic is capable of producing the at least one crop characteristic; the harvest time is before the delivery date; and the transportation capability is sufficient to transport the amount of crop from the producer location to the purchaser location by the delivery date.
