Methods and systems for the industrial internet of things
</title>

<abstract>
The system generally includes a crosspoint switch in the local data collection system having multiple inputs and multiple outputs including a first input connected to the first sensor and a second input connected to the second sensor. The multiple outputs include a first output and a second output configured to be switchable between a condition in which the first output is configured to switch between delivery of the first sensor signal and the second sensor signal and a condition in which there is simultaneous delivery of the first sensor signal from the first output and the second sensor signal from the second output. Each of multiple inputs is configured to be individually assigned to any of the multiple outputs. Unassigned outputs are configured to be switched off producing a high-impedance state. The local data collection system includes multiple data acquisition units each having an onboard card set configured to store calibration information and maintenance history of a data acquisition unit in which the onboard card set is located.
