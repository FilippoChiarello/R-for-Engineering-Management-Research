<claims>
1. A transfer learning method executed by a computer, the method comprising: selecting learning data that satisfies a constraint identified from target learning data in a target domain and source learning data in a source domain for a transfer learning; and extracting the selected learning data among the source learning data as transfer data to be used as the target learning data.
2. The transfer learning method according to claim, wherein the method further comprising: acquiring target learning data input to a target learning machine so as to distinguish between a first label and a third label; acquiring source learning data input to a source learning machine so as to distinguish between the first label and a second label when a difference between the number of pieces of data of the third label of the target learning data and the number of pieces of learning data of the first label of the target learning data is larger than a preset number; extracting, from the acquired source learning data, learning data that satisfies a constraint identified from the same learning data indicating the first label of the target and the source; and performing learning based on the extracted learning data and the target learning data.
3. The transfer learning method according to claim 1, wherein the selecting includes generating a first constraint using first knowledge information given to the target domain including the target learning data, and the extracting includes extracting the transfer data from learning data constructing a constraint that is paired with and is the same type as the first constraint among constraints generated using second knowledge information given to the source domain including the source learning data.
4. The transfer learning method according to claim, wherein the method further comprising: detecting, from the target learning data, a second constraint whose conclusion is the same as a conclusion of the first constraint using the first knowledge information in the target; generating, from the source learning data, a third constraint that is the same type as the second constraint in the target; detecting, from the source learning data, a fourth constraint that is the same type as the third constraint in the source; and detecting learning data satisfying the third constraint or learning data satisfying the fourth constraint among the source learning data as the target learning data.
5. The transfer learning method according to claim 3, the method further comprising: generating the first constraint in the target and same type constraint paired with the first constraint in the source and extracting the transfer data, for each of a plurality of knowledge sources; and displaying a selection screen in which the knowledge source, the first constraint, the same type of constraint, and the transfer data are associated with each other.
6. The transfer learning method according to claim 5 executed by the computer, the method further comprising; acquiring the transfer data associated with the each knowledge source selected on the selection screen from the selected knowledge source, and executing the transfer learning as learning data.
7. A learning apparatus, comprising: a memory; and a processor coupled to the memory and the processor configured to: select learning data that satisfies a constraint identified from target learning data in a target domain and source learning data in a source domain for a transfer learning, and extract the selected learning data among the source learning data as transfer data to be used as the target learning data.
8. A computer-readable recording medium having stored therein a program that causes a computer to execute a learning process, the learning process comprising: selecting learning data that satisfies a constraint identified from target learning data in a target domain and source learning data in a source domain for a transfer learning; and extracting the selected learning data among the source learning data as transfer data to be used as the target learning data.
