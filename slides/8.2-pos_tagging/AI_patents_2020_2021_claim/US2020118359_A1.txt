REAL-TIME SELECTION OF DATA TO COLLECT IN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
A method for an autonomous vehicle includes: controlling at least one system of the vehicle by a host system; monitoring, by a memory device, data associated with operation of the vehicle; determining, by the memory device based on the monitoring, first data to collect from the vehicle; collecting, by the memory device independently of the host system, the first data; and storing, by the memory device, the collected first data in a non-volatile memory.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for an autonomous vehicle, the method comprising: controlling at least one system of the vehicle by a host system; monitoring, by a memory device, data associated with operation of the vehicle; determining, by the memory device based on the monitoring, first data to collect from the vehicle; collecting, by the memory device independently of the host system, the first data; and storing, by the memory device, the collected first data in a non-volatile memory.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first data is collected from volatile memory, and a multichip package includes the volatile memory and the non-volatile memory.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the multichip package further includes at least one sensor.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein monitoring the data associated with operation of the vehicle comprises monitoring data obtained from the at least one sensor.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one system comprises at least one sensor, and the first data is collected from the at least one sensor.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: determining, by the memory device independently of the host system, that an event has occurred, wherein determining that the event has occurred is based on monitoring the data associated with operation of the vehicle; and in response to determining that the event has occurred, collecting, by the memory device, second data from the vehicle.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the second data is collected from volatile memory.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the memory device comprises at least one sensor, and monitoring the data associated with operation of the vehicle comprises monitoring data collected by the at least one sensor.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein monitoring the data associated with operation of the vehicle further comprises receiving at least one signal from the host system.
10. The method of claim 8, further comprising: generating at least one code based on the at least one signal received from the host system; and associating the at least one code with the collected first data; wherein storing the collected first data comprises storing the at least one code in association with the collected first data.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the first data to collect comprises identifying a first system of the vehicle, and collecting the first data comprises collecting data from the first system.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein monitoring the data associated with operation of the vehicle comprises determining that an event has occurred, and collecting the first data is performed in response to determining that the event has occurred.
13. A memory device comprising: at least one sensor configured to collect sensor data from a vehicle; non-volatile memory configured to store data from at least one of the at least one sensor or a host system of the vehicle, wherein the host system controls at least one system of the vehicle; at least one computing device; and memory storing instructions configured to instruct the at least one computing device to: monitor data associated with operation of the vehicle; determine, based on the monitoring, first data to collect from the vehicle; collect the first data; and store the collected first data in the non-volatile memory.
14. The memory device of claim 13, wherein collecting the first data comprises obtaining the first data from at least one communications bus of the vehicle.
15. The memory device of claim 13, wherein data used by software is stored in system memory of the host system, and the first data comprises at least a portion of the data used by the software.
16. The memory device of claim 13, wherein the first data is collected from volatile memory, and a multichip package includes the volatile memory and the non-volatile memory.
17. The memory device of claim 16, wherein the multichip package further includes the at least one sensor.
18. A memory device comprising: at least one sensor; non-volatile memory; at least one computing device; and memory storing instructions configured to instruct the at least one computing device to: monitor data associated with operation of a vehicle; determine, based on the monitoring, first data to collect from the vehicle; collect the first data; and store the collected first data in the non-volatile memory.
19. The memory device of claim 18, wherein storing the collected first data comprises storing the collected first data at a predetermined location in the vehicle.
20. The memory device of claim 18, wherein the instructions are further configured to instruct the at least one computing device to determine a format based on monitoring the data associated with operation of the vehicle, and wherein storing the collected first data comprises formatting the collected first data into the format.
