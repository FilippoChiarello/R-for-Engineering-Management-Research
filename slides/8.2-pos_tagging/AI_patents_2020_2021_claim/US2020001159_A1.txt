INFORMATION PROCESSING APPARATUS, INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD, AND PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a novel and improved information processing apparatus capable of feeding back a running and walking state to a user in real time and being easily used. The information processing apparatus includes a sensing information acquisition unit that acquires sensing information from a single or a plurality of sensors worn on a body of a user who is running or walking, an estimation unit that estimates a grounding state of a foot of the user from the sensing information, and a notification unit that notifies information regarding a running and walking state of the user on the basis of the estimated grounding state.

<claims>
1. An information processing apparatus comprising: a sensing information acquisition unit configured to acquire sensing information from a single or a plurality of sensors worn on a body of a user who is running or walking; an estimation unit configured to estimate a grounding state of a foot of the user from the sensing information; and a notification unit configured to notify information regarding a running and walking state of the user on a basis of the estimated grounding state.
2. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the estimation unit estimates a position of a portion in a sole which has contact with ground first in each step regarding running and walking of the user as estimation of the grounding state.
3. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a storage unit configured to store relation information indicating a relation between the sensing information and the grounding state, wherein the estimation unit estimates the grounding state by using the relation information stored in the storage unit in advance.
4. The information processing apparatus according to claim 3, further comprising: a learning device configured to perform machine learning on the relation information.
5. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the estimation unit estimates muscle elastic characteristics of the foot of the user from the sensing information.
6. The information processing apparatus according to claim 5, wherein the estimation unit estimates elastic energy acquired in muscles of the foot of the user in each step regarding running and walking of the user as estimation of the muscle elastic characteristics.
7. The information processing apparatus according to claim 5, further comprising: a storage unit configured to store relation information indicating a relation between the sensing information and the muscle elastic characteristics, wherein the estimation unit estimates the muscle elastic characteristics by using the relation information stored in the storage unit in advance.

9. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: a determination unit configured to determine the running and walking state of the user on a basis of the estimated grounding state.
10. The information processing apparatus according to claim 9, wherein the determination unit determines the running and walking state of the user on a basis of a grounding time of the sole of the user in each step regarding running and walking of the user acquired from the sensing information.
11. The information processing apparatus according to claim 9, wherein the notification unit notifies a determination. result by the determination unit.
12. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the notification unit notifies the user who is walking or running of information regarding the running and walking state of the user in real time.
13. The information processing apparatus according to claim 12, wherein the notification unit makes a notification by performing at least one of control for making a voice output device worn on the body of the user output voice, control for making a vibration device worn on the body of the user vibrate, and control for making a display device worn on the body of the user display an image.
14. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the notification unit notifies another user other than the user of the information regarding the running and walking state of the user in real time.
15. The information processing apparatus according to claim 14, wherein the notification unit notifies the another user by performing control for making a terminal of the another user display an image.
16. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the notification unit notifies the user of an advice for improving the running and walking state selected on a basis of the estimated grounding state.
17. The information processing apparatus according to claim 16, wherein the notification unit selects a group corresponding to the running and walking state on a basis of the estimated grounding state and notifies the advice associated with the selected group.
18. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising: an imaging information acquisition unit configured to acquire imaging information from an imaging device that images the user who is running or walking, wherein the notification unit notifies the imaging information.
19. An information processing method comprising: acquiring sensing information from a single or a plurality of sensors worn on a body of a user who is running or walking; estimating a grounding state of a foot of the user from the sensing information; and notifying information regarding a running and walking state of the user on a basis of the estimated grounding state.
20. A program for making a computer implement: a function for acquiring sensing information from a single or a plurality of sensors worn on a body of a user who is running or walking; a function for estimating a grounding state of a foot of the user from the sensing information; and a function for notifying information regarding a running and walking state of the user on a basis of the estimated grounding state.
