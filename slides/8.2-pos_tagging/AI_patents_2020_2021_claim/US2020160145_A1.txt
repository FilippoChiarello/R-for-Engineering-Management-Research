</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments may relate to a system to be used in an oscillating neural network (ONN). The system may include a control node and a plurality of nodes wirelessly communicatively coupled with a control node. A node of the plurality of nodes may be configured to identify an oscillation frequency of the node based on a weight W and an input X. The node may further be configured to transmit a wireless signal to the control node, wherein a frequency of the wireless signal oscillates based on the identified oscillation frequency. Other embodiments may be described or claimed.
