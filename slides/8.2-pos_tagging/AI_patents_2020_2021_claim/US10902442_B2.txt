<title>
Managing adoption and compliance of series purchases
</title>

<abstract>
Methods, computer program products, and systems are presented. The methods include, for instance: identifying a target customer population of a series product and dividing into segments by customer behaviors relevant to adoption of and compliance to a series of purchases of the series product. A marketing campaign strategy for each segment is devised and executed, and adoption rate and compliance rate is predicted by analytical modeling and later evaluated by actual sales data. Parameters used in predicting the adoption rate and the compliance rate are adjusted for accuracy.
