Training a Deep Learning System to Detect Engine Knock with Accuracy Associated with High Fidelity Knock Detection Sensors Despite Using Data from a Low Fidelity Knock Detection Sensor
</title>

<abstract>
A system for training a deep learning system to detect engine knock with accuracy associated with high fidelity knock detection sensors despite using data from a low fidelity knock detection sensor. The system includes an engine, a high fidelity knock detection sensor, a low fidelity knock detection sensor, and an electronic processor. The electronic processor is configured to receive first data from the high fidelity knock detection sensor. The electronic processor is also configured to receive second data from the low fidelity knock detection sensor. The electronic processor is further configured to map the first data to the second data, train the deep learning system, using training data including the mapped data, to determine a predicted peak pressure using data from the low fidelity knock detection sensor, receive third data from the low fidelity knock detection sensor, and using the third data, determine the predicted peak pressure.
