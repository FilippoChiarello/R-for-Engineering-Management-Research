METHOD, APPARATUS AND ELECTRONIC DEVICE FOR IDENTIFYING RISKS PERTAINING TO TRANSACTIONS TO BE PROCESSED
</title>

<abstract>
A method for identifying a risk pertaining to a transaction to be processed, includes: identifying a risk pertaining to a transaction to be processed via a fast identification layer in a risk control system, thereby obtaining a first identification result; identifying a risk of interference pertaining to the transaction to be processed via a model for identifying transactions susceptible to interference, thereby obtaining a second identification result; and determining a processing manner for the transaction to be processed based on the first identification result and the second identification result, the processing manner including releasing the transaction to be processed, or further identifying the risk pertaining to the transaction to be processed via the in-depth identification layer in the risk control system.

<claims>
1. A method for identifying a risk pertaining to a transaction to be processed, comprising: identifying a risk pertaining to a transaction to be processed via a fast identification layer in a risk control system, thereby obtaining a first identification result; identifying a risk of interference pertaining to the transaction to be processed via a model for identifying transactions susceptible to interference, thereby obtaining a second identification result; and determining a processing manner for the transaction to be processed based on the first identification result and the second identification result, the processing manner including releasing the transaction to be processed, or further identifying the risk pertaining to the transaction to be processed via an in-depth identification layer in the risk control system.
2. The method according to claim 1, wherein the model for identifying transactions susceptible to interference is generated by machine learning based on positive samples and negative samples, the positive samples including interfered transactions, the negative samples including un-interfered transactions that are subject to no risks.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein when the model for identifying transactions susceptible to interference is in an initial state, the positive samples are obtained by weighted sampling all transactions in a specified historical period, wherein a weight of weighted sampling is negatively correlated to an interval between a sampling time and a time of a sampled transaction.
4. The method according to claim 3, wherein the weight of positive samples complies with the following formula:
description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?wi=e−ηαi description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"? where wi is the weight of an ith positive sample, η is a predefined adjustable parameter, and ai is an interval of the ith positive sample.
5. The method according to claim 3, wherein the negative samples are obtained by evenly sampling in all transactions in the specified historical period.
6. The method according to claim 2, wherein when the model for identifying transactions susceptible to interference is a newer version model obtained by updating an older version model, the positive samples comprise at least one of the following: interfered transactions not identified in the older version model, or interfered transactions identified in the older version model.
7. The method according to claim 6, the negative samples are obtained by evenly sampling in all transactions in a period in which the positive samples are.
8. The method according to claim 2, wherein a version of the model for identifying transactions susceptible to interference is updated according to a preset period.
9. The method according to claim 1, wherein determining the processing manner of the transaction to be processed based on the first identification result and the second identification result comprises: calculating a score of a decision function f(R, D) according to the following formula: f(R,D)=R·I(β>R>α)·e−D+I(R≥β), where R is a risk score included in the first identification result, D is an interference tendency score included in the second identification result, α and β are preset values and 0>(α, β)>1, a value of I(x) is 1 when condition x is met and 0 when condition x is not met; when f(R, D)<θ, the processing manner is releasing the transaction to be processed, and when θ<f(R,D)≤1, the in-depth identification layer in the risk control system further identifies the risk pertaining to the transaction to be processed; wherein θ is a preset threshold value, and 0<θ<1.
10. An electronic device, comprising: a processor; and a memory storing instructions executable by the processor; wherein the processor is configured to: identify a risk pertaining to a transaction to be processed via a fast identification layer in a risk control system, thereby obtaining a first identification result; identify a risk of interference pertaining to the transaction to be processed via a model for identifying transactions susceptible to interference, thereby obtaining a second identification result; and determine a processing manner for the transaction to be processed based on the first identification result and the second identification result, the processing manner including releasing the transaction to be processed, or further identifying the risk pertaining to the transaction to be processed via an in-depth identification layer in the risk control system.
11. The electronic device according to claim 10, wherein the model for identifying transactions susceptible to interference is generated by machine learning based on positive samples and negative samples, the positive samples including interfered transactions, the negative samples including un-interfered transactions that are subject to no risks.
12.
