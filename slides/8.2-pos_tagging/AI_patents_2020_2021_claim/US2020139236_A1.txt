DATABASE ESTABLISHMENT AND ANALYSIS METHOD FOR THE BEHAVIOR FROM GAME
</title>

<abstract>
The invention provides a database establishment and analysis method for the behavior from game. Through a team game playing, the invention records images and voices of the different participants during the process. The examiner may assess the action performance of each player. Furthermore, combining the analysis of images and voices with the assessment to generalize a plurality of behavioral characteristics and establishing a behavior database for data learning of a classification model. Said classification model can be used to establish image and sound analyses, as well as the adjustment benchmark of standards, and further provide reference objective evaluation in personnel management.

<claims>
1. A method for establishing a database of game behavior, the steps of which include: Step a1. provide an interactive game, includes a game session code (D), a total game time (T), a total number of players (P), and a game category (C); wherein the interactive game include a plurality of users participate in and a plurality of task instructions, when the plurality of users participate in the interactive game, the plurality of users play any role respectively, and achieve the plurality of task instructions respectively or jointly; Step a2. during the interactive game, obtain a time-varying image information (Video_Info(x, y, t), a time-varying image information of individual players (Player_Video), a time-varying sound information (Audio_Info(t)), a time-varying sound information of individual players (Player_Audio), a game history record (Game_Record(t)), a game history record of individual players (Player_Record), and a customer rating information (Evaluate_Info(p)); wherein the time-varying image information includes an x image coordinate, a y image coordinate; the time-varying image information further includes a game time (t) and a player code (p); Step a3. select a first user, identify the player individual time-varying image information (Player_Video) and the player individual time-varying sound information (Player_Audio) of the first user, calculating a behavior characteristic information (Behavior_Feature) to obtain the first user's behavior characteristic information and calculating a communication characteristic information (Communication_Feature) to obtain the first user's communication characteristic information; Step a4. the score of the first user is obtained from the customer rating information, integrated with the game history record of the same user, the behavior characteristic information and the communication characteristic information are recorded at the same time, a first behavior performance file of a behavior performance file (Behavior_Expression_Info) is created; Step a5. Selecting an "nth" user, and steps a3. to a4. are repeated till the "nth" user has created the behavior performance file, a behavior database is accessed and created; Step a6. Select "n" of the behavior databases, then extract a existing behavior recognition data model; Step a7. When new user's the behavior recognition data models are compared to the existing behavior recognition data model then extract a standard error file; and Step a8. When the standard error is less than or equal to a preset threshold, then add the new user's the behavior performance file to the behavior database.
2. The method defined in claim 1, the game history record includes a plurality of information record items, which steps include: b1. During the interactive game, the game event performed by the player based on the play rules is recorded, a game event record file is obtained: b2. During the interactive game, the game object moving and rotating behaviors of the player on the game table are recorded, a game object variation record file is obtained; b3. During the interactive game, the game events corresponding to the phasic change of game are recorded, a game schedule file is obtained; and b4. The files of the aforementioned steps are integrated into the game history record based on time.
3. As the method stated in claim 1, after the database of behavior from game is established, while the standard error is larger than the preset threshold, the data accumulation based result is fed back and the required data and rules in the establishment steps and behavior recognition data model content are influenced, the details of establishment steps are adjusted, comprising the following steps: c1. Adjust the marking standard of customer rating information. c2. Adjust the space conversion parameters based on data model in the behavior characteristic information. c3. Adjust the space conversion parameters based on data model in the communication characteristic information; and c4. Adjust the space conversion parameters based on data model in the behavior performance file.
4. The method defined in claim 1, the customer rating information has a plurality of test items, the steps thereof include: d1. select a first test item, quantify the behavioral characteristics information, the communication characteristics information and the scores of these first test items for different users, and obtain a first relationship; and d2. select a nth test item and repeat Step d1 until these test items establish their relationship.
5. The method defined in claim 4, these test items include an interactive behavior analysis, and the relationship is taken from the directional behavior of the user's behavioral information and the communication feature information.
6. The method defined in claim 4, these test items include a capability presentation analysis, and the relationship is taken from the spontaneous action of the user in the behavior characteristic information and the communication characteristic information.
7. The method defined in claim 4, wherein, the behavior characteristic information includes a head posture feature, a facial motion feature or a body posture feature.
8. The method defined in claim 4, wherein, the communication feature information includes an acoustic expression feature.
9. The method defined in claim 4, wherein, the relationship is obtained by pattern recognition and deep learning of Bi Long-Short Term Memory (BLSTM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN).
10. The steps of a game behavior analysis method include: e1. arrange a subject to participate in an interactive game with the plural roles and the plural task instructions, when the plural users participate in the interactive game, each user acts as one of the roles and achieves the task instructions respectively or jointly; e2. when the interactive game is going on, obtain a time-varying image information, a time-varying sound information and a customer rating information; e3. select the subject, identify the image and sound of the subject in the time-varying image information and the time-varying sound information, and obtain the first behavior characteristic information to be tested and the first communication characteristic information to be tested; and e4. from the behavior database described in Item 4 of the application scope, the relationship of the plural test items is obtained, and the information of the behavioral characteristics and the communication characteristics to be tested items are typed in to obtain the rating information of a subject.
