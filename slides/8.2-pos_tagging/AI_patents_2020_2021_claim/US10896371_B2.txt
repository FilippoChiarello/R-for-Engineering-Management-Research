<title>
Multi-dimensional time series event prediction via convolutional neural network(s)
</title>

<abstract>
Techniques that facilitate machine learning using multi-dimensional time series data are provided. In one example, a system includes a snapshot component and a machine learning component. The snapshot component generates a first sequence of multi-dimensional time series data and a second sequence of multi-dimensional time series data from multi-dimensional time series data associated with at least two different data types generated by a data system over a consecutive period of time. The machine learning component that analyzes the first sequence of multi-dimensional time series data and the second sequence of multi-dimensional time series data using a convolutional neural network system to predict an event associated with the multi-dimensional time series data.
