9. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the outputting includes outputting an alert based on a determining that an alert condition is present and wherein the outputting includes determining that an alert condition is present by determining that a message profile of a received textual based message having the textual based message data matches a registered priority message profile of a set a registered priority message profiles, wherein the method includes activating a machine learning process to register a message profile of a received message as registered priority message profile based on a reply to the received message provided by the second user satisfying a criteria, the criteria being based on a speed of the reply.
10. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the outputting includes outputting an alert based on a determining that an alert condition is present and wherein the outputting includes determining that an alert condition is present by determining that a message profile of a received textual based message having the textual based message data matches a registered priority message profile of a set a registered priority message profiles, wherein the method includes activating a machine learning process to register a message profile of a received message as registered priority message profile based on a reply to the received message provided by the second user satisfying a criteria, the criteria being based on received forces received by a manually operated user interface used by the second user to enter a reply message of the reply.
