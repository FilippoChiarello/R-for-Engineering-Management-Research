</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein are methods for identifying patients with pancreatic cancer and subjects at risk for developing pancreatic cancer, methods for monitoring a patient with an identified pancreatic lesion, methods for evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment used for a patient with pancreatic cancer, and methods for selecting a therapy for treating pancreatic cancer in a particular patient. The invention makes use of hydroxymethylation biomarkers, which in combination with one or more clinical parameters and optionally one or more additional types of biomarkers and/or patient-specific risk factors, exhibit a hydroxymethylation level that correlates with pancreatic cancer. Kits and other methods of use are also provided.

(d) comparing, at each locus, the hydroxymethylation level of the sample with the hydroxymethylation level in the reference profile, to ascertain differences in
hydroxymethylation levels between the sample and the reference profile for each biomarker; and
(e) calculating an index value representing the likelihood that the individual has pancreatic cancer from the comparison in step (d).
78. The method of claim 77, further including, prior to step (a), identifying the individual as being at risk for developing pancreatic cancer from one or more parameters selected from: an identified pancreatic lesion; pancreatic inflammation; jaundice; age; weight; gender; ethnicity; family history; genetic mutations; diabetes; physical activity; diet; proinflammatory cytokine levels; and cigarette smoking.
79. The method of claim 77, further including determining the likelihood that the individual has at least one additional type of cancer.
80. The method of claim 79, wherein the at least one additional type of cancer is selected from: bladder cancer; cancers of the blood and bone marrow; brain cancer; breast cancer; cervical cancer; colorectal cancer; esophageal cancer; liver cancer; lung cancer; ovarian cancer; prostate cancer; renal cancer; skin cancer; testicular cancer; thyroid cancer; and uterine cancer.
81. In a multi-cancer test that determines the likelihood that an individual has pancreatic cancer and at least one additional type of cancer selected from colorectal, esophageal, lung, and liver cancer, the improvement which comprises determining the likelihood that the individual has pancreatic cancer by:
(a) obtaining a cell-free DNA sample from the individual;
(b) enriching for hydroxymethylated DNA in the sample;
(c) quantifying the nucleic acids in the enriched sample that map to each of a plurality of selected loci in a reference hydroxymethylation profile, wherein each selected locus comprises a hydroxymethylation biomarker;
(d) comparing, at each locus, the hydroxymethylation level of the sample with the hydroxymethylation level in the reference profile, to ascertain differences in
hydroxymethylation levels between the sample and the reference profile for each biomarker; and
(e) calculating an index value representing the likelihood that the individual has pancreatic cancer from the comparison in step (d).
82. The improved multi-cancer test of claim 81, further including eliminating false positives for the at least one additional type of cancer prior to (a).
83. The improved multi-cancer test of claim 81, further including eliminating false negatives for the at least one additional type of cancer prior to (a).
84. A kit for carrying out the method of claim 77, comprising: at least one reagent for the determination of hydroxymethylation level at each of a plurality of hydroxymethylation biomarker loci in a cell-free DNA sample;
a solid support for capturing affinity-tagged 5hmC-containing cell-free DNA in the sample; and
written instructions for the use of the at least one reagent and the solid support in carrying out the method.
85. The kit of claim 84, further including instructions for accessing and using software designed to perform modeling and prediction.
86. A kit for carrying out the method of claim 77, comprising:
a DNA b-glucosyl transferase;
UDP glucose modified with a chemoselective group;
a biotin moiety;
a solid support having a surface functionalized with a biotin-binding protein; an adaptor comprising a molecular barcode; and
written instructions for carrying out the method.
87. The kit of claim 86, further including instructions for accessing and using software designed to perform modeling and prediction.
