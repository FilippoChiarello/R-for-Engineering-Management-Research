ABNORMALITY DETECTION DEVICE, ABNORMALITY DETECTION METHOD, AND STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
An abnormality detection device according to an embodiment includes a detector, a remover, and a learner. The detector detects first abnormal data in detection target data which is an abnormality detection target by inputting the detection target data to a first autoencoder which performed learning based on first learning target data which is a learning target. The remover removes data associated with the first abnormal data from the first learning target data to generate second learning target data by inputting the first learning target data to a second autoencoder which performed learning based on the first abnormal data detected by the detector. The learner causes the first autoencoder to perform learning based on the second learning target data generated by the remover.
