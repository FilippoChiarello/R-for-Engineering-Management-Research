METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein are methods and systems for determining microsatellite instability. In some embodiments, the disclosed methods and systems are used for determining whether a cancer patient has high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). MSI-H patients have remarkably good responses to immunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors immunotherapy. Therefore, the disclosed methods and systems can be used for identifying MSI-H and thus, patients as candidates for immunotherapy. In turn, the disclosed methods and systems can be used to predict responsiveness to immunotherapy. In some embodiments, the methods further include providing an immunotherapy to the MSI-H patient. Also disclosed are vaccines and compositions.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method of identifying microsatellite instability status, comprising:
applying an antibody containing fluid sample to a frame shift peptide array comprising peptides selected from frameshifts created by insertion or deletions in microsatellites and/or frameshifts created by mis-splicing of exons and associated with microsatellite instability (MSI), wherein the peptides have the sequence with 8 or more contiguous amino acids of the frameshift sequences provided in Tables 2 and 3; and
analyzing binding of the antibody to the peptides associated with MSI, thereby identifying microsatellite instability status of the sample by comparing the relative binding of antibodies to the peptides on the array.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the array comprises one or more peptides having the sequence with 8 or more contiguous amino acids of the frameshift sequences according to SEQ ID NOs: 81-155.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the array consists essentially of peptides having the sequence with 8 or more contiguous amino acids of the frameshift sequences according to one of SEQ ID NOs: 81-155.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the array consists of peptides having sequences with 8 or more contiguous amino acids of the frameshift sequences according to SEQ ID NOs: 81-155.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the peptides are 8-30 amino acids in length.
6. The method of any one of claims 2-5, wherein analyzing comprises adding total fluorescent values of each peptide comprising the frameshift and counting those above a threshold to effect a diagnosis.
7. The method of any one of claims 1-6, further comprising obtaining the antibody containing fluid sample from a subject.
8 The method of claim 7, wherein the subject is a human.
9. The method of claim 7, wherein the subject is a dog.
10. The method of any one of claims 1-9, wherein the antibody containing fluid sample is blood, plasma or saliva.
11. The method of any one of claims 1-10, wherein analyzing comprises classifying the sample as MSI-high, MSI-low or MS-Stable.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein detection of high MSI indicates the sample would respond to checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) immunotherapy.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising administering an CPI immunotherapy to the subject with high MSI.
14. The method of claim 12 or 13, wherein CPI immunotherapy targets CTLA4, PD-1, and/or PD-L1.
15. A method of identifying microsatellite instability status (MSI), comprising: applying an antibody containing fluid sample to an ELISA comprising peptides selected from frameshifts created by insertion or deletions in microsatellites and/or frameshifts created by mis-splicing of exons and associated with microsatellite instability (MSI), wherein the peptides have the sequence with 8 or more contiguous amino acids of the frameshift sequences provided in Table 1; and
analyzing binding of the antibody to the peptides associated with MSI, thereby identifying microsatellite instability status of the sample by comparing the relative binding of antibodies to the peptides.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the ELISA comprises peptides set forth in Table 1 with SEQ ID NOs: 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 18, 19, 21, 24, 27, 32, 41, 44, 49, 52, 56, 63, 67, 68, 71 and 72 to identify MSI f7. The method of claim 15 or claim 16, further comprising obtaining the antibody containing fluid sample from a subject.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the subject is a human.
19. The method of claim 17, wherein the subject is a dog.
20. The method of any one of claims 15-19, wherein the antibody containing fluid sample is blood, plasma or saliva.
21. The method of any one of claims 15-20, wherein analyzing comprises classifying the sample as MSI-high, MSI-low or MS-Stable.
22. The method of claim 21, wherein detection of high MSI indicates the sample would respond to checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) immunotherapy.
23. The method of claim 22, further comprising administering an CPI immunotherapy to the subject with high MSI.
24. The method of claim 22 or 23, wherein CPI immunotherapy targets CTLA4, PD-1, and/or PD-L1.
25. A vaccine, comprising:
one or more peptides having the sequence according to one provided in Table 2 and/or 3 and/or a nucleic acid capable of expressing the one or more peptides and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
26. The vaccine of claim 25, further comprising an adjuvant.
27. The vaccine of claims 25 or 26, wherein the vaccine comprises one or more vectors expressing the peptides according to Tables 2 and/or 3.
28. The vaccine of claim 27, wherein the amino acid sequences are separated by a peptide linker.
29. A method of treating and/or inhibiting a MSI-H cancer or tumor in a subject, comprising
administering to the subject the vaccine of any one of claims 25-28.
30. The method of claim 29, wherein the method further comprises administering an additional therapeutic agent.
31. The method of claim 30, wherein the additional therapeutic agent is a CPI.
32. A method of eliciting an immune response in a subject with a MSI-H cancer or tumor, comprising
