<title>
Machine Learning Systems and Methods For Assessing Medical Interventions For Utilization Review
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods are disclosed for determining the appropriateness of medical interventions. In one embodiment, a machine learning system for determining the appropriateness of a selected medical intervention includes health-related data sources, the health-related data sources providing at least one data file of a first type, and a second data file of a second type. A machine learning module is configured to receive the first and second data files, perform a normalization procedure on at least one of the first and second data files, and apply at least one previously trained machine learning model to the normalized data files to produce a prediction output. The prediction output may include a confidence level associated with an appropriateness of the selected medical intervention.

<claims>
1. A machine learning system for determining the appropriateness of a selected medical intervention, the system comprising: a plurality of health-related data sources, the health-related data sources providing at least one data file of a first type, and a second data file of a second type; a normalization module, including a processor, configured to receive the first and second data files and perform a normalization procedure on at least one of the first and second data files; and a previously trained machine learning model configured to receive the normalized data files and, via the processor, produce a prediction output, wherein the prediction output includes a confidence level associated with an appropriateness of the selected medical intervention, wherein the previously trained machine learning model is trained based on a population of patients that have previously undergone the selected medical intervention.
2. The machine learning system of claim 1, wherein the at least one machine learning model is an artificial neural network.
3. The machine learning system of claim 1, wherein the at least one machine learning model is a probabilistic neural network.
4. The machine learning system of claim 1, wherein the at least one machine learning model is a convolutional neural network.
5. The machine learning system of claim 1, wherein the at least one machine learning model is a decision tree.
6. The machine learning system of claim 1, wherein the first data file is a two-dimensional image file, and the normalization procedure includes producing an input vector based on the two-dimensional image file.
7. The machine learning system of claim 6, wherein the two-dimensional image file is selected from the group comprising an X-ray image, a cat-scan (CT) image, and a magnetic resonance image (MRI).
8. The machine learning system of claim 1, wherein the first data file is a time-varying real value parameter, and the normalization procedure produces an input vector based on the time-varying real value parameter.
9. The machine learning system of claim 8, wherein the time-varying real value parameter is a heart-beat audio file.
10. The machine learning system of claim 8, wherein the time-varying real parameter is a spoken utterance.
11. The machine learning system of claim 1, wherein the first data file is a text file, and the normalization procedure includes producing an input vector by applying natural language processing (NLP) to the text file.
12. The machine learning system of claim 1, wherein the prediction output is further processed to determine a selected health-care provider for the selected medical intervention.
13. The machine learning system of claim 1, wherein the data sources are selected from the group consisting of diagnostic image sources, radiological reports, lab studies, exam findings, survey results, and office notes.
14. A method for determining the appropriateness of a selected medical intervention utilizing a machine learning system, the method comprising: receiving, from a plurality of health-related data sources, at least one data file of a first type, and a second data file of a second type; performing, with a processor, a normalization procedure on at least one of the first and second data files; and applying at least one previously trained machine learning model to the normalized data files to produce a prediction output; wherein the prediction output includes a confidence level associated with an appropriateness of the selected medical intervention, wherein the previously trained machine learning model is trained based on a population of patients that have previously undergone the selected medical intervention.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the at least one machine learning model is an artificial neural network.
16. The method of claim 14, wherein the at least one machine learning model is a probabilistic neural network.
