LOSSY SIGNIFICANCE COMPRESSION WITH LOSSY RESTORATION
</title>

<abstract>
Described are systems and methods for lossy compression and restoration of data. The raw data is first truncated. Then the truncated data is compressed. The compressed truncated data can then be efficiently stored and/or transmitted using fewer bits. To restore the data, the compressed data is then decompressed and restoration bits are concatenated. The restoration bits are selected to compensate for statistical biasing introduced by the truncation.

<claims>
1. A data storage and retrieval method comprising: receiving data; truncating a predetermined number of bits of the data to form truncated data; compressing the truncated data to from compressed data; and storing the compressed data in a memory or transmitting the compressed data to a receiving system.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: retrieving the compressed data; decompressing the compressed data to form decompressed truncated data; and concatenating restoration bits to the decompressed truncated data to form restored data.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the restoration bits are selected by sampling from a statistical distribution.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the statistical distribution is a non-parametric distribution.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the non-parametric distribution is determined based on previously restored data.
6. The method of claim 3, wherein the statistical distribution is a parametric distribution.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the parametric distribution is determined based on previously restored data.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the predetermined number of bits is determined based on previously compressed data or a desired level of noise.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving the predetermined number of bits via a software passed argument.
10. A data storage and retrieval system comprising: a memory; and a processor communicatively coupled to the memory, wherein the processor: retrieves data from the memory, truncates a predetermined number of bits of the data to form truncated data; compresses the truncated data to from compressed data; and stores the compressed data in the memory or transmits the compressed data to a receiving system.
11. The system of claim 10, where in the processor further: retrieves the compressed data; decompresses the compressed data to form decompressed truncated data; and concatenates restoration bits to the decompressed truncated data to form restored data.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the restoration bits are selected by sampling from a statistical distribution.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the statistical distribution is a non-parametric distribution.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the non-parametric distribution is determined based on previously restored data.
15. The system of claim 12, wherein the statistical distribution is a parametric distribution.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the parametric distribution is determined based on previously restored data.
17. The system of claim 10, wherein the predetermined number of bits is determined based on previously compressed data or a desired level of noise.
18. The system of claim 10, wherein the processor further: receiving the predetermined number of bits via a software passed argument.
19. A non-transitory computer readable storage medium storing instructions, that when executed by a processor cause the processor to: retrieve data from a memory, truncate a predetermined number of bits of the data to form truncated data; compress the truncated data to from compressed data; and store the compressed data in the memory or transmit the compressed data to a receiving system.
20. The non-transitory computer readable storage medium of claim 19, wherein the instructions further cause the processor to: retrieve the compressed data; decompress the compressed data to form decompressed truncated data; and concatenate restoration bits to the decompressed truncated data to form restored data.
