Calculus for Collaborative Online Commerce
</title>

<abstract>
Calculus for collaborative online commerce is provided. An input is received to generate a group of online shopping members based on product category of online shopping. Product purchasing affinity quotients of members in a member group corresponding to the product category of online shopping are retrieved from a member group database. A set of members is selected in the member group having a product purchasing affinity quotient above a defined affinity quotient threshold level corresponding to the product category of online shopping. The group of online shopping members is generated based on the set of members in the member group having product purchasing affinity quotients above the defined affinity quotient threshold level corresponding to the product category of online shopping.
