USING MACHINE LEARNING TO PREDICT USER PROFILE AFFINITY BASED ON BEHAVIORAL DATA ANALYTICS
</title>

<abstract>
A behavioral analytics platform may obtain a first data set associated with a first user and a second data set associated with a second user. The behavioral analytics platform may determine a first set of behavioral categories to classify the historical user activity data associated with the first user based on a first set of behavior vectors and determine a second set of behavioral categories to classify the historical user activity data associated with the second user based on a second set of behavior vectors. The behavioral analytics platform may populate one or more user interfaces that are accessible to the first user and/or the second user based on one or more values representing a degree to which the first set of behavioral categories and the second set of behavioral categories correspond to complementary behavioral tendencies, which may be determined using a machine learning technique.
