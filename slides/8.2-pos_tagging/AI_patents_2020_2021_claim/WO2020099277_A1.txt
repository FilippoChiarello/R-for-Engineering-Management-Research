GENE SIGNATURES FOR THE PREDICTION OF PROSTATE CANCER RECURRENCE
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are gene signatures and methods for predicting the recurrence of prostate cancer in prostatectomized subjects. Other objectives of the invention are assay devices and kits for determining the expression levels of specific gene sets correlated to prostate cancer recurrence.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of predicting the recurrence of prostate cancer in a prostatectomized subject, the method comprising:
(1) detecting in a prostate tissue sample from said subject the transcription expression levels of all the genes from the following gene panel: ACADVL, CARHSP1, CNTNAP1, DNASE 1L2, RNF103, SEZ6L, SLC22A6, UGGT2, WDR52;
(2) determining the expression levels of the same genes in reference tissue samples thereby providing an expression profile map for the recurrent and non-recurrent populations;
(3) subjecting the expression levels detected in the subject and those detected in the reference samples to an algorithm,
whereby the outcome of said algorithm is predictive of prostate cancer recurrence in said subject.
2. A method according to claim 1, wherein said gene panel further comprises one or more of the following genes: ATP5D, C14orfl 09, CCDC144A, CDH15, CELSR3, DDX5, EHD4, EPHB3, LOC100508936, PABPC1, PIP4K2C, PLCG1.
3. A method according to claim 2, wherein said gene panel is selected from the group consisting of:
(a) ACADVL, CARHSP1, CNTNAP1, DNASE 1L2, RNF103, SEZ6L, SLC22A6, UGGT2, WDR52;
(b) ACADVL, CARHSP1, CCDC144A, CNTNAP1, DDX5, DNASE 1L2, EHD4, PIP4K2C, RNF103, SEZ6L, SLC22A6, UGGT2, WDR52;
(c) ACADVL, C14orfl 09, CARHSP1, CCDC144A, CDH15, CELSR3,
CNTNAP1, DDX5, DNASE 1L2, EHD4, PABPC1, PIP4K2C, RNF103, SEZ6L, SLC22A6, UGGT2, WDR52; and
(d) ACADVL, ATP5D, C14orfl 09, CARHSP1, CCDC144A, CDH15, CELSR3, CNTNAP1, DDX5, DNASE 1L2, EHD4, EPHB3, LOC100508936, PABPC1, PIP4K2C, PLCG1, RNF103, SEZ6L, SLC22A6, UGGT2, WDR52.
4. A method according to claim 1 , wherein the subj ect has been previously treated with a surgical procedure for partial or complete removal of prostate cancer.
5. A method according to claims 1 and 4, wherein the tissue sample from the subject is a prostate tissue sample taken from surgically removed prostate.
6. A method according to claim 1, wherein the reference tissue samples are samples of prostate tissue taken from surgically removed prostate of previously-prostatectomized patients with known prostate cancer outcome.
7. A method according to claim 6, wherein said outcome is positive with no metastatic processes arising after prostatectomy and thereby such previously-prostatectomized patients form a non-recurrent population.
8. A method according to claim 6, wherein said outcome is negative with metastases arising after prostatectomy and thereby such previously-prostatectomized patients form a recurrent population.
9. A method according to claims 6-8, wherein the number of reference samples from patients with positive or negative outcome is substantially equivalent.
10. A method according to claim 1, wherein said algorithm is a multivariate classification analysis .
11. A method according to claim 10, wherein said multivariate classification analysis is selected from Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and K-Nearest Neighbors method (KNN).
12. A method according to claims 1-11, wherein the transcription expression levels are determined by microarray analysis.
13. An assay device for carrying out the methods of claims 1-11, which is an array containing a solid support carrying multiple polynucleotide probes consisting of sequences complementary and/or hybridizable to the mRNAs of the genes identified in the preceding claims.
14. A gene signature for predicting prostate cancer recurrence, which is selected from:
- ACADVL, CARHSP1, CNTNAP1, DNASE 1L2, RNF103, SEZ6L, SLC22A6, UGGT2, WDR52,
- ACADVL, CARHSP1, CCDC144A, CNTNAP1, DDX5, DNASE 1L2, EHD4, PIP4K2C, RNF103, SEZ6L, SLC22A6, UGGT2, WDR52;
- ACADVL, C14orfl 09, CARHSP1, CCDC144A, CDH15, CELSR3, CNTNAP1, DDX5, DNASE 1L2, EHD4, PABPC1, PIP4K2C, RNF103, SEZ6L, SLC22A6, UGGT2, WDR52;
- ACADVL, ATP5D, C14orfl 09, CARHSP1, CCDC144A, CDH15, CELSR3, CNTNAP1, DDX5, DNASE 1L2, EHD4, EPHB3, LOC100508936, PABPC1,
PIP4K2C, PLCG1, RNF103, SEZ6L, SLC22A6, UGGT2, WDR52.
15. The use of a gene signature according to claim 14 or an assay device according to claim 13 for determining the risk of prostate cancer recurrence in a prostatectomized subject.
