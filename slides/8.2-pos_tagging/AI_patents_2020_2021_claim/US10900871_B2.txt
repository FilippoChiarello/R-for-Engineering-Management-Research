<title>
Method for estimating the reliability of measurements by wheel sensors of a vehicle and system for its application
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for evaluating the reliability of data supplied by multi-function WFC sensors of tires of wheels of a vehicle for targeted applications, on the basis of the irregularities of the road, which use displacement data sent from the road handling adaptation equipment of the vehicle, enabling the variations in the road condition to be reflected. The system includes equipment for monitoring the wheel displacement data for adapting it to the variations of profile of the road on which it is traveling, in order to maintain a stable body position. The monitoring equipment is linked to the WFC sensors via a central processing unit which is capable of correlating data supplied by the WFC sensors and values of wheel displacement data supplied by the monitoring equipment for the purpose of weighting the values of at least one parameter obtained from the data delivered by the WFC sensors.

<claims>
1. A method for estimating the reliability of measurements made periodically by multi-function Wheel Fitted Component (WFC) sensors of tires for wheels of a vehicle traveling on a road, the method comprising, in succession: a step of extracting, from a monitoring system configured to monitor the vehicle in a given environment for the purpose of adapting a behavior of the vehicle to the given environment, periodic wheel displacement data on vehicle body displacement heights at a position of each wheel, indicating a state of variations of a profile of the road on which the vehicle is traveling, the monitoring system being separate from the WFC sensors; a step of correlating the periodic wheel displacement data with values of at least one parameter sensitive to the variations in the profile of the road for an application of the WFC sensors to obtain a correlation, the parameter being a footprint length of the respective wheel, the values being deduced from the measurements made by the WFC sensors on each wheel at a same instant; a step of using decision criteria to deduce a decision on a reliability of a given set of values of the parameter that is the footprint length of the respective wheel deduced from measurements of the WFC sensors based on the correlation between the periodic wheel displacement data and the values of the parameter; and a step of performing one of (1) determining wheel location, (2) detecting one or more of overload and wear of the tires, (3) performing automatic training of the WFC sensors, and (4) monitoring positions of the WFC sensors using the given set of values of the parameter and the decision on the reliability of the given set of values.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the monitoring system comprises displacement sensors separate from the wheels and configured to measure an overall displacement of the vehicle.
3. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of correlating comprises determining variations in at least two values of the periodic wheel displacement data, determining variations in at least two values of the at least one parameter, and determining a correlation of the periodic wheel displacement data with the values of the at least one parameter sensitive to the variations in the profile of the road for the application of the WFC sensors, based on the determined periodic wheel displacement data variations and the parameter variations.
4. A system for estimating the reliability of measurements made periodically by multi-function Wheel Fitted Component (WFC) sensors of tires for wheels of a vehicle capable of traveling on a road and transmitted in the form of digital signals to a central processing unit for the application of the method according to claim 1, the system comprising: the monitoring system configured to monitor the wheel displacement data for adapting the system to the variations in the profile of the road on which the vehicle is traveling in order to maintain a stable body position by feedback control, the monitoring system being linked to the WFC sensors via the central processing unit which is configured to correlate the data supplied by the WFC sensors and the values of the wheel displacement data supplied by the monitoring system to weight the values of the at least one parameter obtained from the measurements delivered by the WFC sensors to indicate the reliability of the measurements.
5. The system for estimating the reliability of measurements as claimed in claim 4, wherein the monitoring system is selected from among a suspension control system of the vehicle, which indirectly supplies monitoring data on the state of the road, and a system of stereoscopic cameras, at least one radar system, and a laser sensor which directly supply data on the surface state of the road.
