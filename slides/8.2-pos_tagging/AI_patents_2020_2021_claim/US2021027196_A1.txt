BLOCKCHAIN-BASED TRAINING DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR TRUSTED MODEL IMPROVEMENTS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods disclosed herein are directed to blockchain-based training data management systems and methods for trusted improvements of models. Embodiments provide for the generation of metadata and smart contracts associated with certain data, using a blockchain to store the generated metadata and smart contracts, and curating training data for the improvement of the models utilizing the generated metadata and smart contract stored in the blockchain.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented system for managing the curation of training data that is used to train a computer model, wherein the training data comprises a plurality of electronic documents, the system comprising: at least one computer processor, wherein the at least one computer processor is programmed with software to: generate a smart contract and metadata associated with at least one electronic document, wherein the metadata specifies a curation status for the at least one electronic document; transmit the smart contract and the metadata to a blockchain for storage in a block on the blockchain, wherein the blockchain comprises a plurality of nodes operating on computer servers, wherein the nodes are connected via a network; and train the computer model using the at least one document as training data based on the smart contract and metadata in the blockchain.
2. The system according to claim 1, further comprising: an electronic database, wherein the electronic database is configured to store the at least one electronic document.
3. The system according to claim 2, wherein the blockchain includes a ledger configured to maintain an audit trail of events associated with the at least one electronic document stored in the electronic database.
4. The system according to claim 2, wherein the at least one computer processor is further configured to store the at least one electronic document in the electronic database without generating a corresponding smart contract and metadata based on a determination that a number of errors associated with the at least one electronic document is less than a threshold number.
5. The system according to claim 1, wherein the at least one computer processor is further configured to apply the computer model onto the at least one electronic document and extract a plurality of attributes from the at least one electronic document.
6. The system according to claim 5, wherein the at least one computer processor is further configured to generate a second computer model based on the training data.
7. The system according to claim 1, wherein the smart contract controls document access to the at least one electronic document.
8. The system according to claim 1, wherein the metadata further specifies: (i) whether the at least one electronic document is associated with one of a retention policy or purge policy and (ii) keys to at least one of: access, open, and read the at least one electronic document.
9. The system according to claim 1, wherein the at least one computer processor is further configured to apply at least one of a bias mitigation algorithm, a preservation script, and a retention script on the training data.
10. A computer-implemented method for managing the curation of training data that is used to train a computer model, wherein the training data comprises a plurality of electronic documents, the method comprising: generating, with at least one computer processor, a smart contract and metadata associated with at least one electronic document, wherein the metadata specifies a curation status for the at least one electronic document; transmitting, with the at least one computer processor, the smart contract and the metadata to a blockchain for storage in a block on the blockchain, wherein the blockchain comprises a plurality of nodes operating on computer servers, wherein the nodes are connected via a network; and training, with the at least one computer processor, the computer model using the at least one document as training data based on the smart contract and metadata in the blockchain.
11. The method according to claim 10, further comprising: storing, with the at least one computer processor, the at least one electronic document in an electronic database.
12. The method according to claim 11, wherein the blockchain includes a ledger configured to maintain an audit trail of events associated with the at least one electronic document stored in the electronic database.
13. The method according to claim 11, further comprising: upon determining, with the at least one computer processor, that a number of errors associated with the at least one electronic document is less than a threshold number, storing the at least one electronic document in the database without generating a corresponding smart contract and metadata.
14. The method according to claim 10, further comprising: applying, with the at least one computer processor, the computer model onto the at least one electronic document; and extracting, with the at least one computer processor, a plurality of attributes from the at least one electronic document.
15. The method according to claim 14, further comprising: generating, with the at least one computer processor, a second computer model based on the training data.
16. The method according to claim 10, wherein the smart contract controls document access to the at least one electronic document.
17. The method according to claim 10, wherein the metadata further specifies: (i) whether the at least one electronic document is associated with one of a retention policy or purge policy and (ii) keys to at least one of: access, open, and read the at least one electronic document.
18. The method according to claim 10, further comprising: applying, with the at least one computer processor, at least one of a bias mitigation algorithm, a preservation script, and a retention script on the training data.
