METHOD FOR INITIATING AND HOSTING AN AUCTION FOR A SECURITY
</title>

<abstract>
One variation of a method for initiating and hosting an auction for a security includes: accessing historical trade data and characteristics of a corpus of securities traded on an auction platform; assigning post-auction liquidity scores to the corpus of securities based on historical trading result data; constructing a liquidity model representing correlations between characteristics and pre-auction liquidity scores of the corpus of securities; accessing characteristics of a security held by a seller; calculating a liquidity score of the security based on characteristics of the security and the liquidity model; assigning a rule profile—defining rules for distribution of feedback to bidders during an auction—to the security based on the liquidity score of the security; initiating an auction for the security on the auction platform; and, during the auction, distributing feedback for bids according to the rule profile.
