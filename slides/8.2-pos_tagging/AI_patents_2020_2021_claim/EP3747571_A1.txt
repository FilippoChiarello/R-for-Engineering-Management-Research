<title>
POWDER BED FUSION MONITORING
</title>

<abstract>
A method of monitoring an additive manufacturing build process includes first and second phases. The first phase includes depositing a powder layer onto a powder bed (14). A topographical profile (36) of the powder bed (14) is captured with a profilometer (24, 24'). An image (38) of the powder bed (14) is captured with a camera (26). The image (38) and topographical profile (36) are combined to create a data set (40) that is transferred to a machine learning algorithm. A set of training data is generated and includes a set of deviations from a nominal model. The second phase includes depositing a powder layer onto the powder bed (14). An image (38) of the powder bed (14) is captured and compared to the set of training data. Deviations from the nominal model of the first powder bed (14) are determined. Any deviations that are greater than a numerical threshold are labelled and identified as a defect which includes its type and severity.

<claims>
1. A method of monitoring an additive manufacturing build process of a workpiece (20) using an additive manufacturing system (10) comprising a first powder bed (14) and a recoater (22) configured to coat the first powder bed (14) with a layer of powder, the method comprising: a first phase comprising: depositing a first layer of powder onto the first powder bed (14) of the additive manufacturing system (10); capturing a topographical profile (36) of a portion of the first powder bed (14) with a profilometer (24, 24'); capturing an image (38) of the first powder bed (14) with a camera (26); combining the image (38) and the topographical profile (36) to create a first data set (40); transferring the first data set (40) to a machine learning model (34); and generating, with the machine learning model (34), a set of training data based on the first data set (40); and a second phase comprising: depositing a second layer of power onto a second powder bed (14) with the additive manufacturing system (10); capturing an image (38) of the second powder bed (14) with the camera (26); comparing the image (38) of the second powder bed (14) to the set of training data; determining a set of deviations from a nominal model of the first powder bed (14) based on comparison of the image (38) of the second powder bed (14) to the set of training data; labelling a deviation from the set of deviations that is greater than a numerical threshold; and identifying the deviation that is greater than the numerical threshold as a defect.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein capturing the topographical profile (36) of the portion of the powder bed (14) with the profilometer (24, 24') comprises: scanning, with the profilometer (24, 24'), a topography of a portion of the first layer of the powder bed (14); and creating a topographical profile (36) of the portion of the first layer, the topographical profile (36) comprising data points corresponding to the topography of the portion of the first layer of the powder bed (14).
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the training data comprises: a nominal model of the powder bed (14); and a set of deviations from the nominal model of the powder bed (14).
4. The method of any preceding claim, further comprising:
screening any deviations that are less than or equal to the numerical threshold out of the set of deviations.
5. The method of any preceding claim, further comprising: determining a severity of the defect based on a degree of deviation from nominal and a size of the defect; and assigning a severity classification to the defect based on the determined severity of the defect.
6. A method of monitoring an additive manufacturing process, the method comprising: scanning a topography of a layer of a powder bed (14) with a profilometer (24, 24') that is operatively coupled to an additive manufacturing machine; measuring deviations from a nominal model of the layer of the powder bed (14) to determine relative height data between the scanned layer of the powder bed (14) and the nominal model; outputting the relative height data into a machine learning algorithm; training the machine learning algorithm; capturing images of the powder bed (14) to create a set of camera data (38); monitoring the powder bed (14) by using the set of camera data (38); identifying a deviation in the set of camera data (38) based on the machine learning algorithm; and determining an acceptability of the deviation.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein deciding an acceptability of the deviation comprises comparing a value of the deviation to a pre-set numerical threshold.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising: screening out the deviation if the value of the deviation is less than or equal to the pre-set numerical threshold; or adding the deviation to a data set (40) if the value of the deviation is greater than the pre-set numerical threshold.
9. The method of claim 8, further comprising: labelling the data set (40) to indicate a presence of a defect; and assigning a severity classification to the defect based on a degree of deviation from nominal and a size of the defect.
10. The method of any of claims 6 to 9, wherein measuring deviations from a nominal model of the layer of the powder bed (14) comprises comparing a measured height of the layer of the powder bed (14) to a height of the nominal model.
