MEDICAMENT DISPENSING DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
The invention provides for a metered dose delivery device adapted to dispense a metered dose of a medicament, wherein the metering of the dose is controlled based on a user input and user specific data. The device includes a user interface adapted to receive a user input. The device further includes a communication interface adapted to communicate with a processing unit and adapted to transmit user specific data to, and receive user specific data from, the processing unit. The transmitted and received user specific data includes the user input. The device further includes a control unit adapted to control the metering of the dose of the medicament based on the user input and the received user specific data.

<claims>
1. A metered dose delivery device adapted to dispense a metered dose of a medicament, the device comprising: a user interface, wherein the user interface is adapted to receive a user input; a communication interface adapted to communicate with a processing unit, wherein the communication interface is adapted to: transmit user specific data to the processing unit, wherein the user specific data comprises the user input; receive user specific data from the processing unit; and a control unit, wherein the control unit is adapted to control the metering of the dose of the medicament based on the user input and the received user specific data.
2. A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processing unit is a remote processing unit.
3. A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processing unit is adapted to analyse the transmitted user specific data, thereby generating analysis data and wherein the received user specific data comprises the analysis data.
4. A device as claimed in claim 3, wherein the processing unit is adapted to perform the analysis by way of a machine learning algorithm.
5. A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the user specific data comprises a user profile.
6. A device as claimed in claim 6, wherein the user profile comprises historic user information.
7. A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the user input comprises user feedback.
8. A device as claimed in claim 7, wherein the user feedback comprises a perceived efficacy of the dispensed metered dose of the medicament.
9. A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the user interface comprises a user identification unit.
10. A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the user interface is further adapted to provide a prompt signal to the user.
11. A device as claimed in claim 10, wherein the prompt signal comprises: a visual signal; an audible signal; a tactile signal; and an electronic signal.
12. A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the device comprises a medicament identification unit adapted to identify the medicament and wherein the user specific information comprises the identity of the medicament.
13. A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the medicament comprises a mixture of a plurality of preliminary medicaments.
14. A device as claimed in claim 13, wherein a composition of the mixture is based on the received user specific data.
15. A method for dispensing a metered dose of a medicament, the method comprising: receiving a user input; transmitting user specific data to a processing unit; receiving user specific data from the processing unit; controlling the metering of the dose of medicament based on the user input and the received user specific data; and dispensing the metered dose of medicament.
