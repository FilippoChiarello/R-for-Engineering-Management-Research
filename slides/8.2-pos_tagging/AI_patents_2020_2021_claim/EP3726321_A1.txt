<title>
A METHOD TO COLLECT LABELS FOR SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS USING NATURAL LANGUAGE AND DEBUG / ONLINE MODE OF PLC ENGINEERING SOFTWARE
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a computer-implemented method of annotating monitoring data and a corresponding engineering tool. Historical data of an industrial system collected in an online / debug mode of the engineering tool is annotated in natural language by a domain-expert in the online / debug mode of the engineering tool.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. Computer-implemented method of annotating monitoring data, comprising the steps: - collecting (1) values of at least one physical quantity of an industrial system (30) describing a current state of the industrial system (30) as historical data in a debug / online mode of an engineering tool (20); - annotating (3) the historical data by a domain-expert producing annotated data, wherein labels in natural language are provided as meta-data to the historical data in the debug / online mode of the engineering tool (20).
2. Computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the steps are executed during an engineering phase of the industrial system (30).
3. Computer-implemented method according to any preceding claim, wherein the steps are alternatively or additionally executed during operation of the industrial system (30).
4. Computer-implemented method according to any preceding claim, wherein the values of the at least one physical quantity are collected from a simulation model of the industrial system (30).
5. Computer-implemented method according to any preceding claim, further comprising the step: - defining (2) portions of interest of the historical data to be annotated in the debug / online mode of the engineering tool (20)
after the step of collecting (1), wherein in the step of annotating (3) only the portions of interest are labelled by the domain-expert.
6. Computer-implemented method according to any preceding claim, further comprising the step: - sending (4) the annotated data to an Internet of Things, IoT, platform (40) or a cloud system for storage.
7. Computer-implemented method according to claim 6, further comprising the step: - uploading (5) the annotated data to a configured customer tenant (41) of the IoT platform (40).
8. Computer-implemented method according to claim 6 or 7, further comprising the step: - uploading (6) anonymized annotated data to a data lake (42) of the IoT platform (40).
9. Computer-implemented method according to any of claims 6 to 8, wherein the IoT platform (40) is an Industrial Internet of Things, IIoT, platform.
10. Engineering tool (20) arranged and configured to implement the steps of the computer-implemented method according to any of claims 1 to 5, comprising: - a data collecting feature (21) arranged and configured to implement the step of collecting (1) historical data; and - an annotating feature (22) arranged and configured to implement the step of annotating (3) and optionally to implement the step of defining (2) portions of interest or the collected historical data.
11. Engineering tool (20) according to claim 10 arranged and configured to implement the steps of the computer-implemented method according to any of claims 6 to 9, further comprising: - a communication feature (23) arranged and configured to implement at least one of the steps of sending (4), uploading (5) to a customer tenant (41) and uploading (6) data to a data lake (42).
12. Engineering tool according to claim 10 or 11, wherein the engineering tool (20) is an engineering tool for programmable logic controllers, PLC.
13. Data carrier (50) arranged and configured to store the engineering tool (20) according to any of claims 10 to 12.
14. Computer system (60) arranged and configured to execute the steps of the computer-implemented method according to claims 1 to 9.
