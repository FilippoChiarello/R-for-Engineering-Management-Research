PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEMS WITH LOCALIZATION-BASED INTENT DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and techniques for a physical access control systems with localization-based intent detection are described herein. In an example, an access control system may regulate access to an asset. The access control system is adapted to establish a first connection with a key-device. The access control system may be further adapted to receive a credential for a user over the first connection. The access control system may be further adapted to establish a second connection with the key-device. The access control system may be further adapted to determine an intent of the user to access the asset. The access control system may use location data derived from the second connection to determine the intent of the user. The access control system may be further adapted to provide the credential to an access controller, based on identifying an intent of the user to access the asset.

<claims>
1. A method of regulating access to an asset, comprising: establishing a first connection with a key-device; receiving a credential for a user over the first connection; establishing a second connection with the key-device; and providing the credential to an access controller.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first connection is Bluetooth Low Energy and the second connection is Ultra-Wideband.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the asset is a physical location.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the asset is an electronic device.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising maintaining a location of the key-device using the second connection.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising authenticating the credential for the user associated with the credential to access the asset.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the key-device is a physical card with an integrated circuit.
8. The method of claim 6, wherein the key-device is a mobile device.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein providing the credential to the access controller is based on determining the user intends to access the asset.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein determining the user intends to access the asset, further comprising: determining a set of location points of the key-device using the second connection; calculating a probability the user will access the asset using the set of location points; and determining the probability exceeds a predetermined threshold.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein establishing the second connection with key-device occurs based on an interaction with the key-device using the first connection.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the access controller includes a physical access control system controller.
13. The method of claim 1, further comprising storing the credential in cache memory.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein providing the credential to the access controller further comprises transferring the credential from the cache memory.
15. The method of claim 13, further comprising removing the credential from the cache memory.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein removing the credential from the cache memory is based on receiving an indication the user is not permitted to access the asset.
17. The method of claim 15, wherein removing the credential from the cache memory is based on losing the second connection with the key-device.
18. The method of claim 15, wherein removing the credential from the cache memory is based on an elapsing of a predetermined time.
19. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving a validation indication from the access controller; and permitting access to the asset.
20. A method of regulating access to an asset using a key-device, comprising: upon the key-device entering a first connection range, establishing a first connection between the key-device and a reader; providing, from the key-device, a credential associated with a user to the reader using the first connection; in response to the key-device entering a second connection range, establishing a second connection between the key-device and the reader; providing, from the reader, the credential to an authorization service; receiving, at the reader, validation of the credential from the authorization service; and transmitting, from the reader, a command, to an access controller, to grant access to the asset.
21. The method of claim 20, wherein the first connection is Bluetooth Low Energy and the second connection is Ultra-Wideband.
22. The method of claim 20, wherein transmitting the command to the access controller is based on determining the user intends to access the asset.
23. The method of claim 22, wherein determining the user intends to access the asset, further comprising: determining, at the reader, a set of location points of the key-device using the second connection; calculating a probability the user will access the asset using the set of location points; and determining the probability exceeds a predetermined threshold.
24. The method of claim 22, wherein determining the user intends to access the asset is based in part on sensor data collected from a sensor of the key-device.
25. The method of claim 20, wherein the asset is a physical location.
