(d) storing the likelihood of the female patient having endometriosis;
(e) automatically generating a message containing the likelihood of the female patient having endometriosis by the content server whenever the updated information has been stored; and
(f) transmitting the message to all of the users over the computer network in real time, so that each user has immediate access to the likelihood of the female patient having endometriosis.
129. The method of claim 128, wherein the machine learning algorithm is trained on a group of miRNA features selected from the group consisting of:
(i) miR-342, miR-451a, and miR-3613;
(ii) miR-342, miR-451a, miR-3613, and miR-125b;
(iii) miR-342, miR-451a, miR-3613, miR-125b, and let- 7b;
(iv) miR-342, miR-451a, let-7b, and miR-125b;
(v) miR-342, miR-451a, let-7b, and miR-3613; (vi) miR-342, miR-451a, and let-7b;
(vii) miR-125b, miR-150, miR-342, miR-451a, and let- 7b; and
(viii) miR-125b, miR-150, miR-342, miR-3613, miR-451a, and let-7b.
130. The method of claim 128 or 129, further comprising obtaining a sample comprising
miRNA from the subj ect.
131. The method of claim 130, wherein the sample is a blood sample, plasma sample, or erum sample.
132. The method of claim 130, wherein the sample is a saliva sample.
133. The method of claim 130, wherein the sample is a serum sample.
134. The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the machine learning algorithm is a random forest algorithm, k-nearest-neighbors algorithm (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), or Naive Bayes.
135. The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the method has an AUC for detecting endometriosis of greater than 0.85 in a population of women.
136. The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the population of women
includes women having received hormone therapy within 3 months of the date on which the sample was obtained.
137. The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the hormone therapy includes birth control pills or GnRH agonists.
138. The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the sample is a cell-free serum sample.
139. The method of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the sample is a cell-free saliva sample.
140. The method of any one of the preceding claims, further comprising administering a
treatment to the subject to treat the endometriosis based on the likelihood reported in (e).
141. The method of claim 140, wherein the treatment comprises a hormonal treatment, a statin, or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
142. The method of claim 140, wherein the hormonal treatment comprises an oral
contraceptive, a progestin, a GnRH agonist, a GnRH antagonist, an androgen, an
antiprogesterone, a SERM, or SPRM.
143. The method of claim 140, wherein the statin comprises atorvastatin, cerivastatin,
fluvastatin, lovastatin, mevastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin.
144. The method of claim 140, wherein the NSAID comprises paracetamol, a COX-2
inhibitor, or aspirin.
