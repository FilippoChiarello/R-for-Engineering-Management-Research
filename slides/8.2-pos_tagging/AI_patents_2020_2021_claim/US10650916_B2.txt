<title>
Method for providing therapy to an individual
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for providing therapy to an individual, the method comprising: transmitting a log of use dataset associated with communication behavior of the individual during a time period; receiving a supplementary dataset characterizing mobility of the individual in association with the time period; generating a survey dataset upon retrieving responses provided by the individual to at least one of a set of surveys, associated with a set of time points of the time period; generating a predictive model from a passive dataset derived from the log of use dataset and the supplementary dataset and the survey dataset; generating a report summarizing a mental health state of the individual, associated with at least a portion of the time period, from the passive dataset, the survey dataset, and an output of the predictive model; and rendering information from the report to a coach associated with the individual.
</abstract>

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for monitoring a mental health state associated with an individual, the method comprising: receiving, at a computing system, a dataset associated with a mobile computing device of the individual; at the computing system: automatically generating a report summarizing the mental health state, wherein the report is generated based on the dataset; transmitting the report to a computing device of a coach; enabling a communicable link with the computing device of the coach; in response to enabling the communicable link, providing a therapy to the individual through a mobile application of the mobile computing device; determining a value of an engagement metric based on a communication between the individual and the coach via the communicable link during a first time period; determining a second value of the engagement metric based on a second communication between the individual and the coach via the communicable link during a second time period later than the first time period; determining that the second value is below a threshold; and receiving, at the mobile computing device, a notification from the coach.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the dataset comprises a log of use dataset.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the first value is further determined based on the log of use dataset.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising in response to determining that the second value is below a threshold, automatically prompting the coach to establish a third communication with the individual, wherein the third communication comprises the notification.
5. The method of claim 4, further comprising guiding the coach to escalate care of the individual to a higher level of care beyond the coach.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the notification comprises a recommendation to the individual to reach out to the higher level of care.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving a second dataset associated with the mobile computing device of the individual; automatically generating a second report summarizing the mental health state, wherein the second report is generated based on the second dataset; and transmitting the second report to the computing device of the coach.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the second value is further determined based on the second report.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the threshold is determined, at least in part by the first value.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising, at an application executing on the mobile device, receiving a set of responses provided by the individual to a set of one or more surveys, wherein the report is further determined based on the set of responses.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the notification comprises a prompt to provide a second set of responses to a second set of one or more surveys.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the engagement metric comprises at least one of: a number of messages exchanged between the individual and the coach and a number of phone calls between the individual and the coach.
13. A method for monitoring a mental health state associated with an individual, the method comprising: receiving, at a computing system, a dataset associated with a mobile computing device of the individual; at the computing system: automatically generating a report summarizing the mental health state, wherein the report is generated based on the dataset; transmitting the report to a computing device of a coach; enabling a communicable link with the computing device of the coach; in response to enabling the communicable link, providing a therapy to the individual through a mobile application of the mobile computing device; determining a value of an engagement metric based on a first communication between the individual and the coach via the communicable link during a first time period; determining that the value is below a threshold; and automatically prompting the coach to establish a second communication with the individual via the communicable link.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the dataset comprises a log of use dataset associated with the individual's use of the mobile computing device.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the dataset further comprises a supplementary dataset.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the supplementary dataset comprises mobility data, wherein the mobility data is derived from a set of one or more sensors of the mobile computing device.
17. The method of claim 13, further comprises, in response to the second communication, enabling, at the computing system, a second communicable link with a higher level of care beyond the coach.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the higher level of care comprises a therapist.
19. The method of claim 13, further comprising determining an efficacy of the therapy based at least in part on the value of the engagement metric.
