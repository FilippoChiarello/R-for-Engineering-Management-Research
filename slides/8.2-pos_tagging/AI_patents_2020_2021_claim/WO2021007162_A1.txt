A SECURE COMPUTING HARDWARE APPARATUS AND METHODS OF MANUFACTURING A SECURE COMPUTING HARDWARE APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
A method of manufacturing a secure computing hardware apparatus includes receiving at least a secret generator, wherein the secret generator is configured to generate a module-specific secret, receiving a device identifier, wherein the device identifier is configured to produce at least an output comprising a secure proof of the module-specific secret, and communicatively connecting the device identifier to the secret generator.

<claims>
1. A method of manufacturing a secure computing hardware apparatus, the method comprising: receiving at least a secret generator, wherein the secret generator is configured to generate a module-specific secret;
receiving a device identifier, wherein the device identifier is configured to produce at least an output comprising a secure proof of the module-specific secret; and
communicatively connecting the device identifier to the secret generator.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein receiving the at least a secret generator further comprises fabricating the secret generator.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein fabrication of the at least a secret generator further includes fabrication of at least a non-analyzable circuit element.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein fabrication of at least a non-analyzable circuit element
further comprises fabrication of a circuit element denatured by probing.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein fabrication of at least a non-analyzable circuit element
includes fabrication of at least a circuit element having an output unpredictable by circuit analysis.
6. The method of claim 3, wherein fabrication of at least a non-analyzable circuit element
further comprises fabrication of an element that performs a physically unclonable function.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the physically unclonable function further comprises a
quantum confinement physically unclonable function.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the secret generator is further configured to output a
plurality of bits as a function of the module-specific secret.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least a secret generator further comprises at least a first secret generator having at least a first secret share of the module-specific secret and at least a second secret generator having a second secret share of the module-specific secret.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the device identifier is further configured to perform the secure proof using a challenge-response protocol.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the device identifier is further configured to perform the secure proof using a digital signature.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the device identifier is further configured to perform the secure proof using a direct anonymous authentication protocol.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the device identifier is further configured to perform the secure proof by performing a secure multiparty computation using a first set of inputs from the at least a secret generator and a second set of inputs from at least an exterior input.
14. The method of claim 1 further comprising:
receiving a key extractor configured to extract a private key from the module-specific secret module; and
communicatively connecting the key extractor to the secret generator and the device
identifier.
15. The method of claim 1 further comprising:
receiving a verification information circuit, the verification information circuit configured to generate verification information to evaluate the secure proof; and
communicatively connecting the verification information circuit to the secret generator.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein:
the secure proof is a digital signature protocol using a private key derived from the modulespecific secret; and
the verification circuit is further configured to generate a public key associated with a private key.
17. The method of claim 1, further comprising communicatively connecting a memory to the device identifier.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the device identifier is further configured to encrypt data written to the memory using a private key.
19. The method of claim 17, wherein the memory includes at least a portion connected only to the secure computing hardware apparatus.
20. The method of claim 1 further comprising:
receiving a processor; and
communicatively connecting the processor to the proof-generation circuit.
21. A method of manufacturing a secure computing hardware apparatus, the method comprising: receiving at least a secret generator, wherein the secret generator is configured to generate a module-specific secret;
receiving a device identifier, wherein the device identifier is configured to produce at least an output comprising a secure proof of the module-specific secret; and communicatively connecting the device identifier to the secret generator, wherein communicatively connecting the device identifier to the at least a secret generator further comprises:
manufacturing a state machine having at least an input and at least an output, wherein the state machine is in a first state representing a non-provisioned circuit wherein the at least an input does not connect to the at least an output;
connecting the at least an input to the at least a secret generator device;
connecting the at least an output to the device identifier; and
converting the state machine to a second state representing a provisioned circuit, wherein the at least an input is connected to the at least an output.
