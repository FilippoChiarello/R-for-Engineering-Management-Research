<title>
Treatment for Bacterial Infections
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and compositions are provided for the reduction in virulence of a bacterium by interfering with the biosynthesis of yersiniabactin using salicylic acid or an analog thereof. Also provided are methods of treating a bacterial infection in a subject in need thereof.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method of treating a bacterial infection in a subject in need thereof, the method comprising administering to the subject a composition comprising an analog of salicylic acid.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the analog of salicylic acid has a structure of formula (I): wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 are independently hydrogen, halo, thio, hydroxy, or substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl, and wherein the substituents of R1, R2, R3, and R4 can form a fused ring and at least one of R1, R2, R3, and R4 is not hydrogen.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 are independently hydrogen, fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, thio, hydroxy, or C1-C10 alkyl.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein the analog of salicylic acid comprises at least one compound selected from the group consisting of 3-methylsalicylic acid, 3-chlorosalicylic acid, 3-fluorosalicylic acid, 4-methylsalicylic acid, 4-chlorosalicylic acid, 4-fluorosalicylic acid, 5-methylsalicylic acid, 5-flourosalicylic acid, 5-chlorosalicyclic acid, 6-methylsalicylic acid, 6-fluorosalicyclic acid, thiosalicylic acid, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 5-iodosalicylic acid, 5-bromosalicylic acid, 3,5-dichlorosalicylic acid, 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, 2-hydroxy-1-naphthoic acid, 2-hydroxy-6-methylbenzoic acid, 3,4,5,6-tetrafluorosalicylic acid and any combination thereof.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the analog of salicylic acid comprises 5-methylsalicylic acid, 6-methyl salicylic acid, 4-fluoro salicylic acid, or 6-fluoro-salicylic acid.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein the analog of salicylic acid comprises 5-methylsalicylic acid.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein the subject is a mammal.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein the subject is a human.
9. The method of claim 1 wherein bacterial infection is a urinary tract infection.
10. The method of claim 1 wherein bacterial infection is caused by E coli.
11. The method of claim 1 further comprising administering an antibiotic to the subject.
12. The method of claim 1 wherein the antibiotic is co-administered with the analog of salicylic acid to the subject.
13. The method of claim 11 wherein the antibiotic comprises a trimethoprim.
14. A method of: measuring the virulence of a bacteria in a subject infected with the bacteria, the method comprising detecting the presence of native yersiniabactin in a biological sample obtained from the subject, analyzing the sample for native yersiniabactin, and quantifying the virulence by the amount of native yersiniabactin in the sample; or screening a compound for antibacterial and/or anti-virulence activity, the method comprising contacting a bacterium with the compound and measuring the concentration of versiniabactin and/or modified versiniabactin produced in the bacterium; or interfering with the biosynthesis of versiniabactin in a bacterium, the method comprising exposing the bacterium to an analog of salicylic acid, such that the compound migrates to the intracellular space of the bacterium and interferes with versiniabactin synthesis.
15. 15-41. (canceled)
42. A composition comprising an analog of salicylic acid and an antibiotic.
43. The composition of claim 42 wherein the analog of salicylic acid has a structure of formula (I): wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 are independently hydrogen, halo, thio, hydroxy, or substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl, and wherein the substituents of R1, R2, R3, and R4 can form a fused ring and at least one of R1, R2, R3, and R4 is not hydrogen.
44. The composition of claim 43 wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 are independently hydrogen, fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, thio, hydroxy, or C1-C10 alkyl.
45. The composition of claim 42 wherein the analog of salicylic acid comprises at least one compound selected from the group consisting of 3-methylsalicylic acid, 3-chlorosalicylic acid, 3-fluorosalicylic acid, 4-methylsalicylic acid, 4-chlorosalicylic acid, 4-fluorosalicylic acid, 5-methylsalicylic acid, 5-flourosalicylic acid, 5-chlorosalicyclic acid, 6-methylsalicylic acid, 6-fluorosalicyclic acid, thiosalicylic acid, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 5-iodosalicylic acid, 5-bromosalicylic acid, 3,5-dichlorosalicylic acid, 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, 2-hydroxy-1-naphthoic acid, 2-hydroxy-6-methylbenzoic acid, 3,4,5,6-tetrafluorosalicylic acid and any combination thereof.
46. (canceled)
47. The composition of claim 42 wherein the analog of salicylic acid comprises 5-methyl salicylic acid.
48. The composition of claim 42 wherein the antibiotic comprises a trimethoprim.
49. (canceled)
