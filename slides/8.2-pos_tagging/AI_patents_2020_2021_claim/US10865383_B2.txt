Methods and formulations for orthopedic cell therapy
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the present invention include methods and compositions related to the production and use of clonal lineages of embryonic progenitor cell lines derived from differentiating cultures of primordial stem cells, in particular, said methods and compositions relate to methods of differentiating cells in the presence of members of the BMP family of growth factors and the applications of said cell lines in the treatment of degenerative orthopedic diseases such as osteoarthritis.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method of increasing expression of COL2A1 and minimizing expression of COL10A1 in a clonal embryonic progenitor cell line that does not display SSEA4, TRA1-60 or TRA1-81 sero-positivity and is capable of further differentiating into more than one cell type, wherein the method comprises differentiating said clonal embryonic progenitor cell line in the presence of GDF5 or BMP6, and in the presence of TGFβ, thereby increasing the expression of COL2A1 and minimizing the expression of COL10A1 by the embryonic progenitor cell line.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the TGFβ is TGFβ3.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the GDF5 is present at a concentration between about 10-1,000 ng/mL.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the TGFβ3 is present at a concentration between about 1-100 ng/mL.
5. A method of conditioning a clonal embryonic progenitor cell line that does not display SSEA4, TRA1-60 or TRA1-81 sero-positivity and is capable of further differentiating into more than one cell type, the method comprising culturing said clonal embryonic progenitor cell line in the presence of one or more BMP factors selected from TGF 3, GDF5, BMP2, BMP4, BMP6 and BMP7 to induce or increase expression of COL2A1, COL10A1, CRTAC1, tenomodulin, sialoprotein II, COL9A2, or CHAD by said clonal embryonic progenitor cell line.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein said GDF5 is present at a concentration between about 10-1,000 ng/mL.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein said TGFβ3 is present at a concentration between about 1-100 ng/mL.
8. The method of claim 5, wherein said clonal embryonic progenitor cell line is EN7, 7PEND24, SM30, E15, 4D20.8, 7SMOO32, MEL2 or SK11.
9. The method of claim 6, wherein said TGFβ3 is present at a concentration between about 1-100 ng/mL.
10. The method of claim 5, wherein said clonal embryonic progenitor cell line is cultured in the presence of one or more BMP factors comprising: (a) TGFβ3, (b) GDF5, (c) BMP4, (d) BMP6, (e) BMP7, (f) TGFβ3 and BMP4, (g) TGFβ3 and BMP6, (h) TGFβ3 and BMP7, (i) TGFβ3 and GDF5, (j) BMP2, BMP4 and TGFβ3, (k) BMP2 and BMP7, (1) BMP2, BMP7 and TGFβ3, or (m) BMP4, BMP7 and TGFβ3.
11. The method of claim 5, wherein said clonal embryonic progenitor cell line is cultured in the presence of one or more BMP factors comprising BMP2 and TGFβ3, or BMP4 and TGFβ3.
12. The method of claim 5, wherein expression of COL2A1 is induced or increased when said clonal embryonic progenitor cell line is cultured in the presence of one or more BMP factors comprising: (a) TGFβ3, (b) GDF5, (c) BMP4, (d) BMP6, (e) BMP7, (f) TGFβ3 and BMP4, (g) TGFβ3 and BMP6, (h) TGFβ3 and BMP7, (i) TGFβ3 and GDF5, (j) BMP2, BMP4 and TGFβ3, (k) BMP2 and BMP7, (1) BMP2, BMP7 and TGFβ3, (m) BMP4, BMP7 and TGFβ3, or (n) TGFβ3 and BMP2.
13. The method of claim 5, wherein expression of CRTAC1 is induced or increased when said clonal embryonic progenitor cell line is cultured in the presence of one or more BMP factors comprising: (a) TGFβ3, (b) GDF5, (c) BMP4, (d) BMP6, (e) BMP7, (f) TGFβ3 and BMP4, (g) TGFβ3 and BMP6, (h) TGFβ3 and BMP7, (i) TGFβ3 and GDF5, (j) BMP2 and BMP4, (k) BMP2, BMP4 and TGFβ3, (1) BMP2 and BMP7, (m) BMP2, BMP7 and TGFβ3, (n) BMP4 and BMP7, or (o) BMP4, BMP7 and TGFβ3.
14. The method of claim 5, wherein expression of tenomodulin is induced or increased when said clonal embryonic progenitor cell line is cultured in the presence of one or more BMP factors comprising BMP4 or BMP7.
15. The method of claim 5, wherein expression of sialoprotein II is induced or increased when said clonal embryonic progenitor cell line is cultured in the presence of one or more BMP factors comprising: (a) BMP2 and TGFβ3, (b) BMP4 and TGFβ3, or (c) TGFβ3.
16. The method of claim 5, wherein expression of COL10A1 is induced or increased when said clonal embryonic progenitor cell line is cultured in the presence of one or more BMP factors comprising: (a) TGFβ3 and BMP4, (b) TGFβ3 and BMP6, (c) TGFβ3 and BMP7, (d) BMP2, BMP4 and TGFβ3, (e) BMP2 and BMP7, (f) BMP2, BMP7 and TGFβ3, or (g) BMP4, BMP7 and TGFβ3.
17. The method of claim 5, wherein said clonal embryonic progenitor cell line is cultured in the presence of one or more BMP factors comprising: (a) TGFβ3, (b) BMP4 and TGFβ3, (c) GDF5 and TGFβ3, or (d) BMP7 and TGFβ3.
18. The method of claim 1, wherein the BMP6 is present at a concentration of about 30 ng/mL.
19. The method of claim 1, wherein expression of CRTAC1 is also increased.
20. The method of claim 1, wherein the clonal embryonic progenitor cell line is 4D20.8.
