<title>
Method and system using machine learning techniques for checking data integrity in a data warehouse feed
</title>

<abstract>
This disclosure provides a method and system to perform data integrity checks in a data warehouse (DWH) feed using machine-learning (ML) processes. According to an exemplary method, a ML integrity check is performed on received data which has been extracted from a plurality of source files, and after ML processes validate the extracted data, the validated data is transformed and loaded to a DWH.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method associate with an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) system for performing automated data quality checks on an associated data warehouse (DWH) feed operatively associated with the ETL system, the ETL system including a processor in communication with a memory configured to perform the method comprising: extracting, with an extraction module operatively associated with the ETL system, data from a plurality of source databases and source files associated with the DWH feed; automatically validating, with a machine-learning integrity check module operatively associated with the ETL system configured to execute a machine-learning algorithm associated with a 2-class data classifier, the extracted data by classifying and assigning an integrity status including one of sound and suspicious thereto; transmitting data with a status of sound to a transformation module operatively associated with the ETL system; transmitting data with a status of suspicious to a quarantine module operatively associated with the ETL system; transforming, with the transformation module, the validated data classified and assigned as sound into at least one temporary table; and loading, with a loading module operatively associated with the ETL system, transformed data into a data warehouse feed system associated with the DWH feed for storage; wherein the ETL system transmits data classified as suspicious from the quarantine module to a human expert verification and correction module, the human expert verification and correction module determining if the suspicious data is one of valid and corrupt, and if the suspicious data is determined to be valid manually reclassifying the suspicious data as sound and including the suspicious data in a training set database operatively associated with training the 2-class classifier to further train the 2-class classifier to classify the manually reclassified suspicious data as sound, and if the suspicious data is determined to be corrupt, correcting the suspicious data.
2. The method of claim 1, further including: identify, with the human expert verification and correction module, data with a status of suspicious that has incorrect values; correct, with the human expert verification and correction module, the value of the identified data; and change, with the human expert verification and correction module, the status of the changed data from suspicious to sound.
3. The method of claim 2, further including: transmitting, with the correction module, data with a status of sound to the training set database when the data is loaded into the data warehouse feed system.
4. The method of claim 1, further including at least one of: with the extraction module, gathering the extracted data from the plurality of source databases and source files into a uniform format; with the transformation module, aggregating the checked data into a plurality of tables; and with the loading module, loading the plurality of tables into the data warehouse feed system.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the machine-learning algorithm is a Matrix Factorization Method.
6. A computer program product comprising a non-transitory recording medium storing instructions for performing the method of claim 1, and a processor in communication with the non-transitory recording medium that implements the instructions.
7. An Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) system for performing automated data quality checks on an associated data warehouse (DWH) feed operatively associated with the ETL system, the ETL system comprising: an extraction module operatively associated with the ETL system programmed to extract data from a plurality of source databases and source files associated with the DWH feed; a machine-learning integrity check module operatively associated with the ETL system configured to execute a machine learning algorithm associated with a 2-class data classifier and programmed to automatically validate the extracted data by classifying and assigning an integrity status including one of sound and suspicious thereto, and the ETL system configured to transmit data with a status of sound to a transformation module operatively associated with the ETL system and transmit data with a status of suspicious to a quarantine module operatively associated with the ETL system; a transformation module operatively associated with the ETL system programmed to transform the validated data classified and assigned sound into at least one temporary table; a loading module operatively associated with the ETL system programmed to load the transformed data into a data warehouse feed system associated with the DWH feed for storage; and a display operatively associated with the ETL system and DWH feed system configured to display the stored data, wherein the ETL system is configured to transmits data classified as suspicious from the quarantine module to a human expert verification and correction module, the human expert verification and correction module configured to determine if the suspicious data is one of valid and corrupt, and if the suspicious data is determined to be valid manually reclassifying the suspicious data as sound and including the suspicious data in a training set database operatively associated with training the 2-class classifier to further train the 2-class classifier to classify the manually reclassified suspicious data as sound, and if the suspicious data is determined to be corrupt, correcting the suspicious data.
8. The system of claim 7, wherein the human expert verification and correction module is further programmed to: identify data with a status of suspicious that has incorrect values; correct the value of the identified data; and change the status of the changed data from suspicious to sound.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the human expert verification and correction module is further programmed to: transmit data with a status of sound to the training set database when the data is loaded into the data warehouse feed system.
10. The system of claim 7, wherein at least one of: the extraction module is further programmed to gather the extracted data from the plurality of source databases and source files into a uniform format; the transformation module is further programmed to aggregate the checked data into a plurality of tables; and the loading module is further programmed to load the plurality of tables into the data warehouse feed system.
