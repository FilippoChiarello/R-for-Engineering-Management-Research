SSB Pattern and DMRS Design for PBCH IN 5G NR
</title>

<abstract>
Devices, systems and methods for a fifth generation (5G) or new radio (NR) system comprising multiplexing, by a gNodeB (gNB), a physical broadcast channel (PBCH) and an associated demodulation reference signal (DMRS) in a time division multiplexing (TDM) manner; and transmitting, by the gNB, the PBCH by employing a Discrete Fourier Transform-spread-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) waveform and its associated DMRS.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: multiplexing, by a gNodeB (gNB), a physical broadcast channel (PBCH) and an associated demodulation reference signal (DMRS) in a time division multiplexing (TDM) manner; and transmitting, by the gNB, the PBCH by employing a Discrete Fourier Transform-spread-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) waveform and its associated DMRS.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the PBCH spans K1 symbol(s) and the associated DMRS spans K2 symbols(s), wherein K1 and K2 are constant.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the PBCH and the associated DMRS occupy N1 PRBs and a primary synchronization signal (PSS) and a secondary synchronization signal (SSS) occupy N2 PRBs, where N1 and N2 are constant.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein a synchronization signal block (SSB) is not multiplexed with other DL signals/channels in a frequency division multiplexing (FDM) manner.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein a channel for the PBCH is referred from the SSS, wherein a same frequency resource is allocated for the transmission of the SSS and the PBCH, wherein the SSS is used to carry both SSB time index and partial cell ID information.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the DMRS and the SSS are allocated in a same symbol and multiplexed in a time division multiplexing (TDM) manner prior to DFT operation, wherein the DMRS is used to carry an SSB time index and the SSS is used to carry partial cell ID information.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein a Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence is used for the DMRS sequence generation.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein a root index and/or a cyclic shift of the ZC sequence for DMRS sequence generation is defined as a function of one or more the following parameters: a cell ID, a partial or full SSB index, and a half radio frame index.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein a max length sequence (m-sequence) or a Gold code sequence modulated using pi/2-BPSK modulation is used as the DMRS sequence.
10. The method of claim 7, wherein an initialization seed of the M-sequence includes a cell ID, a full SSB index and/or a half radio frame index or a part of the SSB index and/or the half radio frame index.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein a Bjorck Constant Amplitude Zero Auto Correlation (CAZAC) sequence is used as the DMRS sequence.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the DMRS occupies K resource elements (RE) within one physical resource block (PRB), wherein K is a constant.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein, when the DMRS is not fully occupied within one PRB, the remaining REs are unused and power boosting is applied, wherein the relative power between the DMRS and the PBCH is 10 log 10(12/K)dB.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein a sequence of the DMRS for the PBCH is determined by a cell ID and/or an SSB timing index.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein a phase tracking reference signal (PT-RS) is associated with the PBCH before DFT operation.
16. A method of operating a gNB in a fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) system, the method comprising: multiplexing a physical broadcast channel (PBCH) and a secondary synchronization signal (SSS) in a time division multiplexing (TDM) manner; and transmitting, or causing transmission of, the PBCH and the SSS by employing a Discrete Fourier Transform-spread-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) waveform.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the PBCH is on two symbols and the SSS is on one symbol.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the PBCH is on two consecutive symbols and the symbol on which the SSS is carried is immediately before or immediately after the two consecutive symbols that carry the PBCH.
19. The method of claim 16, wherein the SSS and the PBCH occupy a same number of physical resource blocks in frequency domain.
20. The method of claim 16, wherein the SSS is allocated in a same symbol as a DMRS and multiplexed in a TDM manner prior to DFT operation.

24. A base station, comprising: baseband circuitry configured for multiplexing a physical broadcast channel (PBCH) and an associated demodulation reference signal (DMRS) in a time division multiplexing (TDM) manner; and radio front end circuitry configured for transmitting the PBCH by employing a Discrete Fourier Transform-spread-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) waveform and its associated DMRS.
