SYSTEM AND METHODS FOR LEARNING AND TRAINING USING COGNITIVE LINGUISTIC CODING IN A VIRTUAL REALITY ENVIRONMENT
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for providing an immersive environment is described herein. The immersive environment, such as virtual reality or augmented reality, can be used to develop a trainee's ability to make decisions through a language-based comparison process. Cognitive linguistic coding, including brevity coding, can be used by the trainee to develop, reinforce, or enhance alignment and mapping between structured conceptual representations. The immersive environment can simulate or emulate an actual environment in which a task is to be performed.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A system for providing an immersive learning environment, the system comprising: a mark-up editor configured to edit a video or portion thereof with one or more performance measures;
a display device configure to display the video or portion thereof to a trainee; and one or more processors configured to:
acquire a trainee-input brevity code spoken by the trainee in response to one or more actions associated with the video or portion thereof,
convert the trainee-input brevity code from speech to text,
calculate a trainee performance grade by comparing the trainee-input brevity code converted to text format against the one or more performance measures, and output the trainee performance grade.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the display device is an immersive headset.
3. The system of claim 2, further comprising a microphone to perform the acquiring step.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the microphone is a component of the display device.
5. The system of claim 2, wherein the display device provides 360 degrees field of view.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the mark-up editor comprises a mark-up editor box to generate the one or more performance measures.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the mark-up editor is further configured to overlay the one or more performance measures on the video or portion thereof.
8. The system of claim 6, wherein the one or more performance measures comprise a coach-input brevity code.
9. The system of claim 6, wherein the performance measure comprises a quiz-text mark up or a gaze mark-up.
10. The system of claim 1, wherein the calculating step further comprises comparing a time at which the trainee inputs the trainee-input brevity code against a pre-determined time or time range.
11. The system of claim 1, further comprising a voice-to-text converter to convert the trainee-input brevity code spoken by the trainee into the text format.
12. The system of claim 1, further comprising a review device configured to receive the trainee performance grade.
13. The system of claim 1, wherein the spoken trainee-input brevity code is time-stamped.
14. The system of claim 1, wherein the review device is further configured to replay the video or portion thereof with the one or more performance measures overlaid thereon, with a time-stamped and spoken trainee-input brevity code overlaid thereon, or both.
15. The system of claim 1, wherein the one or more processors is further configured to record a gaze or head orientation of the trainee.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the calculating step further comprises comparing the gaze or head orientation to one of the performance measures.
17. A method for providing an immersive learning environment, the system comprising: editing a video or portion thereof with one or more performance measures;
displaying the video or portion thereof to a trainee; and
acquiring a trainee-input brevity code spoken by a trainee in response to one or more actions associated with the video or portion thereof,
converting the trainee-input brevity code from speech to text,
calculating a trainee performance grade by comparing the trainee-input brevity code converted to text format against the one or more performance measures, and
outputting the trainee performance grade.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein the displaying step is performed by an immersive headset.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the acquiring step is performed by a microphone.
20. The method of claim 17, wherein the microphone is a component of the immersive headset.
21. The method of claim 17, wherein the displaying step is performed within 360 degrees field of view.
22. The method of claim 17, further comprising overlaying the one or more performance measures on the video or portion thereof.
23. The method of claim 22, wherein the one or more performance measures comprise a coach-input brevity code.
24. The method of claim 23, wherein the performance measure comprises a quiz-text mark-up or a gaze mark-up.
25. The method of claim 17, wherein the calculating step further comprises comparing a time at which the trainee inputs the trainee-input brevity code against a pre-determined time or time range.
26. The method of claim 17, wherein the converting step is performed by a voice-to-text converter.
27. The method of claim 17, further comprising time-stamping the trainee-input brevity code at a time of acquisition.
28. The method of claim 17, further comprising replaying the video or portion thereof with the one or more performance measures overlaid thereon, with a time-stamped and spoken trainee-input brevity code overlaid thereon, or both.
29. The method of claim 17, wherein each of the one or more performances measures is overlaid on the video or portion thereof and tagged to a geographical location on the video or portion thereof.
