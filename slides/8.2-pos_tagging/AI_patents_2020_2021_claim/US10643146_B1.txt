<title>
Systems and methods for analyzing resource production
</title>

<abstract>
A method for determining a drill event includes receiving a set of historic drill reports with annotations. The historic drill reports include a plurality of entries including multiple acronyms relating to a single drilling factor. A set of entries of the plurality of entries indicates an associated depth. The method further includes training a report analysis engine utilizing the historic drill reports and annotations; receiving a drill report associated with a well; and determining a drill event and associated depth utilizing the report analysis engine applied to the drill report.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: receiving a set of unstructured historic drill reports, the unstructured historic drill reports including multiple acronyms and/or abbreviations relating to a single drilling factor; transforming the unstructured historic drill reports into structured historic drill reports; based on the structured historic drill reports, building a plurality of field-specific models, each of the plurality of field-specific models being specific to a field having geological, geophysical, petrophysical, lithological, and/or mineralogical characteristics, wherein each of the plurality of field-specific models includes a proximity depletion variable derived from, at least, distances from a well to adjacent wells and associated depletion curves; determining a test set of information from one or more additional historic drill reports, and validating each of the plurality of field-specific models using the test set of information; based on results of the validation, selecting one of the plurality of field-specific models; prescribing, using an analysis engine and based on the selected field-specific model, a drill recipe for the well; drilling a portion of the well in accordance with the drill recipe; receiving an unstructured drill report associated with the well; transforming the unstructured drill report associated with the well into a structured drill report associated with the well; determining, using the analysis engine and based on the selected field-specific model and further based on the structured drill report associated with the well, a drill event for the well and a depth associated with the drill event; prescribing, using the analysis engine and based on the selected field-specific model and further based on the drill event and the depth associated with the drill event, an updated drill recipe for the well; and drilling another portion of the well in accordance with the updated drill recipe.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the drill event includes a mud loss event.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the drill event includes a string event.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the drill event includes a depth specific drill rate.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the drill event includes a deviation in drill parameters from the drill recipe.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the unstructured historic drill reports are in the form of narrated text.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising incorporating the drill event into the selected field-specific model.
8. A method, comprising: receiving a set of unstructured historic drill reports, the unstructured historic drill reports including multiple acronyms and/or abbreviations relating to a single drilling factor; transforming the unstructured historic drill reports into structured historic drill reports; based on the structured historic drill reports, building a plurality of field-specific models, wherein each of the plurality of field-specific models includes a proximity depletion variable derived from, at least, distances from a well to adjacent wells and associated depletion curves; determining a test set of information from one or more additional historic drill reports, and validating each of the plurality of field-specific models using the test set of information; based on results of the validation, selecting one of the plurality of field-specific models; receiving an unstructured drill report associated with the well, a portion of the well being drilled in accordance with a drill recipe; transforming the unstructured drill report associated with the well into a structured drill report associated with the well; determining, using an analysis engine and based on the selected field-specific model and further based on the structured drill report associated with the well, a drill event for the well and a depth associated with the drill event; prescribing, using the analysis engine and based on the selected field-specific model and further based on the drill event and the depth associated with the drill event, an updated drill recipe for the well; and drilling another portion of the well in accordance with the updated drill recipe.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the drill event includes a mud loss event.
10. The method of claim 8, wherein the drill event includes a string event.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein the drill event includes a depth specific drill rate.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the drill event includes a deviation in drill parameters from the drill recipe.
13. The method of claim 8, further comprising incorporating the drill event into the selected field-specific model.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein each of the plurality of field-specific models includes one or more of a regression model, a Markov chain, a time series model, a state space model, a Bayesian model, or a neural network.
15. The method of claim 1, wherein each of the plurality of field-specific models includes one or more machine learning models.
