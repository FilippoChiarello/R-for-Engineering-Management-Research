<abstract>
A device may receive, from a user device, a request for a recommendation identifying one or more tasks to be performed, of a set of tasks that are part of a job for an organization and associated with managing a set of applications for a product or a service. The device may generate the recommendation by using a data model that has been trained using one or more machine learning techniques to process data identifying a set of application status metrics based on application status data for the set of applications, and events data identifying real-time events associated with the group of sites. The device may provide the recommendation for display on an interface of the user device. The device may perform one or more actions associated with assisting in performance of at least one of the one or more tasks.
