SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR INCORPORATING CROSS PLATFORM METRICS FOR INCREASED USER ENGAGEMENT
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, apparatuses, and methods are described for determining a consumer's engagement with a brand of the business by tracking the consumer's activities in multiple platforms, such as social media platforms, content platforms, gaming platforms, other retailers, streaming video providers, service providers, etc. Method are described for probabilistically granting users variations of items that are otherwise being acquired. The granting may be random, but probabilities may be boosted based on the consumer's activities in the platforms.
