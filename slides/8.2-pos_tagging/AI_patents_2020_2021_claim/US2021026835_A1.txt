SYSTEM AND SEMI-SUPERVISED METHODOLOGY FOR PERFORMING MACHINE DRIVEN ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION OF INTEGRITY DUE DILIGENCE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THIRD PARTY ENTITIES AND ASSOCIATED INDIVIDUALS AND STAKEHOLDERS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for performing machine-driven analysis and determination of integrity due diligence risk associated with third-party entities and individuals associated with third-party entities are disclosed.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented system, comprising: a memory for storing and managing data; an user interface that electronically receives user input; and a processor coupled to the memory and the user interface, the processor configured to determine an integrity due diligence risk associated with a third-party entity and further configured to perform the steps: extracting data from a plurality of data sources to form an article corpus; performing a de-duplication of each article from the article corpus based on a similarity index, wherein the de-duplication process is based on one or more of exact title, similar title and similar content; extracting one or more relevant texts from the article corpus by applying weights and a plurality of filters comprising one or more of an organization filter, negative vocabulary filter and a distance algorithm filter; clustering a set of articles corresponding to an event to identify similar articles; performing a classification of sentences to determine sentiment; identifying a risk event, wherein the risk event comprises one or more of: litigation, sanctions, adverse media, background and key individuals; calculating a risk score for each risk event; and based on the risk score, generating, via the user interface, an output wherein the output comprises a graphic that illustrates each risk event and supporting articles with one or more annotations generated via machine learning algorithm that identifies negative content.
2. The computer-implemented system of claim 1, wherein the risk score is associated with a third-party entity.
3. The computer-implemented system of claim 1, wherein the one or more annotations are based on a context-based approach based on a POS Tag of a word.
4. The computer-implemented system of claim 1, wherein the one or more annotations are based on a phrase extraction using metadata.
5. The computer-implemented system of claim 1, wherein the one or more annotations is based on an annotation relevance score that generates vector similarity score between each annotation and one or more dictionary words.
6. The computer-implemented system of claim 1, wherein the generating a risk event further comprises assessing litigation risk by identifying party and party type and performing conclusion analysis based on a pre-trained conclusion identifier model.
7. The computer-implemented system of claim 1, wherein the generating a risk score further comprises determining article-entity relevance, article-section relevance and risk relevance.
8. The computer-implemented system of claim 1, wherein extracting one or more relevant texts from the article corpus further comprises identifying an entity using a name entity recognition (NER) technique.
9. The computer-implemented system of claim 1, wherein clustering a set of articles is based on density based spatial clustering to identify similar types of events within a predetermined time frame.
10. The computer-implemented system of claim 1, wherein the determined sentiment is further validated against one or more negative events using a dependency parsing technique.
11. The computer-implemented system of claim 1, wherein the weights and the plurality of filters are configurable by a user.
12. A computer-implemented method to determine an integrity due diligence risk associated with a third-party entity, comprising the steps of: extracting data from a plurality of data sources to form an article corpus; performing a de-duplication of each article from the article corpus based on a similarity index, wherein the de-duplication process is based on one or more of exact title, similar title and similar content; extracting one or more relevant texts from the article corpus by applying weights and a plurality of filters comprising one or more of an organization filter, negative vocabulary filter and a distance algorithm filter; clustering a set of articles corresponding to an event to identify similar articles; performing a classification of sentences to determine sentiment; identifying a risk event, wherein the risk event comprises one or more of: litigation, sanctions, adverse media, background and key individuals; calculating a risk score for each risk event; and based on the risk score, generating, via the user interface, an output wherein the output comprises a graphic that illustrates each risk event and supporting articles with one or more annotations generated via machine learning algorithm that identifies negative content.
13. The computer-implemented method of claim 12, wherein the risk score is associated with a third-party entity.
14. The computer-implemented method of claim 12, wherein the one or more annotations are based on a context-based approach based on a POS Tag of a word.
15. The computer-implemented method of claim 12, wherein the one or more annotations are based on a phrase extraction using metadata.
16. The computer-implemented method of claim 12, wherein the one or more annotations is based on an annotation relevance score that generates vector similarity score between each annotation and one or more dictionary words.
17. The computer-implemented method of claim 12, wherein the step of generating a risk event further comprises assessing litigation risk by identifying party and party type and performing conclusion analysis based on a pre-trained conclusion identifier model.
18. The computer-implemented method of claim 12, wherein the step of generating a risk score further comprises determining article-entity relevance, article-section relevance and risk relevance.
19. The computer-implemented method of claim 12, wherein the step of extracting one or more relevant texts from the article corpus further comprises identifying an entity using a name entity recognition (NER) technique.
20. The computer-implemented method of claim 12, wherein the step of clustering a set of articles is based on density based spatial clustering to identify similar types of events within a predetermined time frame.
21. The computer-implemented method of claim 12, wherein the determined sentiment is further validated against one or more negative events using a dependency parsing technique.
22. The computer-implemented method of claim 12, wherein the weights and the plurality of filters are configurable by a user.
