<title>
System and method for managing a mass gathering
</title>

<claims>
1. A system for managing a mass gathering on a geographical location, said system including an analytical platform associated with a plurality of image acquisition devices and network sensors distributed over the geographical location, the analytical platform including: a data acquisition module, adapted to acquire first participant distribution data generated from data from the plurality of image acquisition devices and to acquire second participant distribution data generated from data from the plurality of network sensors; a data processing module adapted, from the acquired first and second distribution data, to calculate based on a supervised or unsupervised learning correction model, a corrected distribution data item of participants in said gathering; and at least one access control device configured to control access between different areas of the geographical location.
2. The system according to claim 1, wherein the network sensors are able to connect to electronic devices via at least one communication protocol selected from: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GSM.
3. The system according to claim 1, wherein the correction model is selected from the following models: FP-Growth, Apriori, hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, neural network classification, decision trees and logistic regression.
4. The system according to claim 1, further including a pre-processing module configured to generate, from raw data from the plurality of network sensors, raw participant distribution data.
5. The system according to claim 1, wherein the analytical platform includes a data storage module adapted to store the acquired first and second distribution data and the corrected distribution data.
6. The system according to claim 1, wherein the analytical platform further includes a learning module adapted to implement a supervised or unsupervised learning model so as to: improve the correction model used for calculating the corrected distribution data, improve one or more pre-processing models used for generating raw distribution data from raw data from said image acquisition devices or said network sensors, and analyze the corrected distribution data.
7. The system according to claim 6, wherein the learning module is configured to analyze the corrected distribution data so as to generate predictive data selected from: critical distribution thresholds beyond which actions may be initiated so as to reduce a risk of a crowd movement, predicted distribution data, as a function of time, of participants in said gathering, and critical distribution patterns in the presence of which actions may be taken to reduce a risk of a crowd movement.
8. The system according to claim 7, wherein said critical distribution thresholds are by area.
9. The system according to claim 7, wherein said critical distribution patterns are between different areas.
10. The system according to claim 1, wherein the analytical platform includes an analysis module adapted to compare the corrected distribution data on said geographical location to predetermined critical distribution thresholds and to generate an alert based on the comparison result.
11. The system according to claim 10, said analysis module adapted to compare the corrected distribution data to said predetermined critical distribution thresholds in real time.
12. The system according to claim 1, wherein the data processing module is able to generate further distribution data selected from: a total amount of participants on the geographical location or on part of the geographical location, a density of participants on the geographical location or on part of the geographical location, and a number of people entering and leaving the geographical location or part of the geographical location.
13. A method for managing a mass gathering on a geographical location, said method being implemented by a system including an analytical platform and, on the geographical location, a plurality of image acquisition devices and network sensors, said platform including a data acquisition module and a data processing module, said method including the following steps: acquiring, via the acquisition data module, first participant distribution data generated from data from the plurality of image acquisition devices and second participant distribution data generated from data from the plurality of network sensors; calculating, via the data processing module, at least one corrected distribution data item of participants in said gathering, from the acquired first and second distribution data and based on a supervised or unsupervised learning model; and controlling access between different areas of the geographical location.
