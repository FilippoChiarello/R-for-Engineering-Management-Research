ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SERVER FOR CONTROLLING A PLURALITY OF ROBOTS USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
</title>

<abstract>
An artificial intelligence server for controlling a plurality of robots using artificial intelligence includes a communication unit configured to receive a captured image of each of a plurality of zones and a processor configured to acquire situation information of each zone based on the received image, acquire degrees of guidance urgency respectively corresponding to the plurality of zones based on the acquired situation information of each zone, determine whether there is a degree of guidance urgency greater than a predetermined value in the acquired degrees of guidance urgency, and, when there is a degree of guidance urgency greater than the predetermined value, transmit a first control command for moving one or more robots to a zone corresponding to the degree of guidance urgency.

<claims>
1. An artificial intelligence server for controlling a plurality of robots using artificial intelligence, the artificial intelligence server comprising: a communication unit configured to receive a captured image of each of a plurality of zones; and a processor configured to acquire situation information of each zone based on the received image, acquire degrees of guidance urgency respectively corresponding to the plurality of zones based on the acquired situation information of each zone, determine whether there is a degree of guidance urgency greater than a predetermined value in the acquired degrees of guidance urgency, and, when there is a degree of guidance urgency greater than the predetermined value, transmit a first control command for moving one or more robots to a zone corresponding to the degree of guidance urgency.
2. The artificial intelligence server of claim 1, wherein the situation information includes a density of each zone and the number of persons waiting to receive guidance services in each zone.
3. The artificial intelligence server of claim 2, further comprising a memory configured to store an image recognition model for recognizing users located in each zone and a waiting situation from an image, wherein the processor acquires the number of users located in each zone and the number of persons in the waiting situation through the image recognition model.
4. The artificial intelligence server of claim 3, wherein the image recognition model is an artificial neural network based model supervised-learned through a deep learning algorithm or a machine learning algorithm.
5. The artificial intelligence server of claim 4, wherein the processor calculates the degree of guidance urgency of each zone based on the density of each of the plurality of zones and the number of waiting persons.
6. The artificial intelligence server of claim 5, wherein the processor: gives a first weight to the density and gives a second weight to the number of waiting persons, and calculates the degree of guidance urgency of each zone according to the given first and second weights, and wherein the first weight is less than the second weight.
7. The artificial intelligence server of claim 6, wherein the processor transmits the first control command to a robot disposed in a zone having a smallest degree of guidance urgency.
8. The artificial intelligence server of claim 1, wherein the processor transmits, to the plurality of robots, a second control command for controlling movement of the robots such that each robot does not leave a zone corresponding thereto, when there is no degree of guidance urgency greater than the predetermined value in the acquired degrees of guidance urgency.
9. A method of operating an artificial intelligence server for controlling a plurality of robots using artificial intelligence, the method comprising: receiving a captured image of each of a plurality of zones; acquiring situation information of each zone based on the received images; acquiring degrees of guidance urgency respectively corresponding to the plurality of zones based on the acquired situation information of each zone; determining whether there is a degree of guidance urgency greater than a predetermined value in the acquired degrees of guidance urgency; and when there is a degree of guidance urgency greater than the predetermined value, transmitting a first control command for moving one or more robots to a zone corresponding to the degree of guidance urgency.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the situation information includes a density of each zone and the number of persons waiting to receive guidance services in each zone.
11. The method of claim 10, further storing an image recognition model for recognizing users located in each zone and a waiting situation from an image, wherein the acquiring of the situation information includes acquiring the number of users located in each zone and the number of persons in the waiting situation through the image recognition model.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the image recognition model is an artificial neural network based model supervised-learned through a deep learning algorithm or a machine learning algorithm.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the acquiring of the degrees of guidance urgency includes calculating the degree of guidance urgency of each zone based on the density of each of the plurality of zones and the number of waiting persons.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the acquiring of the degrees of guidance urgency includes: giving a first weight to the density and giving a second weight to the number of waiting persons, and calculating the degree of guidance urgency of each zone according to the given first and second weights, and wherein the first weight is less than the second weight.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the transmitting includes transmitting the first control command to a robot disposed in a zone having a smallest degree of guidance urgency.
16. The method of claim 9, further transmitting, to the plurality of robots, a second control command for controlling movement of the robots such that each robot does not leave a zone corresponding thereto, when there is no degree of guidance urgency greater than the predetermined value in the acquired degrees of guidance urgency.
