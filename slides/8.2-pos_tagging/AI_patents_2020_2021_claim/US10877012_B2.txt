<title>
Automatic siting for air quality monitoring stations
</title>

<abstract>
A system, a computer readable storage medium, and a method for automatically siting for air quality monitoring stations includes collecting from air quality monitoring stations air pollution concentration data, collecting from meteorological stations meteorological data, and interpolating, by the at least one or more processors, the air pollution concentration data to provide interpolated air pollution concentration data. The method and system can further cluster the interpolated air pollution concentration data and the meteorological data to provide clustered data and select a candidate site for an air monitoring station using the clustered data. The method and system can further evaluate a relationship of the air pollution concentration data with the meteorological data by weighting the air pollution data with the meteorological data.
