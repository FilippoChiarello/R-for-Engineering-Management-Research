CROSS-PLATFORM RATING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A rating may be received for a user based on a stay at a lodging establishment, the rating comprising a positive attribute and a negative attribute. The rating may be based on data entered by a user of the lodging establishment and programmatically generated data. An overall rating may be generated based on the rating and a plurality of prior ratings for the user. A request to reserve a second stay at the lodging establishment may be received. A price for the second stay at the lodging establishment may be received. A reduced price for the second stay may be determined based on the overall rating for the user being above a threshold rating. An indication of the reduced price may be outputted for display. A dwelling unit in the lodging establishment for the second stay may be reserved at the reduced price.
