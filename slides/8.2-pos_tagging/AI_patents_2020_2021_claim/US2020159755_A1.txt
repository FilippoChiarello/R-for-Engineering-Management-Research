SUMMARY GENERATING APPARATUS, SUMMARY GENERATING METHOD AND COMPUTER PROGRAM
</title>

<abstract>
A summary generating apparatus includes; a text storage device storing text with information indicating a portion to be focused on; word vector converters vectorizing each word of the text and adding an element indicating whether the word is focused on or not to the vector and thereby converting the text to a word vector sequence; an LSTM implemented by a neural network performing sequence-to-sequence type conversion, pre-trained by machine learning to output, in response to each of the word vectors of the word vector sequence input in a prescribed order, a summary of the text consisting of the words represented by the word sequence; and input units inputting each of the word vectors of the word vector sequence in the prescribed order to the neural network.

<claims>
1. A summary generating apparatus generating a summary of text, comprising: a text storage device storing the text with information indicating a portion to be focused on in the text; a word vector converting means for vectorizing each word of the text by a predetermined method and adding an element indicating whether or not the word is the portion to be focused on to the vector, thereby converting the text to a word vector sequence; a summarizing means implemented by a neural network performing sequence-to-sequence type conversion, trained beforehand by machine learning such that it outputs, in response to input of each of word vectors of the word vector sequence in a prescribed order, a summary of the text consisting of words represented by the word vector sequence; and an input means for inputting each of the word vectors of the word vector sequence converted by the word vector converting means to the neural network in the prescribed order.
2. The summary generating apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the text storage device is capable of storing, together with the text, information indicating a plurality of the portions to be focused on of the text.
3. The summary generating apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the neural network is a recurrent neural network.
4. The summary generating apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the neural network is LSTM.
5. A summary generating method of generating a summary of text using a computer, comprising the steps of: the computer storing the text with information indicating a portion to be focused on in the text in a text storage device; the computer vectorizing each word of the text stored in the text storage device by a predetermined method and adding an element indicating whether or not the word is the portion to be focused on to the vector, thereby converting the text to a word vector sequence; the computer calling a summarizing program implemented by a neural network performing sequence-to-sequence type conversion, trained beforehand by machine learning such that it outputs, in response to input of each of word vectors of the word vector sequence in a prescribed order, a summary of the text consisting of words represented by the word vector sequence; and the computer inputting each of the word vectors of the word vector sequence to the neural network in the prescribed order, and obtaining a word sequence output by the neural network in response to the input, as a summary of the text.
6. A non-transitory computer readable medium comprising a computer program stored thereon which, when executed, makes a computer function to execute the summary generating method according to claim 5.
