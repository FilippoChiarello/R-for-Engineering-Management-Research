Method for optically detecting biomarkers
</title>

<claims>
1. Method for optically detecting biomarkers in a biosensor, comprising: simultaneously acquiring (1100) spatially and spectrally resolved images from at least one sample of the biosensor with an optical scanner and performing an image analysis (1000) in parallel to the image acquisition (1100); wherein the image analysis (1000) comprises: reading (2100) data of the acquired images from storage means; correcting (2200) the read data to reduce inhomogeneities and noise of the acquired images; localizing (2300) particles in the acquired images using the corrected data to obtain a position for each particle; characterizing (2400) each particle individually to obtain an intermediate analysis result (5400) which comprises the position and characterization parameters for each particle; classifying (2500) the particles based on the characterization parameters of each particle to obtain classification groups of particles; counting (2600) a number of particles per classification group for each acquired image; calculating an overall analysis result (2800) which comprises at least one statistical value, which is calculated for each biomarker in each sample of the biosensor using the number of particles per classification group for all the images acquired from the same sample, wherein the at least one statistical value per sample is correlated with an indication of the presence of a biomarker in the sample.
2. Method according to claim 1, further comprising using the overall analysis result (2800) to control the optical scanner for the image acquisition (1100).
3. Method according to further claim 1, further comprising controlling (2700) at least a quality value of the intermediate analysis result (5400) obtained by the image analysis (1000) and at least a quality value of each acquired image, the quality values being used to correlate with the statistical values per sample calculated for the overall analysis result (2800).
4. Method according to claim 2, wherein the optical scanner acquires (1100) images from the sample until the quality values equal or exceed a target value.
5. Method according to claim 1, wherein simultaneously acquiring (1100) spatially and spectrally resolved images comprises: illuminating the biosensor at glazing angle with a broadband continuous spectrum; capturing scattered light from at least one sample; focusing the surface of the biosensor onto an optical sensor using an auto-focus system; producing, with a motorization unit, a relative movement in the three spatial coordinates between at least one sample of the biosensor and the optical scanner.
6. Method according to claim 1, wherein the overall analysis result (2800) per sample and for each biomarker further comprises a concentration of the biomarker.
7. Method according to claim 1, wherein the overall analysis result (2800) further comprises an estimation of the uncertainty of the calculated statistical value.
8. Method according to claim 1, wherein correcting (2200) the read data of the acquired images comprises: a background correction (3100) to adjust a black level of the image, correcting inhomogeneities (3200) of the brightness and/or color of the image, modifying the gamma curve (3300) of the image, smoothing (3400) the image to reduce image noise.
9. Method according to claim 1, wherein localizing (2300) particles in the acquired images comprises: generating at least one test pattern (4100) which represents a particle shape, calculating a cross-correlation image (4200) between the brightness and/or color of the image and the generated test pattern, defining a mask (4300) for the image based on the calculated cross-correlation image (4200), generating a grayscale mask (4400) using the previous defined mask (4300) and the cross-correlation image (4200), obtaining the position for each particle by localizing local maxima in the grayscale image (4400).
10. Method according to claim 1, wherein characterizing (2400) particles comprises: obtaining smoothed parameters (5100) of the brightness and/or color of each particle, evaluating (5200) the smoothed parameters (5100) at the obtained position of each particle to obtain mean values of the smoothed parameters (5100), obtaining parameters of additional characteristics (5300) of each particle, the parameters selected from at least particle size, particle shape, particle density and spectral characteristics of the particle; obtaining the characterization parameters of the intermediate analysis result (5400) as the mean values of smoothed parameters (5100) and the parameters of the additional characteristics (5300).
11. Method according claim 1, wherein classifying (2500) particles comprises: defining classification groups of particles (6200) based on the characterization parameters, and, in case of multiplexing (6300) a plurality of biomarkers, defining additional classification groups to account for all particles used in particle counting (2600), defining classification parameters and rules (6400) by mapping combinations of the characterization parameters into each classification group, performing a segmentation (6500) of the classification parameter space to obtain (6700), for each image, the classification group to which each particle localized in the image belongs.
12. Method according to claim 11, wherein classifying (2500) particles further comprises excluding particles (6100) from the particle counting (2600) based on the characterization parameters.
13. Method according to claim 1, wherein the counting (2600) of particles is weighted with at least one of the defined characterization or classification parameters.
14. Method according to claim 1, wherein reading (2100) data of the acquired images comprises accessing a memory of a computer in which the image analysis (1000) is running, the computer controlling the optical scanner for acquiring (1100) the images.
15. Method according to claim 1$, wherein reading (2100) data of the acquired images comprises accessing at least one storage device of a network with one or more computers in which the image analysis (1000) is running, and the optical scanner being controlled by another computer for acquiring (1100) the images different from any of the computers in which the image analysis (1000) is running.
16. Method according to claim 15, wherein the image analysis (1000) is split between multiple computers of the network, each computer running the image analysis (1000) for a subset of images acquired (1100) by the optical scanner.
17. Method according to claim 1, wherein the image analysis (1000) is performed sequentially by at least one computer, the at least one computer analyzing one image per time, or the image analysis (1000) is performed in parallel by at least one computer, the at least one computer analyzing multiple images per time.
