APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CROP YIELD PREDICTION
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the subject disclosure may include, for example, a device comprising: a processing system including a processor; and a memory that stores executable instructions that, when executed by the processing system, perform operations, the operations comprising: identifying an occurrence of one or multiple phenology stages of a crop, resulting in identified occurrences; optimizing, based upon the identified occurrences, a yield model, wherein the yield model produces, after the optimizing, a first predicted yield for a first region; and generating a second predicted yield based upon the first predicted yield, wherein the second predicted yield covers a second region that is smaller than the first region. Additional embodiments are disclosed.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. A device comprising:
a processing system including a processor; and
a memory that stores executable instructions that, when executed by the processing system, perform operations, the operations comprising:
identifying an occurrence of a phenology stage of a crop, resulting in an identified occurrence;
optimizing, based upon the identified occurrence, a yield model, wherein the yield model produces, after the optimizing, a first predicted yield for a first region; and
generating a second predicted yield based upon the first predicted yield, wherein the second predicted yield covers a second region that is smaller than the first region.
2. The device of claim 1, wherein the identified occurrence of the phenology stage comprises multiple phenology stages of the crop.
3. The device of claim 1, wherein the identifying is based upon satellite data.
4. The device of claim 3, wherein the satellite data comprises real-time satellite data.
5. The device of claim 1, wherein the identifying is further based upon ground-based phenology observation.
6. The device of claim 1, wherein the optimizing comprises optimizing based upon machine learning.
7. The device of claim 1, wherein the optimizing comprises applying a first weight to a first time window in which the identified occurrence occurred and applying a second weight to a second time window in which the identified occurrence did not occur, wherein the first weight is greater than the second weight.
8. The device of claim 1, wherein:
the first region is on a scale of a state or a county; and
the second region is on a scale of a field.
9. The device of claim 1, wherein the first predicted yield is based on an aggregation of a plurality of models of yields at a pixel scale or at a field scale within the first region.
10. The device of claim 1, wherein the crop is corn, soybean, wheat, rice, cotton, or other row crops.
11. A method comprising:
receiving satellite data associated with a crop;
identifying, based upon the satellite data, a first time window during which a phenology stage of the crop was prevalent;
optimizing a yield model, resulting in an optimized yield model, wherein the optimized yield model produces a first predicted yield for a first region, wherein the optimized yield model is based upon the first time window during which the phenology stage was prevalent, and wherein the first predicted yield is based on an aggregation of a plurality of models of yields at a pixel scale or at a field scale within the first region; and
predicting a second predicted yield that covers a second region that is smaller than the first region, wherein the second predicted yield is based upon the first predicted yield.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the identifying is further based upon ground-based phenology observation.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the optimizing comprises applying a first weight to the first time window in which the phenology stage was prevalent.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the optimizing comprises applying a second weight to a second time window in which the phenology stage was not prevalent, and wherein the first weight is greater than the second weight.
15. The method of claim 11, wherein the phenology stage comprises a reproductive period.
16. A non-transitory machine-readable storage medium comprising executable instructions that, when executed by a processing system including a processor, perform operations, the operations comprising:
receiving satellite data indicative of a prevalent occurrence of a phenology stage of a crop;
identifying, based upon the satellite data, a first time window during which the phenology stage of the crop was prevalent;
optimizing a yield model, resulting in an optimized yield model, wherein the optimized yield model is used to generate a first predicted yield for a first region, and wherein the optimized yield model is based upon the first time window during which the phenology stage of the crop was prevalent; and
using the first predicted yield to generate a second predicted yield that covers a second region that is smaller than the first region.
17. The non-transitory machine-readable storage medium of claim 16, wherein the optimizing comprises applying a first weight to the first time window during which the phenology stage of the crop was prevalent.
18. The non-transitory machine-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein the optimizing comprises applying a second weight to a second time window in which the phenology stage was not prevalent, and wherein the first weight is greater than the second weight.
19. The non-transitory machine-readable storage medium of claim 18, wherein the first time window comprises a first plurality of first sub-time windows, and wherein the second time window comprises a second plurality of second sub-time windows.
20. The non-transitory machine-readable storage medium of claim 16, wherein the first predicted yield is based on an aggregation of a plurality of models of yields at a pixel scale or at a field scale within the first region.
