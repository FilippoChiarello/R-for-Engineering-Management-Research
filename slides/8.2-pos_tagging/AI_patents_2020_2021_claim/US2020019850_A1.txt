</title>

<abstract>
An impulse-neuron-type neuromorphic circuit comprises a capacitor (Cmem) having a membrane voltage (Vmem), a first action comparator (1) for comparing the membrane voltage with a first action voltage (Vact, Vthreshold_high), a first regulation comparator (4) for comparing the membrane voltage with a first regulation voltage (Vreg), a device for reinitialising the membrane voltage (3) a register of threshold exceeds (5) and a regulator (2). The regulator is configured: in case of exceeding the first regulation voltage (Vreg Vthreshold_low) by the membrane voltage, to control the device for reinitialising the membrane voltage (3) and modify the register of threshold exceeds (5); and in case of exceeding the first action voltage (Vact Vthreshold_high) by the membrane voltage, to control the device for reinitialising the membrane voltage (3) and query the register of threshold exceeds to decide whether or not to generate an action potential (Spa) on an output of the neuromorphic circuit.
