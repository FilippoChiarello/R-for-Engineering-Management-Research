Energy operation apparatus, method, and system
</title>

<abstract>
An energy operation system, apparatus, and method capable of stably supplying energy and providing adjustment control based on prediction precision and planning precision for energy supply and demand. An energy operation apparatus includes a demand predictor, planner, evaluator, and solution quality controller. The demand predictor predicts demand and/or a power generation amount of future energy in a management area. The planner prepares a future energy supply plan in the management area based on a prediction. The evaluator evaluates supply and/or demand conditions including at least one of future weather in the management area, energy demand in the management area, a demand density and/or a generation density of future energy in the management area. The solution quality controller controls the quality of at least one of a prediction solution of the demand predictor and the energy supply plan of the planner based on an evaluation result from the evaluator.
