<title>
Minimum coordination passage scoring
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method, computerized apparatus and computer program product for minimum coordination passage scoring. Given a candidate passage in a document collection potentially matching a query received, a set of overlapping terms between the candidate passage and the query is determined. For each overlapping term in the set, a first measure of a weight of the term in the query, a second measure of a weight of the term in the candidate passage, and a third measure of a specificity of the term in the document collection are calculated. A function of the first and second measure is evaluated to obtain a value reflecting a condition on the relation therebetween. A minimum coordination score representing a relative similarity between the candidate passage and the query is determined based on the value and the first, second and third measures obtained for each of the overlapping terms.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: obtaining a set of candidate passages in a document collection, each of which candidate passages are potential matches for a query, wherein each candidate passage is characterized by having a lower overlapping terms occurrence than an overlapping terms occurrence in the query; for each candidate passage in the set, assigning a score by performing the steps of: determining a set of overlapping terms between the candidate passage and the query; calculating, for each overlapping term in the set, a first measure of a weight of the term in the query, a second measure of a weight of the term in the candidate passage, and a third measure of a specificity of the term in the document collection; evaluating a function of the first and second measure to obtain a value reflecting a condition on the relation therebetween; and determining, based on the value and the first, second and third measures obtained for each of the overlapping terms, a minimum coordination score representing a relative similarity between the candidate passage and the query, wherein said determining the minimum coordination score comprises performing a summation over all terms in the set of overlapping terms, wherein the summation is normalized, wherein said determining the minimum coordination score comprises computing the minimum coordination score of the candidate passage irrespective of other candidate passages, wherein the score is assigned in accordance with the formula: wherein p is the candidate passage, wherein q is the query, wherein tf is a term frequency in a passage, wherein idf is an inverse document frequency of a term in a document collection.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the condition mandates that the second measure does not exceed the first measure.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 2, wherein the function is a minimum function, whereby the value obtained is the smallest argument of the function.
4. A computer-implemented method comprising: obtaining a set of candidate passages in a document collection, each of which candidate passages are potential matches for a query, wherein each candidate passage is characterized by having a lower overlapping terms occurrence than an overlapping terms occurrence in the query; for each candidate passage in the set, assigning a score by performing the steps of: determining a set of overlapping terms between the candidate passage and the query; calculating, for each overlapping term in the set, a first measure of a weight of the term in the query, a second measure of a weight of the term in the candidate passage, and a third measure of a specificity of the term in the document collection; evaluating a function of the first and second measure to obtain a value reflecting a condition on the relation therebetween; and determining, based on the value and the first, second and third measures obtained for each of the overlapping terms, a minimum coordination score representing a relative similarity between the candidate passage and the query, wherein said determining the minimum coordination score comprises computing the minimum coordination score of the candidate passage irrespective of other candidate passages, wherein the minimum coordination score is a loose minimum coordination score obtained by a relaxation operation, wherein the score is assigned in accordance with the formula: wherein p is the candidate passage, wherein q is the query, wherein β is the relaxation parameter, wherein tf is a term frequency in a passage, wherein idf is an inverse document frequency of a term in a document collection.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, further comprising, prior to said obtaining and/or assigning the score, applying a machine learning process whereby at least one relaxation parameter for use in the relaxation operation, is determined.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 4, wherein each of the at least one relaxation parameter is learned individually for each term of the document collection.
7. A computer-implemented method comprising: obtaining a set of candidate passages in a document collection, each of which candidate passages are potential matches for a query, wherein each candidate passage is characterized by having a lower overlapping terms occurrence than an overlapping terms occurrence in the query; for each candidate passage in the set, assigning a score by performing the steps of: determining a set of overlapping terms between the candidate passage and the query; calculating, for each overlapping term in the set, a first measure of a weight of the term in the query, a second measure of a weight of the term in the candidate passage, and a third measure of a specificity of the term in the document collection; evaluating a function of the first and second measure to obtain a value reflecting a condition on the relation therebetween; and determining, based on the value and the first, second and third measures obtained for each of the overlapping terms, a minimum coordination score representing a relative similarity between the candidate passage and the query, wherein said determining the minimum coordination score comprises computing the minimum coordination score of the candidate passage irrespective of other candidate passages, wherein the minimum coordination score is a loose minimum coordination score obtained by a relaxation operation, wherein each of the at least one relaxation parameter is learned individually for each term of the document collection, wherein the score is assigned in accordance with the formula: wherein p is the candidate passage, wherein q is the query, wherein βt is a relaxation parameter for a term t, wherein idf is an inverse document frequency of a term in a document collection.
