<title>
MANAGEMENT OF VEHICLES ON PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE
</title>

<abstract>
A centralized asset management system for enforcement of asset parameters on assets that utilize public infrastructure. Assets may include shareable dockless mobility vehicles such as dockless scooters, bicycles, or the like. Assets may also include autonomous vehicles such as delivery drones or autonomous ride share vehicles. The system receives asset data such as the geolocation of an asset an compares the asset data to asset parameters. For example, asset parameters may include defined areas regarding the operation of assets such as areas for asset parking or the like. The system may allow a municipality user to access the system to define the asset parameters. The system may include interfaces with asset operators and the municipality to share relevant data regarding the assets or their operation.

<claims>
1. 1.-22. (canceled)
23. A method for management of a dockless mobility vehicle (DMV) by an asset management system for operation of the DMV with an asset parameter regarding a helmet, comprising: receiving information from a DMV regarding use of a helmet by a user of the DMV; comparing the information from the DMV regarding the use of the helmet to an asset parameter regarding use of a helmet with the DMV; determining compliance with the asset parameter based on the information from the DMV regarding the use of the helmet; and communicating a message from the asset management system in response to a determining compliance with the asset parameter.
24. The method of claim 1, wherein the information from the DMV regarding the use of the helmet is based on an output of a physical sensor at the DMV indicative of the use of the helmet.
25. The method of claim 2, wherein the physical sensor detects a signal indicative of the presence of a helmet being used by the user.
26. The method of claim 3, wherein the signal comprises a verification transmission between a helmet and the DMV.
27. The method of claim 2, wherein the message comprises a warning of noncompliance when the physical sensor detects that the use is not in compliance with the asset parameter.
28. The method of claim 5, wherein the message comprises a citation including a monetary fine for noncompliance.
29. The method of claim 2, wherein the message comprises a positive reward in response when the physical sensor detects that the use is in compliance with the asset parameter.
30. The method of claim 7, wherein the positive reward comprises a discount for the use of the DMV.
31. The method of claim 1, wherein the message is delivered to a user device of the user utilizing the DMV.
32. The method of claim 1, wherein the asset parameter is established by at least one of a municipality or DVM operator in which the DMV is in operation.
33. An asset management system for management of a dockless mobility vehicle (DMV) for operation of the DMV with an asset parameter regarding a helmet, comprising: one or more network interfaces to receive information from a DMV regarding use of a helmet by a user of the DMV; a datastore including an asset parameter regarding use of a helmet with the DMV; a compliance engine operative to compare the information from the DMV regarding the use of the helmet to the asset parameter for the DMV to determine compliance with the asset parameter based on the information from the DMV regarding the use of the helmet; and a messaging interface to communicate a message from the asset management system in response to a determining compliance with the asset parameter.
34. The system of claim 11, further comprising: a physical sensor at the DMV, wherein the information from the DMV regarding the use of the helmet is based on an output of the physical sensor at the DMV indicative of the use of the helmet.
35. The system of claim 12, wherein the physical sensor detects a signal indicative of the presence of a helmet being used by the user.
36. The system of claim 13, wherein the signal comprises a verification transmission between a helmet and the DMV.
37. The system of claim 12, wherein the message comprises a warning of noncompliance when the physical sensor detects that the use is not in compliance with the asset parameter.
38. The system of claim 15, wherein the message comprises a citation including a monetary fine for noncompliance.
39. The system of claim 12, wherein the message comprises a positive reward in response when the physical sensor detects that the use is in compliance with the asset parameter.
40. The system of claim 17, wherein the positive reward comprises a discount for the use of the DMV.
41. The system of claim 11, wherein the message is delivered to a user device of the user utilizing the DMV.
41. The system of claim 11, wherein the asset parameter is established by at least one of a municipality or DMV operator in which the DMV is in operation.
