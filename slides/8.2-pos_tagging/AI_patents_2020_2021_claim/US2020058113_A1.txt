IMAGE PROCESSING APPARATUS AND IMAGE PROCESSING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed is an image processing apparatus. The present image processing apparatus comprises: an input unit for inputting an image; and a processor for shrinking the inputted image to a predetermined ratio, extracting a visual feature from the shrunken image, performing an image quality enhancement process reflecting the extracted visual feature in the inputted image, repeatedly performing, for a predetermined number of times, the shrinking, the extracting, and the image quality enhancement process on the image that has undergone the image quality enhancement process. The present disclosure relates to an artificial intelligence (AI) system and an application thereof that simulate the functions of a human brain, such as recognition, judgment, etc., by using a machine learning algorithm such as deep learning, etc.

<claims>
1. An image processing apparatus comprising: an input unit configured to receive an image; and a processor configured to reduce the received image to a predetermined ratio, extract a visual feature from the reduced image, perform an image quality enhancement process in which the extracted visual feature is reflected in the received image, and repeatedly perform, for a predetermined number of times, the reducing, the extracting, and the image quality enhancement process on the image subjected to the image quality enhancement process.
2. The image processing apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processor performs the image quality enhancement process by partitioning the received image into a plurality of regions each of which has a size corresponding to a size of the reduced image, reflecting the extracted visual feature in each of the plurality of partitioned regions, and overlapping the plurality of regions, in which the extracted visual feature is reflected, with each other.
3. The image processing apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein the processor reduces the received image based on each of a plurality of reference points in the received image and extracts a visual feature from each of a plurality of reduced images.
4. The image processing apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein the plurality of reference points correspond to the plurality of regions, respectively, and the processor reflects visual features in the plurality of partitioned regions, respectively, the visual features being extracted from the images reduced based on the reference points corresponding to the plurality of regions.
5. The image processing apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the extracted visual feature is at least one of a brightness, a color, a darkness, a saturation, a contrast, shapes and density of edges, or a color arrangement.
6. The image processing apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the predetermined ratio is a value in a range from 0.9 to 0.99.
7. The image processing apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processor determines a degradation state of the received image, and determines the predetermined number of times for which the reducing, the extracting, and the image quality enhancement process are repeatedly performed, depending on the determined degradation state.
8. The image processing apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processor performs a pre-processing for enhancing an image quality of the received image, and performs the image quality enhancement process by reflecting a visual feature extracted from a reduced image in which the pre-processed image is reduced by the predetermined ratio, on the pre-processed image.
9. The image processing apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the processor determines whether or not a pattern region having a predetermined frequency range is included in the received image, repeatedly performs the reducing, the extracting, and the image quality enhancement process on the pattern region in a case in which the pattern region is included in the received image, and performs the reducing, the extracting, and the image quality enhancement process on a region other than the pattern region only once.
10. The image processing apparatus as claimed in claim 1, further comprising: a display configured to display the image repeatedly subjected to the image quality enhancement process for the predetermined number of times.
11. The image processing apparatus as claimed in claim 1, further comprising: a communicator configured to transmit, to a display device, the image repeatedly subjected to the image quality enhancement process for the predetermined number of times.
12. An image processing method comprising: receiving an image; reducing the received image to a predetermined ratio; extracting a visual feature from the reduced image; performing an image quality enhancement process in which the extracted visual feature is reflected in the received image; and repeatedly performing, for a predetermined number of times, the reducing, the extracting, and the image quality enhancement process on the image subjected to the image quality enhancement process.
13. The image processing method as claimed in claim 12, wherein the performing of the image quality enhancement process includes: partitioning the received image into a plurality of regions each of which has a size corresponding to a size of the reduced image; reflecting the extracted visual feature in each of the plurality of partitioned regions; and overlapping the plurality of regions, in which the extracted visual feature is reflected, with each other.
14. The image processing method as claimed in claim 13, wherein in the reducing, the received image is reduced based on each of a plurality of reference points in the received image, and in the extracting, a visual feature is extracted from each of a plurality of reduced images.
15. The image processing method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the plurality of reference points correspond to the plurality of regions, respectively, and in the reflecting, visual features are reflected in the plurality of partitioned regions, respectively, the visual features being extracted from the images reduced based on the reference points corresponding to the plurality of regions.
