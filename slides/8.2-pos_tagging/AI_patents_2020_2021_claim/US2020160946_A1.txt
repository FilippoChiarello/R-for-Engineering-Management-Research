LONGITUDINAL DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A longitudinal data quality assurance system is operable to receive a set of medical scans corresponding to a same first patient. A first chronologically ordered list of the set of medical scans is generated based on a corresponding first set of dates, where each of the corresponding first set of dates are extracted from a headers of the set of medical scans. Quality assurance data is generated for the first chronologically ordered list by performing at least one quality assurance function on at least one of the set of medical scans. A second chronologically ordered list that includes a first subset of the first set of medical scans is generated to rectify at least one continuity error of the first chronologically ordered list, indicated in the quality assurance data. The second chronologically ordered list is transmitted to a client device for display via a display device.
