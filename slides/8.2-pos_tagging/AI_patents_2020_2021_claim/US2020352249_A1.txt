USER INTERFACE AND USER EXPERIENCE FOR A VAPORIZER DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
Vaporizers and vaporizer systems, which can include a device in communication with a vaporizer, can include one or more features related to control of functions and/or features of the vaporizer, identification of a cartridge and/or a vaporizable material in the cartridge, data exchange (either one-way or two-way) between a cartridge and a vaporizer with which the cartridge is engaged, and the like.
</abstract>

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method comprising: accessing, through operation of an application executing on one or more programmable processors, information regarding a vaporizer; presenting information about the vaporizer using a user interface generated on a display by the one or more processors; receiving a user input by interaction of a user with the user interface; and causing the vaporizer to operate consistent with one or more parameters determined by the one or more processors in accordance with the user input.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: pairing a communication device with the vaporizer, the pairing comprising establishing a wireless communication channel between first communication hardware of the device and second communication hardware of the vaporizer, wherein the communication device comprises the one or more processors and the display, wherein the accessing comprises an exchange of first data between the vaporizer and the communication device over the wireless communication channel, and wherein the causing the vaporizer to operate consistent with the one or more parameters comprises transmitting data to the vaporizer from the communication device.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the information comprises one or more of desired effects, user reviews, recommendations of use, crowdsourced information, and cartridge information.
4. The method of claim 2, wherein the causing the vaporizer to operate consistent with one or more parameters comprises disabling the vaporizer based on location with respect to one or more beacons or one or more geo-fenced areas.
5. The method of claim 2, wherein the causing the vaporizer to operate consistent with one or more parameters comprises associating the vaporizer with a purchase location.
6. The method of claim 2, wherein the vaporizer comprises a cartridge and a vaporizer body configured to be coupled to one another, the cartridge comprising an identifier, a heater, a source of vaporizable material, and a pair of cartridge contacts, and the vaporizer body comprising a power source, a controller, and a pair of vaporizer body contacts in communication with the controller, wherein when coupled the pair of vaporizer body contacts on the vaporizer body are engaged with the pair of cartridge contacts on the cartridge; wherein the identifier comprises a cartridge memory storing the information, and wherein engagement of the pair of cartridge contacts and the pair of vaporizer body contacts forms a data exchange circuit via which data are passed between the memory and the controller; and wherein accessing information regarding the vaporizer comprises accessing information encoded by the identifier.
