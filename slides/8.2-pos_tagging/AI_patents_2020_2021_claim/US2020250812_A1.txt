METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR IMAGE ANALYSIS
</title>

<abstract>
In a system and method for analyzing images, an input image is provided to a computer and is processed therein with a first deep learning model so as to generate an output result for the input image; and applying a second deep learning model is applied to the input image to generate an output confidence score that is indicative of the reliability of any output result from the first deep learning model for the input image.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for processing an image, the method comprising: receiving an input image and process the input image with a first deep learning model to generate an output result for the input image; and applying a second deep learning model to the input image to generate an output confidence score which is indicative of the reliability of the output result from the first deep learning model for the input image.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the first deep learning model and the second deep learning model have been trained on the same training data.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein applying the second deep learning model to generate an output confidence score comprises: generating a reconstructed image; and comparing the reconstructed image with the input image to generate the output confidence score.
4. The method of claim 3, comprising generating the output confidence score using mean square error or structural similarity.
5. The method of claim 1 further comprising determining whether the output confidence score is within a confidence interval.
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising outputting an alert when it is determined that the output confidence score is outside a confidence interval.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising outputting a high alert when it is determined that the output confidence score is outside a relatively narrow confidence interval and outputting a low alert when it is determined that the output confidence score is outside a relatively broad confidence interval.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising applying the first deep learning model to the input image and simultaneously outputting the output confidence score and the output result.
9. The method of claim 1 wherein applying the second deep learning model to generate an output confidence score comprises: generating a reconstructed image; applying the first deep learning model to the reconstructed image; calculating a first loss value based on the input image and the output result using the reconstructed image, and generating the output confidence score using the first loss value.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising calculating a second loss value using the reconstructed image and the input image and generating the output confidence score using both the first loss value and the second loss value.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the second deep learning model is an autoencoder.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising applying a third deep learning model to generate a second output confidence score by: generating a reconstructed image; applying the first deep learning model to the reconstructed image; calculating a first loss value based on the input image and the output result using the reconstructed image, and generating the second output confidence score using the first loss value.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising calculating a second loss value using the reconstructed image and the input image and generating the output confidence score using both the first loss value and the second loss value.
14. A non-transitory, computer-readable data storage medium encoded with programming instructions that, when the storage medium is loaded into a computer, cause the computer to: receive an input image and process the input image with a first deep learning model to generate an output result for the input image; and apply a second deep learning model to the input image to generate an output confidence score which is indicative of the reliability of the output result from the first deep learning model for the input image.
15. An image processing system comprising an image capture device configured to capture an image; an image processor configured to receive said image from the image capture device as an input image, and to process said input image with a first deep learning model to generate an output result for the input image, and apply a second deep learning model to the input image to generate an output confidence score that is indicative of the reliability of the output result from the first deep learning model for the input image; and a user interface configured to display at least one of the output confidence score and the output result that are generated by the image processor.
