TECHNIQUE FOR PERFORMING A QUALITY ASSESSMENT FOR A MEDICAL IMAGE
</title>

<abstract>
A technique for performing a feedback-based quality assessment for a medical image acquired by a medical imaging device is disclosed. A method implementation of the technique comprises determining (S108) a level of image quality for the acquired medical image using an assessment component configured to assess image quality levels based on feedback of physicians collected for previously acquired medical images.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for performing a feedback-based quality assessment for a medical image acquired by a medical imaging device (512), the method comprising:
determining (S108) a level of image quality for the acquired medical image (602) using an assessment component (514) configured to assess image quality levels based on feedback of physicians collected for previously acquired medical images.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the assessment component (514) comprises a machine learning module trained to predict a satisfaction level of a physician or a group of physicians based on the feedback of physicians collected for previously acquired medical images.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2, further comprising:
acquiring (S106), prior to determining (S108) the level of image quality, the medical image (602) by the medical imaging device (512).
4. The method of any one of claim 1 to 3, further comprising:
providing (S110) the acquired medical image (602) to a physician when the determined level of image quality exceeds a predetermined threshold.
5. The method of claim 3 or 4, wherein acquiring (S106) the medical image (602) is performed as part of an examination and wherein the method further comprises:
repeating (S112) acquiring the medical image (602) by the medical imaging device (512) with a different configuration within the examination when the determined level of image quality does not exceed a predetermined threshold.
6. The method of any one of claims 1 to 5, further comprising:
collecting (S114) feedback on the image quality level of the acquired medical image (602) from a physician and using the collected feedback for selecting reference images (604) representative of desired image quality levels for particular types of medical images.
7. The method of any one of claims 2 to 6, further comprising:
collecting (S114) feedback on the image quality level of the acquired medical image (602) from a physician and using the collected feedback for training the machine learning module to predict satisfaction levels of physicians or groups of physicians for medical images.
8. The method of any one of claims 3 to 7, further comprising: selecting (S102), prior to acquiring (S106) the medical image (602), a reference image (604) from a plurality of reference images (604), each of the plurality of reference images (604) being stored in association with a set of acquisition parameters which has been used to acquire the respective reference image (604); and configuring (S104) the medical imaging device (512) by the set of acquisition parameters stored in association with the selected reference image (604) for acquiring the medical image (602).
9. The method of claim 8, wherein each of the plurality of reference images (604) is previously selected as being representative of a desired level of image quality for a particular type of medical image.
10. The method of claim 8 or 9, wherein the medical imaging device (512) is one of a plurality of medical imaging devices (512) distributed across a plurality of sites and wherein the plurality of reference images (604) is stored in a central repository (504) configured to distribute the plurality of reference images (604) to the plurality of medical imaging devices (512).
11. The method of claim 10, wherein, in each of the plurality of sites, a local subset of the central repository (504) is maintained, wherein each local subset is synchronized with the central repository (504).
12. The method of claim 10 or 11, wherein, in the central repository (504), the plurality of reference images (604) is categorized by at least one of: medical imaging device types, standard image sets and/or physician specific image sets, body regions, and anatomical parts.
13. The method of any one of claims 8 to 12, wherein each of the plurality of reference images (604) is stored in association with a standard operating procedure, SOP, to be adhered to when acquiring the medical image (602) using the set of acquisition parameters stored in association with the respective reference image (604) .
14. The method of any one of claims 10 to 13, wherein, in the central repository (504), sequences of reference images (604) are defined, wherein the medical imaging device (512) is configurable by each of the sequences to acquire a respective series of medical images (602) in accordance with the sets of acquisition parameters stored in association with the reference images (604) of the respective sequence, and, optionally,
wherein reference images (604) of the sequences are stored by reference to corresponding reference images (604) of the plurality of reference images (604).
15. A system for performing a feedback-based quality assessment for a medical image acquired by a medical imaging device (512), the system comprising:
an assessment component (514) configured to determine (S108) a level of image quality for the acquired medical image (602), wherein the assessment component (514) assesses image quality levels based on feedback of physicians collected for previously acquired medical images.
