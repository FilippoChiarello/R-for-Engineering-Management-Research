Patent Claims
1. A computer-implemented method for providing a test pool (TP) of configurations used to test components of a configu rable technical system using an artificial neural network (6) trained on system configuration instances stored in a data base ( 1 ) .
2. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1, wherein the test pool (TP) comprises candidate configurations forming a subset of system configuration instances stored in the database (1) used to test whether components of the con figurable technical system behave as expected.
3. The computer-implemented method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein each system configuration instance stored in the da tabase (1) is represented by a network model, MOD, comprising nodes, n, each representing an individual configuration item and connections between nodes, n, each representing a domainspecific relationship between configuration items.
4. The computer-implemented method according to claim 3, wherein at least some nodes of the network model, MOD, com prise associated attributes, Attr, which describe a type, a role, a function and/or a capability of the respective con figuration item represented by the respective nodes, n.
5. The computer-implemented method according to claim 3 or 4, wherein for each root node, nx, of a network model, MOD, neighboring nodes, ny, are sampled in a stochastic process with a predetermined walk length, L, to provide node pairs (nx, ny) used for training the artificial neural network (6) .
6. The computer-implemented method according to claim 5, wherein for each sampled node pair (nx, ny) a set of nodes is sampled to provide contextual information about the local en vironment of the respective node pair within the network mod el, MOD.
7. The computer-implemented method according to claim 6, wherein for each node of a sample set of nodes its associated attributes, Attr, are queried from the database, DB, and en coded into a corresponding attribute vector, a.
8. The computer-implemented method according to claim 7, wherein the attribute vectors, a, of the sample set of nodes, n, around the root node, nx, are aggregated and concatenated to an attribute vector, a, of the root node, nx, to provide a concatenated vector, c, fed into the artificial neural net work (6) to calculate iteratively a node-level latent repre sentation vector, V.
9. The computer-implemented method according to claim 8, wherein the node-level latent representation vector, V, is calculated until a convergence of a predetermined loss func tion, LF, is achieved or a predetermined limit of iterations is reached to provide the trained artificial neural network (6) .
10. The computer-implemented method according to claim 9, wherein the trained artificial neural network (6) calculates a learned latent vector representation for each node, n, of the network models, MOD, stored in the database (1) repre senting instances of the individual configuration of items assembled into a matrix, M.
11. The computer-implemented method according to claim 10, wherein a similarity between two system configuration in stances of the configurable technical system stored in the database (1) and represented respectively by associated net work models, MOD, is determined by performing a matrix multi plication of the respective matrices, M, to calculate a simi larity matrix, SM, indicating a similarity between each node, n, of a network model, MOD, representing a first system con figuration instance of the configurable technical system and each node, n, of a network model, MOD, representing a second system configuration instance of the configurable technical system.
12. The computer-implemented method according to claim 11, wherein a maximum similarity value in each row of the calcu lated similarity matrix, SM, is extracted to provide a simi larity vector, S, that captures a similarity between the con figuration items.
13. The computer-implemented method according to claim 12, wherein a similarity between system configuration instances is calculated by computing an aggregate over a distribution of individual configuration items.
14. The computer-implemented method according to any of the preceding claims 1 to 13, wherein the test pool (TP) of con figurations is generated on the basis of the calculated simi larities between the system configuration instances.
