<abstract>
A workstation for neurobiological disorder health professionals that aids professionals tracking, evaluating and archiving clinical and educational progress through a web application using 360-degree video. The invention allows for organized communication between internal and external resources of an institution to tackle patient/student needs that merit immediate attention from specialists either in an individual or group setting. For additional expertise in acute cases, the institution can get access to consult with specialists around the world through the invention's directory of professionals. The invention allows clinical supervisors to train staff and ensure consistency in therapeutic interventions and evaluations, as well as supervisors in a school setting for consistency in educational programming. The invention also accelerates staff training time through targeted supervision.
