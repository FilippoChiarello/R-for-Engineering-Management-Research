<title>
Proactive suggestion for sharing of meeting content
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to processing operations configured for management of proactive suggestion(s) that may be utilized to manage the sharing of meeting content. The present disclosure further describes optimization of a user interface whereby a user interface experience is improved through new user interface features and actions that enable proactive presentation of suggestions for syncing content with a meeting as well as sharing synced content. Various intelligent signals such as user's calendar, GPS location, camera roll content, capture content (including OCR, whiteboard detection, etc.) and capture time, are collected and analyzed to make smart suggestions to the user to share content with specific set of people (e.g., those involved in meeting). Processing described herein enables contextual correlation between specific content and a scheduled meeting, whereby results of that contextual correlation can be used to execute programmed actions to improve efficiency for computing devices and users.

3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: analyzing the image content and data associated with the image content, wherein the detecting that the image content is captured comprises correlating of the image content with the electronically scheduled meeting by matching a timestamp of a capture time of the image content with a timestamp associated with the occurrence of the electronically scheduled meeting.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the analyzing of the signal data further comprises parsing meeting details associated with the electronic meeting invite of the electronically scheduled meeting, and wherein the user interface prompt is further pre-populated with a meeting name for the electronically scheduled meeting based on a result of the parsing of the meeting details.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the analyzing of the signal data further comprises parsing meeting details associated with the electronic meeting invite of the electronically scheduled meeting, and the method further comprising: surfacing a user interface save prompt, through a user interface of a distributed storage application or service after the predetermined time period has elapsed after the electronically scheduled meeting time has concluded, to save the image content to a storage folder associated with the electronically scheduled meeting, and wherein the user interface save prompt is automatically pre-populated with a meeting name, for the electronically scheduled meeting, as the storage folder based on a result of the parsing of the meeting details of the electronic meeting invite.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the detecting that the image content is capture further comprises detecting that the image content is actively captured through a mode of operation of a distributed storage application or service, and wherein the method further comprising: collecting the signal data associated with the electronically scheduled meeting from the distributed storage application or service, and wherein the analyzing analyzes the signal data collected from the distributed storage or service in detecting that the image content is captured during the occurrence of the electronically scheduled meeting.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the detecting that the image content is capture further comprises detecting access to captured image content through a camera application or service, and wherein the method further comprising: collecting the signal data associated with the electronically scheduled meeting the camera application or service and wherein the analyzing analyzes the signal data collected from the camera application or service in detecting that the image content is captured during the occurrence of the electronically scheduled meeting.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the presenting presents the user interface prompt as a notification through the user interface of a distributed storage application or service.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the analyzing of the signal data further comprises parsing meeting details associated with the electronic meeting invite of the electronically scheduled meeting to identify a title of the electronically scheduled meeting, and wherein the message prompt provides, as the identification of the image content, a name for the image content that includes the title of the electronically scheduled meeting.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the message prompt is a reminder to a user to associate the image content with a specific file repository corresponding with the electronically scheduled meeting, and wherein the message prompt comprises text identifying the reminder to the user to associate the image content with the specific file repository for the electronically scheduled meeting.
11. A system comprising: at least one processor; and a memory, operatively connected with the at least one processor, storing computer-executable instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, causes the at least one processor to execute a method that comprises: analyzing signal data associated with an electronic meeting invite of an electronically scheduled meeting for a user account that is an attendee for the electronically scheduled meeting, wherein the analyzing of the signal data comprises: detecting an occurrence of the electronically scheduled meeting, and detecting an attendance status of invitees associated with the electronic meeting invite of the electronically scheduled meeting; detecting that image content is captured during the occurrence of the electronically scheduled meeting by a computing device associated with the user account; after detecting that a predetermined time period has elapsed after the electronically scheduled meeting time has concluded, automatically generating a message prompt configured to aid sharing of the image content with one or more invitees of the electronically scheduled meeting, wherein the automatically generating of the message prompt comprises pre-populating the message prompt with an identification of the image content and contact data for the one or more invitees based on the detected attendee status of the invitees from the electronic meeting invite; and presenting, through a user interface of an application or service, the message prompt.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the method, executed by the at least one processor, further comprises: parsing meeting details associated with the electronic meeting invite of the electronically scheduled meeting, and wherein the presenting comprises pre-populating the message prompt with contact data for one or more invitees that have accepted the electronic meeting invite for the electronically scheduled meeting based on a result of the parsing of the meeting details associated with the electronic meeting invite.
