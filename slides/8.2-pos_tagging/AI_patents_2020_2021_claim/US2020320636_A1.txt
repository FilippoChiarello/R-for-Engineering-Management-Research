<abstract>
A system and method for automatically analyzing information related to a workers' compensation claim and for providing a corresponding case analysis report. A licensed user computer is programmed to upload via a computer network documents and data related to a workers' compensation claim and then to receive a downloaded case analysis report comprising analysis and a recommended plan of action regarding the workers' compensation claim. A server computer is programmed to receive the documents and data related to the workers' compensation claim. The server computer includes programming for a pdf/image text extractor, a checklist data provider, an information identifier, a natural language processor, an issue identifier, an issue analyzer, and a decision data model. The server computer is programmed to generate the case analysis report and to download the report to the licensed user computer.
