SMART DEPLOYAI DATA PIPELINE DIGITAL SIGNING & ENCRYPTION
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to a method for encrypting a data pipeline in a computer system. A device receives a request to encrypt a data pipeline. The device can also receive encrypted stages of a data pipeline that are encrypted by an encryption key. The device can generate random locations in storage where the data pipeline stages will be stored. The random locations can be generated in response to the data pipeline stages being encrypted. The random storage locations can be stored in a mapping file. The mapping file can be selected to store the random locations based on the random storage locations being generated. The device can encrypt the mapping file based on the mapping file storing the random storage locations. The device can place the encrypted mapping file in memory.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving by a device a request to encrypt a data pipeline, the request to encrypt a plurality of stages of the data pipeline; receiving by the device encrypted stages of the pipeline, the stages being encrypted by an encryption key provided to the device; generating by the device random locations in storage where the pipeline stages will be stored, wherein the random storage locations are generated in response to the encrypted stages of the data pipeline; storing by the device the random storage locations in a mapping file, the mapping file selected to store the random storage locations based on the random storage locations being generated; encrypting by the device the mapping file, the mapping file being encrypted based on storing the random storage locations; and storing by the device the encrypted mapping file in memory.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: storing an original digital signature in the mapping file or a separate storage location.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein an external source provides the encryption key to encrypt the stages of the data pipeline.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: the device encrypting the mapping file with a different encryption key after the random storage locations are stored in the mapping file.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising: the device approving the stages of the data pipeline before the stages of the data pipeline are encrypted.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: tracking a digital signature of the data pipeline after the device approves the stages of the data pipeline.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the stages of the data pipeline include at least one of a data transform stage, data storage stage and a data modeling stage.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: storing an original digital signature for the data pipeline stages, the original digital signature being stored within a separate storage location.
9. A method comprising: receiving a request by a device to decrypt a data pipeline, the request including a request to decrypt stages of the data pipeline; searching by the device for locations of the stages of the data pipeline, the search based on the request to decrypt the data pipeline; locating the stages to the data pipeline by the device as a result of the search for the locations of the stages to the data pipeline; receiving by the device an authentication key to unlock the stages of the data pipeline, the authentication key being received as a result of the stages of the data pipeline being located; and reassembling the data pipeline by the device based on the authentication key unlocking the stages of the data pipeline.
10. The method of claim 9, further comprising: resigning the data pipeline by the device after the data pipeline has been reassembled.
11. The method of claim 9, further comprising: checking a digital signature of the reassembled data pipeline with an original signature of the data pipeline.
12. The method of claim 9, further comprising: reassembling the stages of the data pipeline based on assembly instructions stored in a mapping file.
13. The method of claim 9, wherein the device reassembles each of the original stages to the data pipeline.
14. The method of claim 9, wherein the device reassembles the stages to the data pipeline in a predetermined order.
15. The method of claim 9, further comprising: matching a digital signature of the reassembled data pipeline with an original signature of the data pipeline.
16. The method of claim 9, further comprising: allowing the data pipeline to be used for additional applications, the data pipeline being available based on the data pipeline being reassembled.
17. A network computer system comprising: one or more processors; a set of memory resources to store a set of instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to: receive a request to encrypt a data pipeline, the data pipeline including a data transform, data storage, and a data modeling stage; encrypt the data transform, data storage, and data modeling stages, the stages of the data pipeline encrypted based on receipt of the request to encrypt the data pipeline; generate random storage locations to store the stages of the data pipeline, the random storage locations generated based on the stages of the data pipeline stages being encrypted; store the random storage locations in a mapping file, the mapping file selected to store the random storage locations based on the random storage locations being generated; encrypt the mapping file storing the random storage locations, the mapping file being encrypted as a result of receiving the random storage locations; and store the encrypted mapping file including the random storage locations.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the data transform, data storage and data modeling stages of the data pipeline are approved before the request to encrypt the data pipeline is received.
19. The system of claim 17, wherein the encrypted mapping file is stored in a vault.
20. The system of claim 17, wherein assembly instructions for the stages of the data pipeline are stored within the mapping file.
