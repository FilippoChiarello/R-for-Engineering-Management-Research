Needs-matching navigator system
</title>

<abstract>
A needs-matching navigator system and social network facilitator appurtenances including, for a large user plurality, software driven modules residing on electronic communications enabled platforms and devices. Beyond altruistically enhancing flourishing life horizons and life quality metrics, the modules facilitate (A) knowing respective user bias, profile, perspective, wellbeing orientation, and privacy preference; (B) understanding user needs description and wellbeing criteria; (C) finding answer and solutions to the needs by user biased projecting the description onto electronically stored knowledge-bases; (D) matching the user to the answers and solutions; and preferably (E) creating an instant electronic communications interactive community for the respective user, by inverse projecting large subsets of the answers and solutions back onto the large plurality of users; according to said users' profiles and needs descriptions. This navigable community may be classified into spontaneous castes; having various degrees of relevant understanding, expertise, experience, and/or curiosity about these answer and/or solution projections.

<claims>
1. A Matching Navigator System (MNS), said system including: a computerized system including a memory storing a user profile, said user profile including: a user-specific wellbeing criteria database, wherein said wellbeing criteria database includes a plurality of data elements representing predetermined wellbeing attributes, as well as data elements representing user-specific weightings for said predetermined wellbeing attributes, wherein said MNS monitors data from searches and site visits made using said MNS, compares said data from searches and site visits to said user-specific weighting for said wellbeing attributes, and adjusts said user-specific weighting for said wellbeing attributes based on said data from searches and site visits made using said MNS; a user-specific wellbeing orientation database, wherein said wellbeing orientation database includes a plurality of data elements representing predetermined wellbeing preference data and user-specific weightings for said predetermined wellbeing preference data, wherein said user-specific weightings for said predetermined wellbeing preference data are determined using an initial electronic survey presented to a user by said MNS for self-quantification by said user; and a user-specific understanding level data, wherein said MNS monitors data from searches and site visits made using said MNS, wherein said MNS determines a user-specific understanding level associated with said data from said searches and site visits and records said understanding level as said user-specific understanding level data; a solution database, stored in memory on a computerized system, wherein said solution database includes a solution data set corresponding to a predetermined potential user search query and a solution-specific electronic survey, wherein said solution data set includes a plurality of data elements representing predetermined solution attributes, wherein said data elements represent third-party quantified solution attributes that are quantified based on a plurality of third party user ratings collected from solution-specific electronic survey information received from a plurality of third parties in response to said solution-specific electronic survey, wherein said data elements representing third-party quantified solution attributes are determined by averaging said plurality of third party user ratings for said predetermined solution attributes; a computerized user interface, said computerized user interface receiving a search query from said user, wherein, when said search query from said user is determined by said MNS to correspond to said solution data set, said MNS retrieves said solution-specific electronic survey and transmits said solution-specific electronic survey to said computerized user interface for display to said user, wherein said computerized user interface receives user-specific weightings from said user for said solution attributes included in said solution-specific electronic survey; wherein said MNS: retrieves said plurality of data elements representing predetermined wellbeing attributes, as well as data elements representing user-specific weightings for said predetermined wellbeing attributes from said user-specific wellbeing criteria database; retrieves said plurality of data elements representing predetermined wellbeing preference data and said user-specific weightings for said predetermined wellbeing preference data from said user-specific wellbeing orientation database; and adjusts said user-specific weightings based on the data elements retrieved to determine user-specific adjusted weighting data for said solution attributes, wherein said MNS: generates a series of link selections based at least in part on matching said user-specific adjusted weighting data for said solution attributes with said data elements representing third-party quantified solution attributes, and said user-specific understanding level; and a Graphical Link Organizer (GLO) representing a user interface displaying a plurality of user-activatable links to organized search results, wherein said GLO includes: a first interface display area including links to search results that have been determined to be at the user-specific understanding level of said user based on said user-specific understanding level data; a second interface display area including links to search results that have been determined to be above the user-specific understanding level of said user based on said user-specific understanding level data; and a third interface display area including links to search results that have been determined to be below the user-specific understanding level of said user based on said user-specific understanding level data.
2. The system of claim 1 further including a fourth interface display area intersecting said first interface display area, said second interface display area, and said third interface display area, wherein said fourth interface display area displays links determined using said plurality of data elements representing predetermined wellbeing attributes, as well as data elements representing user-specific weightings for said predetermined wellbeing attributes.
3. The system of claim 1 wherein said MNS further monitors positional data received from a GPS system associated with said user and adjusts said user-specific weighting for said wellbeing attributes based on said positional data.
4. The system of claim 1 wherein said MNS further monitors physiological data received from a physiological data monitoring device associated with said user and adjusts said user-specific weighting for said wellbeing attributes based on said physiological data.
