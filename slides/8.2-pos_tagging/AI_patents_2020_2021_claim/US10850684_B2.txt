<title>
Vehicle secure messages based on a vehicle private key
</title>

<abstract>
An example apparatus comprises a processing resource coupled to a memory resource. The processing resource may be configured to execute instructions stored on the memory resource to generate a first secure key including a private key stored by a vehicle, generate a first secure message including the first secure key, transmit the first secure message over a vehicle bus to a vehicle part associated with the vehicle, and receive, from the vehicle part, a second secure message including at least one of a vehicle identification number (VIN) and a configuration parameter corresponding to the vehicle part in response to a determination that the first secure key matches a secure key corresponding to the vehicle part.

<claims>
1. An apparatus, comprising: a processing resource coupled to a memory resource, the processing resource to execute instructions stored on the memory resource to: generate a first secure key including a private key stored by an autonomous vehicle, wherein: the autonomous vehicle is to use secure data to perform one or more machine learning operations; and the private key is assigned to a replacement vehicle part to prevent unauthorized modification of the autonomous vehicle; update an anti-replay mechanism comprising at least one of a monotonic counter, a nonce value, a timestamp, or combinations thereof on power up of the vehicle; generate a first secure message including the first secure key; append a value associated with the anti-replay mechanism to the first secure message; transmit the first secure message over a vehicle bus to the replacement vehicle part associated with the autonomous vehicle and a control unit that includes a neural network to use the first secure message for the one or more machine learning operations; and receive, from the replacement vehicle part, a second secure message including at least one of a vehicle identification number (VIN) and a configuration parameter corresponding to the replacement vehicle part in response to a determination that the first secure key matches a secure key corresponding to the replacement vehicle part in order to facilitate a continual secure communication capability between the replacement vehicle part and the autonomous vehicle.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processing resource is to execute instructions stored on the memory resource to transmit the first secure message without transferring the private key over the vehicle bus.
3. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the processing resource is to execute instructions stored on the memory resource to encrypt the first secure message using a Message Authentication Code.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the private key is modifiable but not readable.
5. A method, comprising: generating a secure message comprising a vehicle identification number (VIN) associated with an autonomous vehicle and a private key associated with the autonomous vehicle, wherein the autonomous vehicle is configured to use the secure message to perform one or more machine learning operations; generating an anti-replay mechanism comprising at least one of a monotonic counter, a nonce value, a timestamp, or combinations thereof on power up of the vehicle; updating the anti-replay mechanism; appending a value associated with the anti-replay mechanism to the secure message; assigning the private key to a replacement vehicle part installed in the autonomous vehicle to prevent unauthorized modification of the autonomous vehicle; transmitting the secure message to at least one of a host computing device and the replacement vehicle part associated with a control unit that includes a neural network to use the secure message for the machine learning; decrypting the secure message using a key generated by at least one of the host computing device and the replacement vehicle part in order to facilitate a continual secure communication capability between the replacement vehicle part and the autonomous vehicle; and taking an action responsive to decrypting the secure message.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein generating the secure message further comprises generating the secure message with a serial number corresponding to an electronic control unit (ECU) associated with the vehicle and a typology corresponding to the ECU.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein taking the action includes updating firmware associated with the vehicle.
8. The method of claim 5, wherein taking the action includes determining that the vehicle part is authentic.
9. The method of claim 5, wherein generating the secure message further comprises encrypting the secure message using a message authentication code.
10. The method of claim 5, further comprising transmitting the secure message to at least one of the host computing device and the vehicle part without exposing the private key to a bus associated with the vehicle.
11. An apparatus, comprising: a control unit that includes a neural network to use secure data for one or more machine learning operations; and a processing resource coupled to a memory resource, the processing resource to execute instructions stored on the memory resource to: update an anti-replay mechanism comprising at least one of a monotonic counter, a nonce value, a timestamp, or combinations thereof on power up of the autonomous vehicle; and generate a first secure key including a private key stored by an autonomous vehicle, wherein: the autonomous vehicle is to use the secure data to perform the one or more machine learning operations; and the private key is assigned to a replacement vehicle part installed in the autonomous vehicle to prevent unauthorized modification of the autonomous vehicle; generate a first secure message including the first secure key; append a value associated with the anti-replay mechanism to the first secure message; transmit the first secure message over a vehicle bus to the replacement vehicle part; and receive, from the replacement vehicle part, a second secure message including at least one of a vehicle identification number (VIN) and a configuration parameter corresponding to the replacement vehicle part in response to a determination that the first secure key matches a secure key corresponding to the replacement vehicle part in order to facilitate a continual secure communication capability between the replacement vehicle part and the autonomous vehicle.
