<title>
Unified indexing framework for reference signals
</title>

<abstract>
Facilitating a signaling framework for configuring different types of reference signals for wireless communication systems is provided herein. A system can comprise: a processor; and a memory that stores executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, facilitate performance of operations. The operations can comprise: receiving a reference signal from a user equipment device; based on the reference signal generating a unique identifier from the reference signal; allocating a resource associated with the reference signal based on a reference signal type and a component carrier index list; associating the unique identifier with the resource, the component carrier index list, and the reference signal type in a data structure; and storing the data structure to the memory and transmitting the data structure to the user equipment device.

<claims>
1. A system, comprising: a processor; and a memory that stores executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: allocating a reference signal resource with a reference signal type and a group of index data representative of a component carrier; and facilitating a mobile device to measure a reference signal of the reference signal type, wherein the reference signal is associated with a unique identifier associated with the reference signal resource, and wherein the unique identifier is generated based on a system identifier associated with the system, the reference signal type, and a mobile device identifier associated with the mobile device.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise adapting the reference signal resource for use by the mobile device.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise transmitting the reference signal to the mobile device.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the facilitating the mobile device to measure the reference signal comprises facilitating the mobile device to use a quasi-colocation assumption as input to measurement of the reference signal.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise facilitating the mobile device to use a reference symbol received power measurement value for beam management.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise facilitating the mobile device to use a reference symbol received power measurement value for mobility management.
7. A method, comprising: facilitating, by a system comprising a processor, allocating a reference signal resource with a reference signal type and index data representing a component carrier, wherein the reference signal resource is associated with a unique identifier and the unique identifier is determined as a function of a processor identifier associated with the processor, a reference signal type, and a portable device identifier associated with a portable device; and facilitating, by the system, transmitting a reference signal of the reference signal type to the portable device.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising configuring, by the system, the reference signal resource for use by the portable device.
9. The method of claim 7, further comprising facilitating, by the system, the portable device to measure the reference signal associated with the unique identifier.
10. The method of claim 7, further comprising facilitating, by the system, the portable device to use a quasi-colocation assumption for measurement of the reference signal.
11. The method of claim 7, further comprising facilitating, by the system, the portable device to use a received power measurement value for beam management.
12. The method of claim 7, further comprising facilitating, by the system, the portable device to use a received power measurement value for mobility management.
13. The method of claim 7, wherein the reference signal resource comprises a channel state information reference signal.
14. The method of claim 7, wherein the reference signal resource comprises a phase-tracking reference signal.
15. The method of claim 7, wherein the reference signal resource comprises a demodulation reference signal in an uplink transmission.
16. The method of claim 7, wherein the reference signal resource comprises a demodulation reference signal in a downlink transmission.
17. A machine-readable storage medium, comprising executable instructions that, when executed by a processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: allocating a reference signal resource with a type of a reference signal and a list of index data representative of a component carrier, transmitting the reference signal to a device; and facilitating the device to measure the reference signal associated with a unique identifier, wherein the unique identifier is associated with the reference signal resource, and wherein the unique identifier is determined based on a processor identifier associated with the processor, the type of the reference signal, and a device identifier associated with the device.
18. The machine-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein the operations further comprise facilitating the device to use a reference symbol received power measurement value for beam management.
19. The machine-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein the facilitating the device to measure the reference signal comprises facilitating the device to use a quasi-colocation assumption.
20. The machine-readable storage medium of claim 17, wherein the operations further comprise facilitating the device to use a reference symbol received power measurement value for mobility management.
