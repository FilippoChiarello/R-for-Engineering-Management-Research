COMMUNICATION DEMODULATION IN WIRELESS CHARGING SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A wireless charging system is configured to charge one or more receiver devices simultaneously. The wireless charging system includes multiple coils that may be driven independently based on a feedback system with one or more feedback channels. One of the feedback channels may be demodulated communication signals from the one or more receiver devices. The demodulation may be performed by a communication demodulation circuit with configurable gain. The demodulated communication signals are processed for error correction at a bit level and a packet level, which improves accuracy despite presence of multiple receiver devices and noisy conditions.
