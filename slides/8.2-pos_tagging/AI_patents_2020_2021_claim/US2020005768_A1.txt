METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RECOGNIZING A VOICE
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are a speech recognition method and a speech recognition device, in which speech recognition is performed by executing an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm and/or a machine learning algorithm provided therein. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the speech recognition method includes buffering an inputted spoken utterance, determining whether a preset wake-up word is present in the spoken utterance by comparing the buffered spoken utterance to the preset wake-up word, and in response to the preset wake-up word in the spoken utterance, activating a speech recognition function and isolating, from the spoken utterance, a spoken sentence as a voice command without the wake-up word, and processing the spoken sentence and outputting a processing result.

<claims>
1. A speech recognition method by a speech recognition device, the speech recognition method comprising: buffering an inputted spoken utterance; comparing the buffered spoken utterance to a preset wake-up word to determine whether the preset wake-up word is present in the spoken utterance; in response to the preset wake-up word present in the spoken utterance, activating a speech recognition function and isolating, from the spoken utterance, a spoken sentence as a voice command without the wake-up word; and processing the spoken sentence and outputting a processing result.
2. The speech recognition method of claim 1, wherein the buffering further includes buffering by varying a buffering volume or time in accordance with an environment condition under which the spoken utterance is inputted.
3. The speech recognition method of claim 1, wherein the isolating includes isolating, from the spoken utterance, the spoken sentence preceding the wake-up word.
4. The speech recognition method of claim 1, wherein the isolating includes isolating, from the spoken utterance, a first spoken segment and a second spoken segment without the wake-up word, wherein the first spoken segment precedes the wake-up word, the second spoken segment follows the wake-up word, and the wake-up word is positioned within the spoken sentence.
5. The speech recognition method of claim 4, wherein the outputting includes outputting the processing result of a single voice command, wherein the single voice command is formed by combining the first spoken segment preceding the wake-up word and the second spoken segment following the wake-up word.
6. The speech recognition method of claim 1, wherein the isolating includes isolating, from the spoken utterance including two or more spoken sentences, the two or more spoken sentences without the wake-up word positioned between the two or more spoken sentences.
7. The speech recognition method of claim 6, wherein the outputting includes outputting a result of sequentially processing the two or more spoken sentences.
8. The speech recognition method of claim 6, wherein the outputting includes outputting, at once, a result of batch processing the two or more spoken sentences.
9. A computer program stored in a recording medium readable by a computer to permit the speech recognition method of claim 1 to be executed using the computer.
10. A speech recognition device configured to recognize an inputted spoken utterance, the speech recognition device comprising: a buffer configured to buffer the inputted spoken utterance; a determiner configured to determine whether a preset wake-up word is present in the spoken utterance by comparing the spoken utterance buffered by the buffer to the preset wake-up word; an isolator configured to activate a speech recognition function in response to the preset wake-up word present in the spoken utterance, and to isolate from the spoken utterance a spoken sentence as a voice command without the preset wake-up word; and a controller configured to control to cause the spoken sentence to be processed and a processing result to be outputted.
11. The speech recognition device of claim 10, further comprising a variator configured to vary a buffering volume or time of the buffer in accordance with an environment condition under which the spoken utterance is inputted.
12. The speech recognition device of claim 10, wherein the isolator is configured to isolate, from the spoken utterance, the spoken sentence positioned before the wake-up word.
13. The speech recognition device of claim 10, wherein the isolator is configured to isolate, from the spoken utterance, a first spoken segment and a second spoken segment without the wake-up word positioned within the spoken sentence, the first spoken segment preceding the wake-up word, and the second spoken segment following the wake-up word.
14. The speech recognition device of claim 13, wherein the controller is configured to control a processing result of a single voice command to be outputted, the single voice command being formed by combining the first spoken segment and the second spoken segment.
15. The speech recognition device of claim 10, wherein the isolator is configured to isolate, from the spoken utterance including two or more spoken sentences, the two or more spoken sentences without the wake-up word positioned between the two or more spoken sentences.
16. The speech recognition device of claim 15, wherein the controller controls to cause a result of sequentially processing the two or more spoken sentences to be sequentially outputted.
17. The speech recognition device of claim 15, wherein the controller controls to cause a result of batch processing the two or more spoken sentences to be outputted at once.
