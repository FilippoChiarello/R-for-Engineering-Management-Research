Apparatuses and methods for audio classifying and processing
</title>

<abstract>
Apparatus and methods for audio classifying and processing are disclosed. In one embodiment, an audio processing apparatus includes an audio classifier for classifying an audio signal into at least one audio type in real time; an audio improving device for improving experience of audience; and an adjusting unit for adjusting at least one parameter of the audio improving device in a continuous manner based on the confidence value of the at least one audio type.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An audio processing apparatus comprising: an audio classifier configured to repeatedly classify an audio signal in real time as one or more of a plurality of audio types, each classification having a confidence value associated therewith; an audio improving device configured to modify one or more characteristics of the audio signal based on adjustable parameters of the audio improving device; and an adjusting unit configured to continuously adjust at least one of the adjustable parameters of the audio improving device based on the confidence values associated with the repeated classification of the audio signal, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to derive adjustments to the at least one of the adjustable parameters using weights derived from the confidence values as input to the adjusting unit in calculating the adjustments, and wherein the adjusting unit is configured to positively correlate the adjustments with the confidence values for a first audio type, and to negatively correlate the adjustments with the confidence values for a second audio type.
2. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the plurality of audio types comprises a context type of VoIP or non-VoIP, and one or more of content types of short-term music, speech, background sound, and noise, and wherein the short-term music comprises music without dominant sources or music with dominant sources.
3. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the short-term music comprises at least one genre-based cluster or at least one instrument-based cluster or at least one music cluster classified based on rhythm, tempo, timbre of music and/or any other musical attributes.
4. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 1, where the audio improving device comprises at least one selected from a dialog enhancer, a surround virtualizer, a volume leveler and an equalizer.
5. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the audio improving device comprises at least one selected from a dialog enhancer, a surround virtualizer, a volume leveler and an equalizer.
6. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the audio improving device comprises a dialog enhancer, and wherein the adjusting unit is configured to positively correlate a level of dialog enhancement of the dialog enhancer with the confidence values for movie-like media and/or VoIP, and/or negatively correlate the level of dialog enhancement of the dialog enhancer with the confidence values for the long-term music and/or game.
7. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the audio improving device comprises a dialog enhancer, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to positively correlate a level of dialog enhancement of the dialog enhancer with the confidence values for speech.
8. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the audio improving device comprises a dialog enhancer for enhancing frequency bands above respective thresholds, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to positively correlate the thresholds with the confidence values for short-term music and/or noise and/or background sounds, and/or negatively correlate the thresholds with the confidence values for speech.
9. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the audio improving device comprises a minimum tracking unit for estimating a background level of the audio signal, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to assign an adjustment to the background level estimated by the minimum tracking unit, wherein the adjusting unit is further configured to positively correlate the adjustment with the confidence values for short-term music and/or noise and/or background sound, and/or negatively correlate the adjustment with the confidence values for speech.
10. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 9, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to correlate the adjustment with the confidence values for noise and/or background sound more positively than with the confidence values for short-term music.
11. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the audio improving device comprises a surround virtualizer, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to positively correlate a surround boost amount of the surround virtualizer with the confidence values for noise and/or background sound and/or speech, and/or negatively correlate the surround boost amount with the confidence values for short-term music.
12. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 11, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to correlate the surround boost amount with the confidence values for noise and/or background sound more positively than with the confidence values for content type speech.
13. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the audio improving device comprises a surround virtualizer, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to positively correlate a start frequency of the surround virtualizer with the confidence values for short-term music.
14. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the audio improving device comprises a surround virtualizer, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to positively correlate a surround boost amount of the surround virtualizer with the confidence values for movie-like media and/or game, and/or negatively correlate the surround boost amount with the confidence values for long-term music and/or VoIP.
15. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 14, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to correlate the surround boost amount with the confidence values for movie-like media more positively than with the confidence values for game.
16. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to adjust the at least one of the adjustable parameters based on the confidence values for at least one content type and the confidence values for at least one context type.
17. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 16, wherein the confidence values for the content type of the audio signal are weighted based on the context type of the audio signal.
18. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to weight the confidence values for each audio type based on an importance of each audio type.
19. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to weight each audio type based on the corresponding confidence values.
20. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to derive the adjustments in a manner that mitigates abrupt changes in classification of the audio signal by one or more of (1) smoothing the confidence values, (2) smoothing the adjustable parameters, or (3) delaying use of the adjustments.
21. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 20, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to smooth the confidence values based on a weighted sum of two or more consecutive confidence values.
22. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 20, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to smooth the adjustable parameters based on a weighted sum of two or more consecutive values of a particular adjustable parameter.
23. The audio processing apparatus according to claim 20, wherein the adjusting unit is configured to delay use of the adjustments based on monitoring of the audio classifier to confirm a change in a particular classification of the audio signal.
