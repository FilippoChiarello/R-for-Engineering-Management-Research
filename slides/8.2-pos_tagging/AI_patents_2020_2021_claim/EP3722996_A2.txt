SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PROCESSING 3D ANATOMICAL VOLUMES BASED ON LOCALIZATION OF 2D SLICES THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided a computer implemented method for localizing target anatomical regions of interest (ROI) of a target individual, comprising: uniformly subsampling (306) a plurality of 2D images having sequential index numbers within a 3D anatomical volume, feeding (308) the plurality of sampled 2D images into a classifier for outputting a plurality of values on a normalized anatomical scale, fitting (310) a linear model to the plurality of values and corresponding sequential index numbers, mapping (316) by the linear model, the plurality of 2D images to the normalized anatomical scale, receiving (318) an indication of at least one target anatomical ROI of a target individual, wherein each target anatomical ROI is mapped to the normalized anatomical scale, and providing (320) a sub-set of the plurality of 2D images having values of the normalized anatomical scale corresponding to the received at least one target anatomical ROI.

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method for localizing target anatomical regions of interest (ROI) of a target individual, comprising: uniformly sub-sampling (306) a plurality of 2D images having sequential index numbers within a 3D anatomical volume; feeding (308) the plurality of sampled 2D images into a classifier for outputting a plurality of values on a normalized anatomical scale; fitting (310) a linear model to the plurality of values and corresponding sequential index numbers; mapping (316) by the linear model, the plurality of 2D images to the normalized anatomical scale; receiving (318) an indication of at least one target anatomical ROI of a target individual, wherein each target anatomical ROI is mapped to the normalized anatomical scale; and providing (320) a sub-set of the plurality of 2D images having values of the normalized anatomical scale corresponding to the received at least one target anatomical ROI.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising executing a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) designed for analysis of a certain target anatomical ROI application, on the respective sub-set of the plurality of 2D images having values corresponding to the certain target anatomical ROI.
3. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the normalized anatomical scale comprises a one dimensional coordinate system of a plurality of equally spaced positions along an axial dimension of an arbitrary human body.
4. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the classifier classifies each of the plurality of sampled 2D images into at least one classification category of a plurality of classification categories, wherein the plurality of classification categories correspond to a number of equally spaced values along the normalized anatomical scale.
5. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the classifier computes a mapping confidence score indicative of confidence of the mapping between an inputted 2D image and the computed value, and rejecting the computed value when the mapping confidence score is according to a rejection requirement.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the rejection requirement comprises a plurality of peak probability vectors for a single 2D image.
7. The method of claim 5 or claim 6, wherein the 2D image is retained when the mapping confidence score comprises a single and narrow probability vector.
8. The method of any preceding claim, wherein original pixel values of each of the sampled 2D images are inputted into the classifier.
9. The method of any preceding claim, wherein a total number of the plurality of 2D images is about 100-2000, wherein the uniformed sub-sampling is performed by selecting one 2D image for every about 10-50 sequential 2D images, and wherein a number of the sampled 2D images is about 20-50.
10. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the normalized anatomical scale is a continuous range of values ranging from 0 to 99, wherein a normalized position of a tip of a head is set to 0 and a lowest part of feet is set to 99.
11. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the 3D anatomical volume is a CT scan and the plurality of 2D images are axial slices of the CT scan.
12. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the plurality of 2D images are mapped to respective values of the normalized anatomical scale independently of DICOMÂ® metadata associated with the 3D anatomical volume.
13. The method of any preceding claim, wherein the classifier is trained according to a training dataset of 3D anatomical volumes of a plurality of sample patients, where a plurality of 2D images of each 3D anatomical volume are labeled with value on a normalized anatomical scale computed by a process of: labeling each of a superior 2D image and an inferior 2D image with a value corresponding to a respective depicted defined anatomical landmark, labeling 2D images between the superior 2D image and the inferior 2D image with values computed by a linear interpolation of the values of the superior 2D image and inferior 2D image.
14. The method of any preceding claim, further comprising computing a fitting score for the fit of the linear model to the plurality of values and corresponding sequential index number of the respective sampled 2D image, wherein a fitting score requirement of the fitting score defines an error in the computation of the values, and rejecting the 3D anatomical volume when the fitting score meets a rejection requirement.
15. The method of any preceding claim, further comprising evaluating the 3D anatomical volume for exclusion from further processing when a set of rules defining unreliable results is met, the set of rules based on a fitting score computed for the linear model and on probability vectors computed by the classifier for the sampled subset of 2D images.
