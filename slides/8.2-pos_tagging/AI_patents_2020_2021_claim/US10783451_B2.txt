<title>
Ensemble machine learning for structured and unstructured data
</title>

<abstract>
A machine learning system includes a data set processing subsystem to store data objects from multiple sources. An ensemble machine learning subsystem and a data search function may execute queries and identify related structured and unstructured data from the stored data objects. The structured and unstructured data may be used to create new data objects.
