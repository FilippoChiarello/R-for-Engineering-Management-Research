<title>
Facilitation of dynamic edge computations for 6G or other next generation network
</title>

<abstract>
Peripheral devices such as wearables can link to mobile devices to access network elements. These peripheral devices can comprise a communication part and a processing part. Each of these parts, specially the processing part of the next item in a communication chain, can be multiple times larger and stronger than the previous linked item. For instance, the peripheral device can be connected to the mobile device which can be in line connected to an NodeB device. Because the processing power of mobile device can be several times stronger than the peripheral, a mobile edge computing platform and a multi-access application function facilitate sharing of processing power capabilities between the peripheral devices, mobile devices, and/or the NodeB devices.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: receiving, by a first wireless network device comprising a processor from a mobile device, request data representative of a request for a processing resource; in response to the receiving the request data, transmitting, by the wireless network device, the request data to a second wireless network device to fulfill the request for the processing resource; in response to the transmitting the request data, receiving, by the first wireless network device, the processing resource; and in response to the receiving the processing resource, transmitting, by the first wireless network device, the processing resource to the mobile device.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the receiving the request data representative of the request for the processing resource is in response to the mobile device initiating a mobile application.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the second wireless network device is a server device.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the request data is received via a control message sent from the mobile device.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the processing resource is additional power to be added to a processing capability of the mobile device.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the mobile device is a first mobile device, and wherein the second wireless network access is a second mobile device.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: in response to the receiving request data, generating, by the first wireless network device, requirement data representative of an amount of the processing resource to be allocated to the mobile device.
8. A system, comprising: a processor; and a memory that stores executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: receiving control message data representative of a control message indicating that a mobile device is initiating a process; in response to the receiving the control message data, transmitting the control message data to a wireless network device, of wireless network devices, to fulfill a request for a processing capability applicable to the process; in response to the transmitting the control message data, receiving the processing capability; and in response to the receiving the processing capability facilitating performance of the process for the mobile device.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the processing capability is an increase in power to perform the process.
10. The system of claim 8, wherein the operations further comprise: transmitting the control message data to the wireless network devices.
11. The system of claim 10 wherein the operations further comprise: in response to the transmitting the control message data to the wireless network devices, receiving processing capabilities from the wireless network devices.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the operations further comprise: in response to the receiving the processing capabilities from the wireless network devices, aggregating the capabilities from the wireless network devices to fulfill the request for the processing capability.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the processing capability is received from a server device of the wireless networking devices.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the control message data is sent to a virtual machine device associated with the server device.
15. A machine-readable medium, comprising executable instructions that, when executed by a processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: receiving control message data representative of a control message indicating that a mobile device is initiating a process; in response to the receiving the control message data, transmitting the control message data to a wireless network device, of a wireless network, to fulfill a request for a processing capability for the process; in response to the transmitting the control message data, receiving the processing capability; and in response to the receiving the processing capability, facilitating performance of the process for the mobile device.
16. The machine-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the processing capability is a processing speed.
17. The machine-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the processing capability comprises processing speed functionalities from wireless networking devices of the wireless network.
18. The machine-readable medium of claim 17, wherein the operations further comprise: aggregating the processing speed functionalities to fulfill the request for the processing capability.
19. The machine-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the initiating the process is associated with a subscriber application of the mobile device.
20. The machine-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the process is performed in response to the request for the processing capability being fulfilled.
