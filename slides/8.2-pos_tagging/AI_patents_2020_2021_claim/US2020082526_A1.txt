METHODS OF CLASSIFYING AND/OR DETERMINING ORIENTATIONS OF OBJECTS USING TWO-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES
</title>

<abstract>
Methods for classifying and measuring orientations of objects, as nonlimiting examples, implants utilizing two-dimensional radiographs. One such method determines a three-dimensional orientation of an object based on its area projected onto a two-dimensional image and known or measured geometry. Another such method provides an automated solution to computationally determine the orientation and characterizing features of an implant based on two-dimensional radiographs. Orientations and characteristics of one or more objects in the vicinity of an object of interest may also be determined.

<claims>
1. A method of determining a three-dimensional orientation of an object and optionally other characteristics of the object based on its area projected onto a two-dimensional image and known or measured geometry.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the other characteristics of the object comprise one or more of make, model, and material of the object based on the area thereof projected onto the two-dimensional image and the known or measured geometry and radiographic opacity thereof.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining a three-dimensional orientation of the object relative to a second object in the vicinity of the object in the two-dimensional image.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the object is a first object that is partially obscured by a second object, the method comprising: measuring a combined two-dimensional area of the first and second objects as displayed in the two-dimensional image; and using the combined two-dimensional area to determine the three-dimensional orientation of the first object by accounting for a measured or estimated two-dimensional area of overlap between the first and second objects, a measured or estimated two-dimensional area of the first object, and a measured or estimated two-dimensional area of the second object, wherein the two-dimensional area of overlap is estimated with known areas and measurements of the first and second objects and measured, known, or assumed orientations of the first and second objects, and wherein optionally the first and second objects have known or measured geometries and shapes and the two-dimensional areas of the first and second objects are estimated.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the method uses artificial intelligence to determine the three-dimensional orientation of the object.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the method uses deep learning to determine the three-dimensional orientation of the object.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the method uses a convolutional neural network to determine the three-dimensional orientation of the object.
8. A method of determining the three-dimensional orientation of a first object that is partially obscured by a second object based on a two-dimensional image of the first and second objects, the method comprising: measuring a combined area of the first and second objects as displayed in the image; determining a two-dimensional area of overlap between the first and second object by adding known actual areas of the first and second objects and subtracting therefrom the combined area measured in the image; and determining the orientation of the first object based on the two-dimensional area of overlap between the first and second objects.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the first object is a first prosthetic component.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the second object is a second prosthetic component.
11. The method of claim 8, wherein the first and second components are an acetabular cup and a femoral head of a hip prosthesis.
12. The method of claim 8, wherein the image is a radiographic image.
13. The method of claim 8, further comprising determining other characteristics of the first object based on its area projected onto the two-dimensional image and the known or measured geometry thereof.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the other characteristics of the first object comprise one or more of make, model, and material of the first object based on the area thereof projected onto the two-dimensional image and the known or measured geometry and radiographic opacity thereof.
15. The method of claim 13, further comprising determining the orientation and characteristics of a second object in the vicinity of the first object in the two-dimensional image and determining therefrom a relative orientation of the first object to the second object.
16. A method of determining the three-dimensional orientation of an acetabular cup of a hip prosthesis that is partially obscured by a femoral head of the hip prosthesis based on a two-dimensional radiographic image of the acetabular cup and the femoral head after the hip prosthesis has been implanted in a subject, the method comprising: measuring a first dimension equal to a diameter of the acetabular cup; measuring a second dimension equal to a maximum distance between a posterolateral edge of an opening of the acetabular cup and a point on an exterior surface of the acetabular cup along an axis thereof; and determining the orientation of the acetabular cup based on the measured first and second dimensions.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein determining the orientation of the acetabular cup is based on the following equation: where D2 and D3 are the first and second dimensions, respectively.
18. The method of claim 16, further comprising determining other characteristics of the hip prosthesis based on its area projected onto the two-dimensional image and the known or measured geometry thereof.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the other characteristics of the hip prosthesis comprise one or more of make, model, and material of the hip prosthesis based on the area thereof projected onto the two-dimensional image and the known or measured geometry and radiographic opacity thereof.
20. The method of claim 18, further comprising determining the orientation and characteristics of a structure or tissue in the vicinity of the hip prosthesis and visible in the two-dimensional image and determining therefrom a relative orientation of the first object to the structure or tissue.
