<title>
Method and system for exploring the associations between drug side-effects and therapeutic indications
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for analyzing chemical data including a processor and one or more classifiers, stored in memory and coupled to the processor, which further includes an indication predictive module configured to predict whether a given chemical treats a particular indication or not and a side effect predictive module configured to predict whether a given chemical causes a side-effect or not. A correlation engine is configured to determine one or more correlations between one or more indications and one or more side effects for the given chemical and a visualization tool is configured to analyze the one or more correlations and to output results of the analysis.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for analyzing chemical data, comprising: classifying a given chemical, using one or more classifiers stored in memory and coupled to a processor, wherein the classifying further comprises: constructing a keyword dataset from a plurality of side-effect database sources; predicting whether the given chemical treats one or more indications or not based on clinical side-effect keywords from the keyword dataset and other chemical properties of the given chemical; and predicting whether the given chemical causes one or more side effects or not; determining one or more correlations between the one or more indications and the one or more side effects for the given chemical; and analyzing the one or more correlations and outputting results of the analyzing using a visualization tool.
2. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 1, wherein features used for predicting whether the given chemical causes the one or more side-effects include the chemical's known uses and other chemical properties of the given chemical.
3. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 1, further comprising applying a statistical significance test to build correlated disease-side-effect associations from predicted chemical-disease and chemical-side-effect associations.
4. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 1, further comprising clustering the predicted indications and side effects for the chemical within a selected threshold of correlation, wherein the selected threshold of correlation is variable.
5. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 1, further comprising tuning a threshold of association strength above which at least one of drug-disease or drug-side-effect associations will be shown in the visualization tool, and investigating the associations at different granularities using a zoom-in/zoom-out function.
6. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 1, further comprising representing disease-side-effect associations configured to show bi-cliques formed by the associations while tuning a threshold of association strength using a network-based dynamic layout strategy.
7. The computer-implemented method as recited in claim 1, wherein the predicting of the indications and the side effects includes predictions related to one or more chemicals interacting with one or more environmental ecosystems.
