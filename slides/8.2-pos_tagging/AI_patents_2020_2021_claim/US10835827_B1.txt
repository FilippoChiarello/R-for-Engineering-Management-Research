<title>
Initiating real-time games in video communications
</title>

<abstract>
In one embodiment, a method includes, by a client system of a first user, receiving an input to initiate a first game within a first layer of a communication interface, wherein the communication interface comprises one or more layers containing a live video communication between the first user and a second user, wherein the first layer comprises a video communication of the second user; executing a gaming protocol associated with the first game; generating a game container in a second layer of the communication interface to contain the first game in a full-screen view of the communication interface; reducing the first layer containing the video communication of the second user to a thumbnail within the communication interface; and overlaying, by the client system, the first layer onto the second layer based on one or more parameters set by the gaming protocol.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method comprising, by a client system of a first user: presenting, by the client system, a communication interface comprising a plurality of layers containing a live video communication between the first user and a second user, wherein a first layer of the communication interface comprises a video communication of the second user, wherein a second layer of the communication interface comprises a thumbnail view of a video communication of the first user, and wherein the communication interface comprises an activatable element to access a first game; receiving, by the client system, an input to initiate the first game within the first layer of a communication interface via a selection of the activatable element; executing, by the client system, a gaming protocol associated with the first game, wherein the gaming protocol comprises instructions for coordinating in-game actions between the first and second users via application programming interface (API) calls to a gaming server; generating, by the client system, a game container in a third layer of the communication interface, wherein the third layer contains the first game in a full-screen view of the communication interface; reducing, by the client system, the first layer containing the video communication of the second user to a thumbnail within the communication interface; and overlaying, by the client system, the first layer onto the third layer based on one or more parameters set by the gaming protocol, wherein the second layer is closed responsive to the overlaying of the first layer onto the third layer.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein receiving the input to initiate the first game comprises: receiving, by the client system, an indication the first user has selected the activatable element to access a games tab; presenting, by the client system, a fourth layer containing the games tab, wherein the games tab comprises a list of one or more games accessible via the communication interface; and receiving, by the client system, an indication the first user has selected the first game from the list.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein executing the gaming protocol comprises: sending, by the client system, a request via the gaming server to the second user to execute the gaming protocol associated with the first game; and receiving, by the client system, a confirmation via the gaming server that the second user has executed the gaming protocol associated with the first game.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the gaming protocol comprises settings for configuring the first game within the communication interface.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the first user and the second user have corresponding user profiles comprising one or more of gaming-moment information or user preferences.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein executing the gaming protocol comprises matching the first user and the second user to play the first game.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein executing the gaming protocol further comprises comparing one or more user preferences in the user profiles of the first and second users.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving, by the client system, an input to adjust one or more of a position or size of the thumbnail video communication of the second user.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the first game includes one or more game elements, and wherein the thumbnail within the first layer is overlaid to avoid overlaying onto the one or more game elements.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the live video communication between the first user and the second user is initially in a full-screen view, and wherein the first layer is reduced from the full-screen view to the thumbnail within the communication interface.
11. One or more computer-readable non-transitory storage media embodying software that is operable when executed by a client system to: present a communication interface comprising a plurality of layers containing a live video communication between the first user and a second user, wherein a first layer of the communication interface comprises a video communication of the second user, wherein a second layer of the communication interface comprises a thumbnail view of a video communication of the first user, and wherein the communication interface comprises an activatable element to access a first game; receive an input to initiate the first game within the first layer of a communication interface via a selection of the activatable element; execute a gaming protocol associated with the first game, wherein the gaming protocol comprises instructions for coordinating in-game actions between the first and second users via application programming interface (API) calls to a gaming server; generate a game container in a third layer of the communication interface, wherein the third layer contains the first game in a full-screen view of the communication interface; reduce the first layer containing the video communication of the second user to a thumbnail within the communication interface; and overlay the first layer onto the third layer based on one or more parameters set by the gaming protocol, wherein the second layer is closed responsive to the overlaying of the first layer onto the third layer.
12. A client system comprising: one or more processors; and a non-transitory memory coupled to the processors comprising instructions executable by the processors, the processors operable when executing the instructions to: present a communication interface comprising a plurality of layers containing a live video communication between the first user and a second user, wherein a first layer of the communication interface comprises a video communication of the second user, wherein a second layer of the communication interface comprises a thumbnail view of a video communication of the first user, and wherein the communication interface comprises an activatable element to access a first game; receive an input to initiate the first game within the first layer of a communication interface via a selection of the activatable element; execute a gaming protocol associated with the first game, wherein the gaming protocol comprises instructions for coordinating in-game actions between the first and second users via application programming interface (API) calls to a gaming server; generate a game container in a second layer of the communication interface, wherein the second layer contains the first game in a full-screen view of the communication interface; reduce the first layer containing the video communication of the second user to a thumbnail within the communication interface; and overlay the first layer onto the second layer based on one or more parameters set by the gaming protocol.
