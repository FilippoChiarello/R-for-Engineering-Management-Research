<title>
DNA METHYLATION BIOMARKERS FOR BLADDER CANCER
</title>

<abstract>
A method for the prediction, prognosis and/or diagnosis of bladder cancer or bladder cancer recurrence in a subject, the method includes: providing a test sample from the subject; measuring DNA methylation levels of at least a portion of two or more polynucleotides selected from the group consisting of HOXA9, SOX1, NPY, IRAK3, L1-MET, and ZO2 in the test sample; calculating a risk score based on the measured DNA methylation levels, comparing the calculated risk score to a cut-off value derived from a reference DNA methylation profile based on DNA methylation levels of the one or more biomarkers derived from a control group, members of which had bladder cancer; and based on the comparison calculated risk score to the cut-off value, determining at least one of: (1) whether bladder cancer has recurred; (2) whether there is likelihood that the bladder cancer will recur; and (3) whether the patient has bladder cancer. The one or more polynucleotides preferably comprise SOX1, IRAK3 and L1-MET.

<claims>
1. A method for the prediction, prognosis and/or diagnosis of bladder cancer or bladder cancer recurrence in a subject, the method comprising: providing a test sample from the subject; measuring a DNA methylation level of at least a portion of one or more polynucleotides selected from the group consisting of HOXA9, SOX1, NPY, IRAK3, L1-MET, and ZO2 in the test sample; comparing the DNA methylation level of the one or more polynucleotides in the test sample to a reference DNA methylation profile based on the DNA methylation levels of the one or more polynucleotides in a control group, members of which had bladder cancer; and based on the comparison, determining at least one of: (1) whether bladder cancer has recurred; (2) whether there is likelihood that the bladder cancer will recur; and (3) whether the patient has bladder cancer.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the test sample is urine or blood.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more polynucleotide is HOXA9.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more polynucleotides includes at least one hypomethylated polynucleotide and at least one hypermethylated polynucleotide.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more polynucleotides comprise SOX1, IRAK3 and L1-MET.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more polynucleotides consist of SOX1, IRAK3 and L1-MET.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: extracting DNA from the test sample, bisulfite conversion, and PCR amplification.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein DNA Methylation Levels is a percentage of methylated cytosines, defined as a number of methylated cytosines divided by the sum of methylated and unmethylated cytosines.
9. A system comprising: a non-transitory computer readable medium comprising a computer readable program code stored thereon for causing a processor to obtain the measured DNA methylation levels of one or more of HOXA9, SOX1, NPY, IRAK3, L1-Met, and ZO2 in the test sample; compare the DNA methylation levels of the one or more biomarkers in the test sample to a reference DNA methylation profile of the one or more biomarkers derived from a control group, members of which had bladder cancer.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein a report is generated based on the comparison providing guidance as to one of: (1) whether bladder cancer has recurred; (2) whether there is risk that the bladder cancer will recur; and (3) whether the patient has bladder cancer.
11. A system comprising: a non-transitory computer readable medium comprising computer readable program code stored thereon for causing a processor to obtain the measured DNA methylation levels of two or more of HOXA9, SOX1, NPY, IRAK3, L1-Met, and ZO2 in the test sample; calculate a risk score; and compare the risk score to a cutoff value derived from a reference DNA methylation profile based on DNA methylation levels of the one or more biomarkers derived from a control group, members of which had bladder cancer.
12. The system of claim 11, further comprising: a report providing guidance based on the risk score as to one of: (1) whether bladder cancer has recurred; (2) whether there is risk that the bladder cancer will recur; and (3) whether the patient has bladder cancer.
