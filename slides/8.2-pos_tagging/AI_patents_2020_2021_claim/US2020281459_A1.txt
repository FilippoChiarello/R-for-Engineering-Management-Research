CENTRAL SUPERVISION STATION SYSTEM FOR PROGRESSIVE LENS SIMULATORS
</title>

<abstract>
A Progressive Lens Simulator comprises an Eye Tracker, for tracking an eye axis direction to determine a gaze distance, an Off-Axis Progressive Lens Simulator, for generating an Off-Axis progressive lens simulation; and an Axial Power-Distance Simulator, for simulating a progressive lens power in the eye axis direction. The Progressive Lens Simulator can alternatively include an Integrated Progressive Lens Simulator, for creating a Comprehensive Progressive Lens Simulation. The Progressive Lens Simulator can be Head-mounted. A Guided Lens Design Exploration System for the Progressive Lens Simulator can include a Progressive Lens Simulator, a Feedback-Control Interface, and a Progressive Lens Design processor, to generate a modified progressive lens simulation for the patient after a guided modification of the progressive lens design. A Deep Learning Method for an Artificial Intelligence Engine can be used for a Progressive Lens Design Processor. Embodiments include a multi-station system of Progressive Lens Simulators and a Central Supervision Station.
