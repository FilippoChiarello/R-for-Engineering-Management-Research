<claims>
1. A method of operating a hearing aid system comprising the steps of: providing a plurality of input signal sets, each consisting of two input signals, wherein the input signals represent the output from a microphone; transforming the input signals from a time domain representation and into a time-frequency domain representation; estimating an inter-microphone phase difference between the input signals for each of said plurality of input signal sets using the time-frequency domain representation of the input signals; determining an unbiased mean phase and a mapped mean resultant length, from each of said estimated inter-microphone phase differences; estimating a time difference of arrival, for each of said input signal sets, using a plurality of unbiased mean phases weighted by a corresponding plurality of reliability measures, wherein each of the reliability measures are derived at least partly from a corresponding mapped mean resultant length; deriving an estimate of a local direction of arrival and a corresponding local reliability measure for each of the estimated time difference of arrivals, wherein the local reliability measures are at least partly derived from the corresponding mapped mean resultant lengths; providing an estimate of a common direction of arrival by combining the estimated local directions of arrival and the corresponding local reliability measures; using the estimate of the common direction of arrival as input to at least one hearing aid system processing stage.
2. The method according to claim 1 comprising the further step of: providing a common reliability measure corresponding to the estimated common direction of arrival by combining the estimated local directions of arrival and the corresponding local reliability measures.
3. The method according to claim 2 comprising the further step of: using the common reliability measure as input to the at least one hearing aid system processing stage.
4. The method according to claim 2, wherein the step of providing an estimate of a common direction of arrival comprises the further steps of: providing a plurality of estimates of the common direction of arrival and corresponding common reliability measures as input to a smoothing filter adapted to operate based on at least one of Kalman filtering, Bayesian filtering and machine learning methods utilizing a statistical model of the provided data and prior estimates.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the at least one hearing aid system processing stage is selected from a group of hearing aid system processing stages comprising: spatially informed speech extraction and noise reduction, enhanced beamforming through provided steering vectors and corresponding suitable constraints, spatialization of streamed audio from an external microphone device, auditory scene analyses and classification based on the possible detection of one or more specific sound sources, improved source separation, audio zoom, improved spatial signal compression, improved speech detection, acoustical feedback detection, user behavior estimation and own voice detection.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein the step of providing the estimate of the common direction of arrival by combining the estimated local directions of arrival and the corresponding local reliability measures comprises the further steps of: mapping all the estimated local directions of arrival onto a full circle and hereby providing a monaural and a binaural direction of arrival estimate; using a statistical test in order to assess whether the monaural and binaural direction of arrival estimates have a common mean; combining the monaural and binaural direction of arrival estimates and hereby providing the estimate of the common direction of arrival if a statistical test assesses that the monaural and binaural direction of arrival estimates have a common mean.
7. The method according to claim 1, wherein the step of providing the estimate of the common direction of arrival by combining the estimated local directions of arrival and the corresponding local reliability measures comprises the further steps of: mapping all the estimated local directions of arrival onto a full circle and hereby providing a monaural and a binaural direction of arrival estimate; using a statistical test in order to assess whether the monaural and binaural direction of arrival estimates have a common mean and if this is not the case carrying out the further steps of; determining whether the monaural or binaural direction of arrival estimate is most reliable based on the corresponding monaural and binaural reliability measures; selecting as the estimate of the common direction of arrival the direction of arrival estimate that is most reliable.
8. The method according to claim 2, wherein the steps of providing the estimate of the common direction of arrival and the estimate of the corresponding common reliability measure by combining the estimated local directions of arrival and the corresponding local reliability measures comprises the further steps of: mapping all the estimated local directions of arrival onto a full circle; using statistical methods selected from a group of methods comprising statistical tests, Bayesian methods and machine learning methods in order to combine the local direction of arrival estimates to provide the estimate of the common direction of arrival and the estimate of the corresponding common reliability measure.
9. The method according to claim 1, wherein the mapped mean resultant length {tilde over (R)}ab (k,l) is determined, at least partly, using an expression from a group of expressions comprising: expressions of the form given by:

10. A hearing aid system comprising a first and a second hearing aid and a binaural wireless link between the two hearing aids, wherein each of the hearing aids comprises a set of microphones, a filter bank, a digital signal processor and an electrical-acoustical output transducer; wherein the binaural wireless link is adapted to provide, for each of the hearing aids, transmission of at least one ipse-lateral input signal, from an ipse-lateral microphone, to the contra-lateral hearing aid whereby at least one binaural microphone set is provided; wherein the filter bank is adapted to: transform the input signals from the provided microphone sets from a time domain representation and into a time-frequency domain representation; wherein the digital signal processor is configured to apply a frequency dependent gain that is adapted to at least one of suppressing noise and alleviating a hearing deficit of an individual wearing the hearing aid system; wherein the digital signal processor is adapted to: estimating inter-microphone phase differences between the input signals for each of the provided microphone sets using the time-frequency domain representation of the input signals; determining an unbiased mean phase and a mapped mean resultant length, from each of said estimated inter-microphone phase differences; estimating a time difference of arrival, for each of said input signal sets, using a plurality of unbiased mean phases weighted by a corresponding plurality of reliability measures, wherein each of the reliability measures are derived at least partly from a corresponding mapped mean resultant length; deriving an estimate of a local direction of arrival and a corresponding local reliability measure for each of the estimated time difference of arrivals, wherein the local reliability measures are at least partly derived from the corresponding mapped mean resultant lengths; providing an estimate of a common direction of arrival by combining the estimated local directions of arrival and the corresponding local reliability measures; and using the estimate of the common direction of arrival as input to at least one hearing aid system processing stage.
