METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR OBSTACLE DETECTION
</title>

<abstract>
A method for detecting obstacles, the method may include receiving, from a plurality of vehicles, and by an I/O module of a computerized system, visual information acquired during executions of vehicle maneuvers that are suspected as being obstacle avoidance maneuvers; determining, based at least on the visual information, at least one visual obstacle identifier for visually identifying at least one obstacle; and transmitting to one or more of the plurality of vehicles, the at least one visual obstacle identifier.

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for detecting obstacles, the method comprises: receiving, from a plurality of vehicles, and by an I/O module of a computerized system, visual information acquired during executions of vehicle maneuvers that are suspected as being obstacle avoidance maneuvers; determining, based at least on the visual information, at least one visual obstacle identifier for visually identifying at least one obstacle; and transmitting to one or more of the plurality of vehicles, the at least one visual obstacle identifier.
2. The method according to claim 1 wherein a visual obstacle identifier for visually identifying an obstacle is a model of the obstacle.
3. The method according to claim 1 wherein a visual obstacle identifier for visually identifying an obstacle is a robust signature of the obstacle.
4. The method according to claim 1 wherein a visual obstacle identifier for visually identifying an obstacle comprises configuration information of a neural network related to the obstacle.
5. The method according to claim 1 wherein a visual obstacle identifier for visually identifying an obstacle identifies a group of obstacles to which the obstacle belongs.
6. The method according to claim 1 wherein the visual information comprises one or more robust signatures of one or more images acquired by one or more visual sensors of the vehicle.
7. The method according to claim 1 wherein a visual obstacle identifier for visually identifying an obstacle comprises severity metadata indicative of a severity of the obstacle.
8. The method according to claim 1 wherein a visual obstacle identifier for visually identifying an obstacle comprises type metadata indicative of a type of the obstacle.
9. The method according to claim 1 wherein a visual obstacle identifier for visually identifying an obstacle comprises size metadata indicative of a size of the obstacle.
10. The method according to claim 1 wherein a visual obstacle identifier for visually identifying an obstacle comprises timing metadata indicative of a timing of an existence of the obstacle.
11. The method according to claim 1 wherein a visual obstacle identifier for visually identifying an obstacle comprises location metadata indicative of a location of an existence of the obstacle
12. The method according to claim 1 wherein the determining of the at least one visual obstacle identifier comprises clustering visual information related to different obstacles to different clusters.
13. The method according to claim 1 comprising receiving behavioral information regarding behavior of the plurality of vehicles, during an execution of the maneuvers that are suspected as being obstacle avoidance maneuvers.
14. The method according to claim 13 wherein the behavioral information is obtained by non-visual sensors of the plurality of vehicles.
15. The method according to claim 13 comprising verifying, based on at least the visual information, whether the maneuvers that are suspected as being obstacle avoidance maneuvers are actually obstacle avoidance maneuvers.
16. The method according to claim 15 comprising transmitting to one or more of the plurality of vehicles, verification information indicative of the maneuvers that are actually obstacle avoidance maneuvers.
17. The method according to claim 1 comprising filtering objects that are represented in the visual information based on a frequency of appearance of the objects in the visual information.
18. The method according to claim 1 wherein a visual obstacle identifier for visually identifying an obstacle is a concept structure of the obstacle.
19. A non-transitory computer readable medium that stores instructions for: receiving, from a plurality of vehicles, and by an I/O module of a computerized system, visual information acquired during executions of vehicle maneuvers that are suspected as being obstacle avoidance maneuvers; determining, based at least on the visual information, at least one visual obstacle identifier for visually identifying at least one obstacle; and transmitting to one or more of the plurality of vehicles, the at least one visual obstacle identifier.
20. A computerized system that comprises a processor and multiple units that are configured to receiving, from a plurality of vehicles, and by an I/O module of a computerized system, visual information acquired during executions of vehicle maneuvers that are suspected as being obstacle avoidance maneuvers; determining, based at least on the visual information, at least one visual obstacle identifier for visually identifying at least one obstacle; and transmitting to one or more of the plurality of vehicles, the at least one visual obstacle identifier.
