IMAGE PROCESSING DEVICE, IMAGE PROCESSING METHOD AND OBJECT RECOGNITION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
An image processing device has circuitry, which is configured to obtain image data, the image data being generated on the basis of a non-linear mapping defining a mapping between an object plane and an image plane; and to process the image data by applying a kernel of an artificial network to the image data based on the non-linear mapping.
