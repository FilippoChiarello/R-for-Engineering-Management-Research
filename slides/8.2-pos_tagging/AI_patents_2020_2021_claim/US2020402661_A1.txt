MEDICAL DATA PROCESSING APPARATUS AND MEDICAL DATA PROCESSING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
One embodiment, a medical data processing apparatus includes processing circuitry. The processing circuitry obtains medical data relating to a subject, and outputs medical diagnostic data obtained by performing predetermined processing on the medical data, along with standardized medical data based on the medical data, the standardized medical date being standardized for machine learning without performing part or all of the predetermined processing.

<claims>
1. A medical data processing apparatus comprising: a processing circuitry configured to: obtain medical data relating to a subject; and output medical diagnostic data obtained by performing predetermined processing on the medical data, along with standardized medical data based on the medical data, the standardized medical date being standardized for machine learning without performing part or all of the predetermined processing.
2. The medical data processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the medical data is raw data relating to the subject acquired by the medical image diagnostic apparatus, and the processing circuitry is configured to: generate converted data by performing mapping processing as the part of the predetermined processing on the raw data; generate post-processed data by performing post-processing as another part of the predetermined processing on the converted data, and output the post-processed data as the medical diagnostic data; and output the converted data as the standardized medical data without performing all the post-processing.
3. The medical data processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the medical data is raw data relating to the subject collected by the medical image diagnostic apparatus, and the processing circuitry is configured to: generate converted data by performing mapping processing as the part of the predetermined processing on the raw data; generate first post-processed data by performing all of the post-processing as another part of the predetermined processing on the converted data, and output the first post-processed data as the medical diagnostic data; and generate second post-processed data by performing part of the post-processing on the converted data, and output the second post-processed data as the standardized medical data.
4. The medical data processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the medical data is raw data relating to the subject collected by the medical image diagnostic apparatus, and the processing circuitry is configured to: generate converted data by performing mapping processing as the part of the predetermined processing on the raw data; output as the medical diagnostic data, image processed data obtained by performing, as another part of the predetermined processing, post-processing of a first parameter set by a user; and output the standardized medical data obtained by performing the post-processing of a second parameter standardized for machine learning on the converted data.
5. The medical data processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein medical data is raw data relating to the subject acquired by the medical image diagnostic apparatus, and the processing circuitry is configured to: generate pre-processed data by performing pre-processing as part of the predetermined processing on the raw data, and output the medical diagnostic data obtained by performing image conversion processing as another part of the predetermined processing on the pre-processed data; and output the standardized medical data obtained by performing the image conversion processing on the raw data.
6. The medical data processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry is configured to encrypt the standardized medical data.
7. The medical data processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry is configured to output a single DICOM file including the medical diagnostic data and the standardized medical data.
8. The medical data processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry is configured to automatically transmit the standardized medical data to a computer for machine learning.
9. The medical data processing apparatus according to claim 8, wherein the processing circuitry is configured to display on a display device the medical diagnostic data and result data of machine learning received from a computer for machine learning.
10. The medical data processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry is configured to display on a display device a screen for selecting whether to output the medical diagnostic data and/or whether to output the standardized medical data.
11. The medical data processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the processing circuitry is configured to assign to the medical diagnostic data information indicating that the medical diagnostic data is not for machine learning, and/or assign to the standardized medical data information indicating that the standardized medical data is for machine learning.
12. A medical data processing method comprising: obtaining medical data relating to a subject; and outputting medical diagnostic data obtained by performing predetermined processing on the medical data, along with standardized medical data based on the medical data, the standardized medical date being standardized for machine learning without performing part or all of the predetermined processing.
