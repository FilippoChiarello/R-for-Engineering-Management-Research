RELAXATION OPTIMIZATION MODEL TO PLAN AN OPEN SPACE TRAJECTORY FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
</title>

<abstract>
In one embodiment, an open space model is generated for a system to plan trajectories for an ADV in an open space. The system perceives an environment surrounding an ADV including one or more obstacles. The system determines a target function for the open space model based on constraints for the one or more obstacles and map information. The system iteratively, performs a first quadratic programming (QP) optimization on the target function based on a first trajectory while fixing a first set of variables, and performs a second QP optimization on the target function based on a result of the first QP optimization while fixing a second set of variables. The system generates a second trajectory based on results of the first and the second QP optimizations to control the ADV autonomously according to the second trajectory.
