<title>
SAFETY-RATED MULTI-CELL WORKSPACE MAPPING AND MONITORING
</title>

<abstract>
Safety systems in distributed factory workcells intercommunicate or communicate with a central controller so that when a person, robot or vehicle passes from one workcell or space into another on the same factory floor, the new workcell or space need not repeat the tasks of analysis and classification and can instead immediately integrate the new entrant into the existing workcell or space-monitoring schema. The workcell or space can also communicate attributes such as occlusions, unsafe areas, movement speed, and object trajectories, enabling rapid reaction by the monitoring system of the new workcell or space.

<claims>
1. A safety system for identifying safe regions in a three-dimensional workspace that includes controlled machinery and a plurality of workcells distributed about the workspace, the system comprising, in each workcell: a plurality of sensors distributed about the workcell, each of the sensors being associated with a grid of pixels for recording images of a portion of the workcell within a sensor field of view; and a controller configured to: register the sensors with respect to each other so that the images obtained by the sensors collectively represent the workspace; generate a three-dimensional representation of the workcell as a plurality of volumes; map one or more safe volumetric zones within the workcell, the volumetric zones being outside a safety zone of the machinery; receive, from a second controller, a three-dimensional representation of at least a portion of an adjacent workcell as a plurality of volumes; and transmit, to the second controller, at least a portion of the three-dimensional representation of the workcell as a plurality of volumes.
2. The safety system of claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to classify each of the volumes as unoccupied, occupied or unknown, the safe volumetric zones being marked as unoccupied.
3. The safety system of claim 1, wherein the volumes in the three-dimensional representation received from the second controller are classified as unoccupied, occupied or unknown.
4. The safety system of claim 1, wherein the controller is further configured to transmit, to the second controller, predicted movements of objects in the workcell into the adjacent workcell.
5. The safety system of claim 1, wherein the points are voxels.
6. The safety system of claim 1, wherein the safety zone is a 3D volume surrounding at least a portion of the machinery.
7. The safety system of claim 4, wherein the second controller is responsive to the predicted movements and is configured to alter operation of machinery in the adjacent workcell response to a predicted intrusion into a safety zone of the second workcell.
8. The safety system of claim 7, wherein the second controller is configured to computationally extend the predicted intrusion into the workcell in accordance with a model of human movement.
9. The safety system of claim 1, wherein the workcell portions partially overlap.
10. The safety system of claim 7, wherein the second controller is configured to computationally extend the predicted intrusion into the workcell in accordance with a trajectory of an autonomous guided vehicle.
11. The safety system of claim 7, wherein the trajectory is communicated by the autonomous guided vehicle to the second controller.
12. The safety system of claim 1, wherein at least some of the sensors are 3D sensors.
13. The safety system of claim 12, wherein at least some of the sensors are time-of-flight cameras.
14. The safety system of claim 12, wherein at least some of the sensors are 3D LIDAR sensors.
15. A safety system for identifying safe regions in a three-dimensional workspace including controlled machinery and a plurality of workcells distributed about the workspace, the system comprising: a supervisory controller; and in each workcell, a plurality of sensors distributed about the workcell, each of the sensors being associated with a grid of pixels for recording images of a portion of the workcell within a sensor field of view, the workcell portions at least partially overlapping with each other; and a local controller configured to: register the sensors with respect to each other so that the images obtained by the sensors collectively represent the workcell; generate a three-dimensional representation of the workcell as a plurality of volumes; map one or more safe volumetric zones within the workcell, the volumetric zones being outside a safety zone of the machinery; and transmit, to the supervisory controller, at least a portion of the three-dimensional representation of the workcell as a plurality of volumes, wherein the supervisory controller is configured to transmit, to each local controller, predicted movements of objects into the workcell associated with the local controller based on data received from other local controllers.
16. The safety system of claim 15, wherein the local controller is further configured to classify each of the volumes as unoccupied, occupied or unknown, the safe volumetric zones being marked as unoccupied.
17. The safety system of claim 15, wherein the points are voxels.
18. The safety system of claim 15, wherein the safety zone is a 3D volume surrounding at least a portion of the machinery.
19. The safety system of claim 15, wherein the local controller of each workcell is responsive to the predicted movements and is configured to alter operation of machinery in the workcell in response to a predicted intrusion into a safety zone thereof.
20. The safety system of claim 19, wherein each local controller is configured to computationally extend a predicted intrusion into the workcell in accordance with a model of human movement.
21. The safety system of claim 15, wherein at least some of the sensors are 3D sensors.
22. The safety system of claim 21, wherein at least some of the sensors are time-of-flight cameras.
23. The safety system of claim 21, wherein at least some of the sensors are 3D LIDAR sensors.
