<title>
ELECTROMAGNETIC IMAGING AND INVERSION OF SIMPLE PARAMETERS IN STORAGE BINS
</title>

<abstract>
A method for electromagnetic imaging of containers receives uncalibrated first data corresponding to signals of a first plurality of different frequencies associated with an antenna array residing in a container having contents. The method estimates of a second data based on a computer model and simulation of signals of a second plurality of different frequencies associated with the antenna array, the second plurality of different frequencies including a subset of the first plurality of different frequencies. The method compares magnitudes, without corresponding phase comparisons, of the first and second data at each frequency of the second plurality of different frequencies. The method updates the second data based on the comparing. The method provides information about the contents within the container based on the updated second data.

<claims>
At least the following is claimed:
1. A method for electromagnetic imaging of containers, comprising: in one or more processors: receiving uncalibrated first data corresponding to signals of a first plurality of different frequencies associated with an antenna array residing in a container having contents; estimating second data based on a computer model and simulation of signals of a second plurality of different frequencies associated with the antenna array, the second plurality of different frequencies comprising a subset of the first plurality of different frequencies; comparing magnitudes, without corresponding phase comparisons, of the first and second data at each frequency of the second plurality of different frequencies; updating the second data based on the comparing; and providing information about the contents within the container based on the updated second data.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein receiving comprises receiving uncalibrated S-parameter measurement data.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein estimating comprises estimating one or more parameters of the contents in the container.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the one or more parameters comprises one or more geometric parameters that describe one or more interfaces between various contents of the container.
5. The method of claim 3, wherein the contents comprise grain, and wherein the one or more parameters comprises one or any combination of grain permittivity or geometric parameters corresponding to grain volume.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the estimating comprises using an electromagnetic solver with the computer model to simulate the signals associated with the second data expected to be received at the antenna array.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the electromagnetic solver comprises any one of a 3D finite-element method forward direct solver, a finite difference method, a method of moments, or computational electromagnetic forward solver.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein updating comprises using an optimization algorithm iteratively.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the updating is repeated until one of the comparing results in a minimum value or changes in the second data are lower than a threshold level.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the updated second data comprises permittivity information and geometry information corresponding to contents within the container.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the contents comprises grain, and wherein the updated second data comprises real and imaginary permittivity of the grain, grain height, and cone angle.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein providing comprises providing a visualization of the container and geometries of the contents within the container.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein providing comprises providing moisture content of the contents within the container.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein providing further comprises: using the first data to derive calibration coefficients; and performing pixel-based inversion based on the calibration coefficients and prior information.
