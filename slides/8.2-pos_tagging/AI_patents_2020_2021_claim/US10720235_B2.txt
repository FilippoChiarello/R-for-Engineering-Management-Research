<title>
Method and system for preference-driven food personalization
</title>

<abstract>
A method for improving food-related personalized for a user including determining food-related preferences associated with a plurality of users to generate a user food preferences database; collecting dietary inputs from a subject matter expert (SME) at an SME interface associated with the user food preferences database; determining personalized food parameters for the user based on the user food-related preferences and the dietary inputs; receiving feedback associated with the personalized food parameters from the user; and updating the user food preferences database based on the feedback.
</abstract>

<claims>
We claim:
1. A method for improving food-related personalized for a user comprising: determining food-related preferences associated with a plurality of users, comprising: collecting selections from each of the plurality of users at a user interface, and explicitly determining food-related preferences based on the selections, inferring food-related preferences of each of the plurality of users based on user actions in relation to the user interface, and mapping food-related preferences to food parameters represented in a recipe vector space to generate a user food preferences database, wherein mapping food-related preferences to food parameters comprises: providing the food-related preferences to a trained neural network model as input vectors, wherein the trained neural network model comprises a plurality of neuronal layers that each transform the input vector received from the preceding neuronal layer of the plurality of neuronal layers into an intermediate vector provided as an input vector to a subsequent neuronal layer, wherein the food parameters define a vector in the recipe vector space equivalent to an intermediate vector transformed by one of the plurality of neuronal layers; collecting dietary inputs from a subject matter expert (SME) at an SME interface associated with the user food preferences database; determining personalized food parameters for the user based on the user food-related preferences and the dietary inputs; generating a recipe based on the personalized food parameters; and automatically facilitating preparation of the recipe by the user comprising controlling a connected cooking appliance based on the personalized food parameters.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the food-related preferences comprise at least one of health goals, taste preferences, and dietary restrictions of each of the plurality of users.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein determining the food-related preferences comprises applying natural language processing to medical records associated with at least one user to extract health goals associated with the at least one user.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein determining food-related preferences further comprises collecting an exogenous signal from a third-party entity.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the exogenous signal comprises social media content, and determining food-related preferences of at least one user of the plurality of users comprises inferring food-related preferences based on social media content sampled from a social media account associated with the at least one user.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein the exogenous signal comprises an output of natural language processing of electronic messages exchanged by the user.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein inferring food-related preferences based on user actions comprises inferring food-related preferences of at least one user of the plurality of users from a historical record of food item usage rate by that user.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein explicitly determining food-related preferences based on the selections comprises: defining an initial preference vector, associated with each of the plurality of users, in the recipe vector space, wherein the initial preference vector defines a first coverage of the recipe vector space; generating a minimal set of candidate recipes in the recipe vector space, based on the first coverage, wherein the minimal set of candidate recipes defines a second coverage of the recipe vector space; collecting selections from the minimal set of candidate recipes; and updating the initial preference vector to generate an updated preference vector associated with each of the plurality of users.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the second coverage is complementary to the first coverage of the recipe vector space.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein collecting dietary inputs comprises collecting labeled training data for a machine-learning based dietary model, wherein the labeled training data comprises dietary data represented in the recipe vector space, and wherein dietary data are labeled according to the dimensions of the recipe vector space.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein collecting dietary inputs comprises dividing the plurality of users into subgroups of users based on shared user food-related preferences according to a series of computer-implemented dietary rules, and wherein determining personalized food parameters for the user is based on the shared food-related preferences of the user's subgroup.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the SME comprises a trained machine-learning based dietary model.
13. The method of claim 1, wherein the personalized food parameters comprise a set of recipe vectors represented in the recipe vector space, wherein the food-related preferences define a vector magnitude constraint, and wherein each of the recipe vectors in the set of recipe vectors defines a magnitude less than the vector magnitude constraint.
