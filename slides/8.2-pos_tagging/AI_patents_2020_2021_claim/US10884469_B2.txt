<title>
Method and system for dynamically allocating and optimizing power resources
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for dynamically allocating power resources. The system includes a central controller connected to automatic transfer switches. The system also includes power zones. Each of the power zones includes server devices. Each of the automatic transfer switches are connected to at least one of the power zones. The system also includes a power pool connected to a power source. The power pool is connected to the central controller configured to dynamically allocate power of the power pool to the power zones.

<claims>
1. A method for dynamically allocating power resources in real-time, the method comprising: retrieving a power usage measurement from a plurality of server devices within at least one of a first set of server devices and at least one of a second set of server devices; determining in real time whether the plurality of server devices include at least one of a power gap and at least one of an unused power supply; upon determining in real time whether the plurality of server devices include at least one of the power gap and at least one of the unused power supply, determining a power distribution strategy in real time based on the power gap and the unused power supply; and upon determining the power distribution strategy in real time, directing power in real time to at least one of the plurality of server devices within the at least one of the first set of server devices and the at least one of the second set of server devices based on the determined power distribution strategy.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising periodically monitoring power usage of the plurality of server devices.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the power usage measurement of the plurality of server devices is retrieved by a Pooled System Management Engine (PSME) unit.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein at least one of the power gap and at least one of the unused power supply is present when the plurality of server devices are initially installed within one or more chassis devices.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein at least one of the power gap and at least one of the unused power supply is present when a redundancy mode is implemented for a current distribution of power.
6. A system for dynamically allocating power resources in an information handling system, the system comprising: a central controller connected to a plurality of automatic transfer switches; a plurality of power zones, wherein each of the plurality of power zones includes a plurality of server devices, wherein each of the plurality of automatic transfer switches are connected to at least one of the plurality of power zones; and a power pool connected to a power source, wherein the power pool is connected to the central controller, the central controller being configured to dynamically allocate the power of the power pool to the at least one of the plurality of power zones by causing the system to: (i) retrieve a power usage measurement from a plurality of server devices, (ii) determine in real time whether the plurality of server devices include at least one of a power gap and at least one of a unused power supply, (iii) determine in real time a power distribution strategy based on determining whether the plurality of server devices include at least one of determining the power distribution strategy in real time, direct power in real time to at least one of the plurality of server devices based on the determined power distribution strategy.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the plurality of server devices include at least one of a storage chassis, a GPU chassis, a storage chassis, and an accelerator chassis.
8. The system of claim 6, wherein the central controller is connected to the plurality of server devices via a management bar to retrieve a power usage measurement of each of the server devices within the plurality of server devices.
9. The system of claim 6, wherein the power pool is connected to the plurality of automatic transfer switches, such that the central controller directs power to the each of the plurality of power zones.
10. The system of claim 6, further comprising a plurality of power bars configured to connect the power pool to the each of the plurality of power zones, via the plurality of automatic transfer switches.
11. A non-transitory machine-readable medium having stored thereon instructions for performing a method comprising machine executable code that when executed by at least one machine, causes the machine to: retrieve a power usage measurement from a plurality of server devices within at least one of a first set of server devices and at least one of a second set of server devices; determine in real time whether the plurality of server device include at least one of a power gap and at least one of unused power supply; upon determining in real time whether the plurality of server device include at least one of the power gap and at least one of the unused power supply, determine a power distribution strategy in real time based on the power gap and the unused power supply; and upon determining the power distribution strategy in real time, direct power in real time to at least one of the plurality of server devices within the at least one of the first set of server devices and the at least one of the second set of server devices based on the determined power distribution strategy.
12. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 11, further comprising periodically monitoring power usage of the plurality of server devices.
13. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 11, wherein the power usage measurement of the plurality of server devices is retrieved by a Pooled System Management Engine (PSME) unit.
14. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 11, wherein at least one of the power gap and at least one of the unused power supply is present when the plurality of server devices are initially installed within one or more chassis devices.
15. The non-transitory machine-readable medium of claim 11, wherein at least one of the power gap and at least one of the unused power supply are present when a redundancy mode is implemented for a current distribution of power.
