FOOTWEAR HAVING MOTORIZED ADJUSTMENT SYSTEM AND REMOVABLE MIDSOLE
</title>

<abstract>
An article of footwear may include an upper configured to receive a foot of a wearer and a sole structure fixedly attached to the upper, the sole structure including a ground-contacting outer member and a removable midsole. The footwear may further include a motorized tensioning system including a power source, a control unit, a tensile member, and a motorized tightening device, at least one lace receiving member fixedly attached to one or more substantially inelastic portions of the upper and provided on a medial side of the article of footwear, at least one lace receiving member fixedly attached to one or more substantially inelastic portions of the upper and provided on a lateral side of the article of footwear, wherein the tensile member is threaded through the at least one lace receiving member on the medial side of the article of footwear, extends across an instep region and is threaded through the at least one lace receiving member on the lateral side of the article of footwear, the tightening device being configured to apply tension in the tensile member to adjust the size of an internal void defined by the article of footwear. In addition, the power source and the control unit of the tensioning system may be configured to be removably disposed in the removable midsole.

<claims>
1. An article of footwear, comprising: an upper configured to receive a foot of a wearer; a sole structure fixedly attached to the upper, the sole structure including a ground-contacting outer member and a removable midsole; a motorized tensioning system including a power source, a control unit, a motorized tightening device and a tensile member; at least one lace receiving member fixedly attached to one or more substantially inelastic portions of the upper and provided on a medial side of the article of footwear; and at least one lace receiving member fixedly attached to one or more substantially inelastic portions of the upper and provided on a lateral side of the article of footwear; wherein the tensile member is threaded through the at least one lace receiving member on the medial side of the article of footwear, extends across an instep region and is threaded through the at least one lace receiving member on the lateral side of the article of footwear; wherein the tightening device is configured to apply tension in the tensile member to adjust a size of an internal void defined by the article of footwear; and wherein the power source and the control unit of the tensioning system are configured to be removably disposed in the removable midsole.
2. The article of footwear of claim 1, wherein the tightening device is disposed within a tightening device housing.
3. The article of footwear of claim 2, wherein the tightening device housing is fixedly attached to the upper.
4. The article of footwear of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the removable midsole includes at least one recess on a lower side of the midsole configured to receive the power source and the control unit.
5. The article of footwear of claim 2, wherein the tightening device housing has a tamper-resistant construction, including a first portion formed of a first, substantially rigid plastic, and a second portion formed of a second material fixedly attached to the first portion, the second portion configured to be destructively opened to provide access for removal of the tightening device.
6. The article of footwear of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the removable midsole is configured to be removed from the article of footwear through an opening configured to receive a foot of a wearer.
7. The article of footwear of any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the power source is configured to power the tightening device; and
wherein the control unit is configured to control operation of the tightening device.
8. The article of footwear of any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the motorized tightening device is configured to be controlled by a remote device.
9. A footwear adjustment system including an article of footwear according to any one of the claims 1 to 8 and a remote device configured to communicate with the tensioning system.
10. A method of making an article of footwear, comprising: securing a sole structure to an upper, the upper configured to receive a foot of a wearer, the sole structure including a ground-contacting outer member and a removable midsole; removably attaching a motorized tightening device to the upper; removably disposing a power source and a control unit in a removable midsole; fixedly attaching at least one lace receiving member to one or more substantially inelastic portions of the upper provided on a medial side of the article of footwear; fixedly attaching at least one lace receiving member to one or more substantially inelastic portions of the upper provided on a lateral side of the article of footwear; and threading the tensile member through the at least one lace receiving member on the medial side of the article of footwear, the tensile member further extending across an instep region and threading the tensile member through the at least one lace receiving member on the lateral side of the article of footwear; wherein the motorized tightening device is configured to apply tension in the tensile member to adjust a size of an internal void defined by the article of footwear.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising disposing the tightening device within a tightening device housing.
12. The method of claim 10 or 11, wherein the removable midsole includes at least one recess on a lower side of the midsole configured to receive the power source and the control unit.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the tightening device housing has a tamper-resistant construction, including a first portion formed of a first, substantially rigid plastic, and a second portion formed of a second material fixedly attached to the first portion, the second portion configured to be destructively opened to provide access for removal of the tightening device.
14. The method of any one of claims 10 to 13, wherein the removable midsole is configured to be removed from the article of footwear through an opening configured to receive a foot of a wearer.
