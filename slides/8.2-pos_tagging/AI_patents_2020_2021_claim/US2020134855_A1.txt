IMAGE PROCESSING FOR OCCLUDED ITEM RECOGNITION
</title>

<abstract>
Cameras capture time-stamped images of predefined areas. Individuals and items are tracked in the images. Occluded items detected in the images are preprocessed to remove pixels associated with occluded information and the pixels remaining associated with the items are cropped. The preprocessed and cropped images are provided to a trained machine-learning algorithm or a trained neural network trained to classify and identify the items. Output received from the trained neural network provides item identifiers for the items that are present in the original images.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: receiving an image depicting an unknown item that is occluded in the image; preprocessing the image and producing a modified image that includes item pixels associated with the unknown item; identifying a known item identifier for the unknown item from the item pixels of the modified image; and providing the known item identifier.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein receiving further includes receiving a list of potential known item identifiers for the unknown item from a machine-learning algorithm that was provided the image as input and produces the list as output based on a location of a camera that captured the image.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein receiving further includes receiving the list from an item tracker of a frictionless store system, wherein the item tracker was unable to determine the known item identifier from the image.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein preprocessing further includes using pixel attributes associated with known items of the list and other pixels attributes associated with a tracked person in the image when producing the modified image.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein preprocessing further includes clustering image pixels of the image by color and blacking out a first color associated with a tracked person in the modified image.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein clustering further includes normalizing the image pixels by scaling the image pixels to a predefined range of values in the modified image.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein grey scaling the image pixels in the modified image.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein grey scaling further includes performing edge detection on edges present in the modified image.
9. The method of claim 9, wherein performing further includes blacking out non-color pixels in the modified image that are not associated with the edges.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein blacking out further includes cropping the modified image retaining the item pixels in a cropped modified image.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein identifying further includes inputting the cropped modified image to a trained machine-learning algorithm that returns as output the known item identifier.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein inputting further includes inputting a list of potential known item identifiers for the unknown item with the cropped modified image as input to the trained machine-learning algorithm.
13. A method, comprising: determining that an unknown item is present in an occluded image; preprocessing pixels in the occluded image producing a modified image; cropping the modified image to include just unknown pixels for the unknown item in a cropped image; providing the cropped image to a trained machine-learning algorithm; receiving as output from the trained machine-learning algorithm a list of potential known item identifiers for known items, each potential known item identifier assigned a confidence value by the machine-learning algorithm in the list; selecting a particular known item identifier from the list based on a highest confidence value provided with the list; and providing the particular known item identifier to a transaction manager for adding to a virtual shopping cart maintained for a person being tracked in the occluded image and other images within a frictionless store.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein determining further includes processing a different machine learning algorithm to determines that the unknown item is present in the occluded image but unable to be assigned any known item identifier for a known item.
15. The method of claim 13, wherein preprocessing further includes blacking out select pixels in the modified that are not associated with the unknown pixels associated with the unknown item.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein blacking out further includes performing edge detection on modified pixels within the modified image producing edges within the modified image.
17. The method of claim 13, wherein cropping further includes cropping the modified image based on the edges producing the cropped image.
18. The method of claim 13, wherein providing further includes provide as input to the trained machine-learning algorithm a set of expected known item identifiers for the trained machine-learning algorithm to select from when producing the list based on a location that the occluded image was taken from.
19. A system, comprising: cameras configured to capture images within a store; a server that includes a processor; the processor configured to execute executable instructions from a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium as an item recognizer; the item recognizer when executed on the processor configured to: preprocess an occluded image that depicts an unknown item to produce a modified image having unknown item pixels; pass the modified image to a machine-learning algorithm as input; receive as output from the machine-learning algorithm a known item identifier for a known item represented in the occluded image; and provide the known item identifier to a transaction manager that maintains a virtual shopping cart for a tracked person within a frictionless store for processing with a transaction.
20. The system of claim 19, wherein the action manager is further configured to preprocess to: remove pixels from the occluded image that are not associated with the unknown item pixels and crop out just the unknown item pixels as the modified image.
