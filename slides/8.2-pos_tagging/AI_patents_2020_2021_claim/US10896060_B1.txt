Resource monitor for monitoring long-standing computing resources
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein are system, apparatus, article of manufacture, method, and/or computer program product embodiments for monitoring long-standing computing resources. An apparatus may operate by receiving a cloud monitoring notification, where the cloud monitoring notification may indicate an occurrence of a monitored condition. The apparatus may then operate by scanning a cluster computing system for resource having a client assigned resource identifier and a computing resource attribute based on a resource identifier scan parameter and a resource attribute scan parameter. The apparatus may further operate by generating a resource notification request based on the scanning of the cluster computing system and transmitting the resource notification request to a communications system to notify a user that the resource has a computing resource attribute that match the resource attribute scan parameter.
