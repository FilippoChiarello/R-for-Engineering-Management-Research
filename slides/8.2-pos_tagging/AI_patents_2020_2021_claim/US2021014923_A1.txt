RADIO LINK FAILURE RECOVERY WITH SRB3 IN MR-DC
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments herein provide a transfer framework and procedure for a failure indication and subsequent recover message for a user equipment (UE) in multi-radio access technology (MR)-dual connectivity (DC). For example, in embodiments, a UE may send an indication of a radio link failure (RLF) on a master node (MN) to a secondary node (SN) via a signalling radio bearer type 3 (SRB3). The SN may forward the indication to the MN (e.g., in a transparent manner). In some embodiments, the indication may be formatted in the same format as messages on signalling radio bearer type 1 (SRB1). Other embodiments may be described and claimed.

<claims>
1. One or more non-transitory computer-readable media (NTCRM) having instructions, stored thereon, that when executed by one or more processors cause a user equipment (UE) to: communicate with a master node (MN) and a secondary node (SN) using multi-radio access technology (MR)-dual connectivity (DC); detecting a radio link failure (RLF) on the MN; and encoding an indication of the detected RLF for transmission to a secondary node (SN) over signalling radio bearer type 3 (SRB3).
2. The one or more NTCRM of claim 1, wherein, to encode the indication, the UE is to generate a failure indication message used for split signalling radio bearer type 1 (SRB1) to be the failure indication for the SRB3.
3. The one or more NTCRM of claim 2, wherein the instructions, when executed, are further to cause the UE to receive a reconfiguration message or recovery message over SRB3, wherein the reconfiguration message or recovery message is a same reconfiguration message or recovery message sent over a split SRB1.
4. The one or more NTCRM of claim 3, wherein the instructions, when executed, are further to cause the UE to process the reconfiguration message or recovery message in a same manner as the UE is configured to process the reconfiguration message or recovery message of the split SRB1.
5. The one or more NTCRM of claim 3, wherein the failure indication message and the reconfiguration message or recovery message are tunneled transparently between the UE and a master node (MN) over SRB3.
6. One or more non-transitory computer-readable media (NTCRM) having instructions, stored thereon, that when executed by one or more processors cause a secondary node (SN) to: communicate with a user equipment (UE) using multi-radio access technology (MR)-dual connectivity (DC) in association with a master node (MN); receive, from the UE via signalling radio bearer type 3 (SRB3), an indication of a radio link failure on the MN; and forward the indication to the MN.
7. The one or more NTCRM of claim 6, wherein the MN is a different radio access technology (RAT) than the SN.
8. The one or more NTCRM of claim 6, wherein the indication is received and forwarded in a failure indication message format that is used for split signalling radio bearer type 1 (SRB1).
9. The one or more NTCRM of claim 6, wherein the instructions, when executed, are further to cause the SN to: receive a reconfiguration message or recovery message from the MN; and forward the reconfiguration message or recovery message to the UE over SRB3, wherein the reconfiguration message or recovery message is a same reconfiguration message or recovery message format that is sent over a split SRB1.
10. The one or more NTCRM of claim 9, wherein the failure indication message and the reconfiguration message or recovery message are tunneled transparently by the SN between the MN and the UE over SRB3.
