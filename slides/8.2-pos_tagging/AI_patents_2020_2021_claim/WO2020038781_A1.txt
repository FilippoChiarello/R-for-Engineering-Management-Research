<title>
BIOMETRIC MEASUREMENT AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure describes imaging systems configured to determine the accuracy of anatomical measurements obtained from image data. Systems may include an ultrasound transducer configured to acquire echo signals responsive to ultrasound pulses transmitted toward a target region. Systems can also include a graphical user interface configured to display a biometry tool widget, such as a caliper, for acquiring a measurement of an anatomical feature within the target region from at least one image frame generated from the ultrasound echoes. Systems can also include one or more processors configured to determine a confidence metric indicative of the accuracy of the measurement. The processors can also be configured to cause the graphical user interface to display a graphical indicator corresponding to the confidence metric. The processors can implement one or more neural networks, and can derive additional information, such as gestational age or weight, from the anatomical measurements acquired.

<claims>
What is claimed is:
1. An ultrasound imaging system comprising:
an ultrasound transducer configured to acquire echo signals responsive to ultrasound pulses transmitted toward a target region;
a graphical user interface configured to display a biometry tool widget for acquiring a measurement of an anatomical feature within the target region from at least one image frame generated from the ultrasound echoes; and
one or more processors in communication with the ultrasound transducer and configured to:
determine a confidence metric indicative of an accuracy of the measurement; and cause the graphical user interface to display a graphical indicator corresponding to the confidence metric.
2. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 1, wherein the processors are configured to determine the confidence metric by inputting the at least one image frame into a first neural network trained with imaging data comprising the anatomical feature.
3. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 2, wherein the processors are further configured to determine the confidence metric by inputting a patient statistic, a prior measurement of the anatomical feature, a derived measurement based on the prior measurement, a probability that the image frame contains an anatomical landmark associated with the anatomical feature, a quality level of the image frame, a setting of the ultrasound transducer, or combinations thereof, into the first neural network.
4. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 3, wherein the probability that the image frame contains the anatomical landmark indicates whether a correct imaging plane has been obtained for measuring the anatomical feature.
5. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 1 , wherein the graphical user interface is not physically coupled to the ultrasound transducer.
6. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 3, wherein the derived measurement comprises a gestational age or an age-adjusted risk of a chromosomal abnormality.
7. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 3, wherein the patient statistic comprises a maternal age, a patient weight, a patient height, or combinations thereof.
8. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 3, wherein the quality level of the image frame is based on a distance of the anatomical feature from the ultrasound transducer, an orientation of the biometry tool widget relative to the ultrasound transducer, a distance of a beam focus region to the anatomical feature, a noise estimate obtained via frequency analysis, or combinations thereof.
9. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 1, wherein the processors are further configured to:
apply a threshold to the confidence metric to determine whether the measurement should be re-acquired; and
cause the graphical user interface to display an indication of whether measurement should be re-acquired.
10. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 1, wherein the biometry tool widget comprises a caliper, a trace tool, an ellipse tool, a curve tool, an area tool, a volume tool, or combinations thereof.
11. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 1, wherein the anatomical feature is a feature associated with a fetus or a uterus.
12. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 1, wherein the processors are further configured to determine a gestational age and/or a weight estimate based on the measurement.
13. The ultrasound imaging system of claim 2, wherein the first neural network comprises a multilayer perceptron network configured to perform supervised learning with stochastic dropout, or an autoencoder network configured to generate a compressed representation of the image frame and the measurement, and compare the compressed representation to a manifold of population-based data.
14. A method of ultrasound imaging, the method comprising:
acquiring echo signals responsive to ultrasound pulses transmitted into a target region by a transducer operatively coupled to an ultrasound system;
displaying a biometry tool widget for acquiring a measurement of an anatomical feature within the target region from at least one image frame generated from the ultrasound echoes; determining a confidence metric indicative of an accuracy of the measurement; and causing the graphical user interface to display a graphical indicator corresponding to the confidence metric.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein determining the confidence metric comprises inputting the at least one image frame into a first neural network trained with imaging data comprising the anatomical feature.
16. The method of claim 15, further comprising inputting a patient statistic, a prior measurement of the anatomical feature, a derived measurement based on the prior measurement, a probability that the image frame contains an anatomical landmark associated with the anatomical feature, a quality level of the image frame, a setting of the ultrasound transducer, or combinations thereof, into the first neural network.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein the patient statistic comprises a maternal age, a patient weight, a patient height, or combinations thereof.
18. The method of claim 16, wherein the derived measurement comprises a gestational age or an age-adjusted risk of a chromosomal abnormality.
19. The method of claim 14, further comprising determining a gestational age and/or a weight estimate based on the measurement.
20. A non-transitory computer-readable medium comprising executable instructions, which when executed cause a processor of a medical imaging system to perform any of the methods of claims 14-19.
