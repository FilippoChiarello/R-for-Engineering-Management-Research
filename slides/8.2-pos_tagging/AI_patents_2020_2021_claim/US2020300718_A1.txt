FLEXIBLE CIRCUIT DESIGN FOR MONITORING PHYSICAL BODIES
</title>

<abstract>
A flexible circuit may be provided that allows for the monitoring of a physical object. The flexible circuit includes a plurality of flexible conductive segments that are disposed in a geometric pattern. The flexible conductive segments include nodes, and the physical object is monitored by analyzing changes in electrical resistance in the conductive segments between the nodes. The flexible circuit may also include sensors disposed on the nodes for monitoring additional conditions. A processor monitors the flexible conductive segments and sensors, and may provide an output regarding the status of the physical object.
