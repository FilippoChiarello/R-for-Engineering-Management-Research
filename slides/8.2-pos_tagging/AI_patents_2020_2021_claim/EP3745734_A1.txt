<abstract>
This disclosure discloses a method and an apparatus for processing a multimedia file, a storage medium, and an electronic apparatus. The method includes: obtaining, by a transcoding device, a source slice media file in a to-be-processed source multimedia file; obtaining, by the transcoding device, a slice pre-processing result matching the source slice media file, the slice pre-processing result being used for indicating a storage address of an image area processing result, matching the source slice media file, in a pre-processing device; obtaining, by the transcoding device, the image area processing result matching the source slice media file from the storage address; and processing, by the transcoding device, the source slice media file according to the image area processing result, to obtain a processed target slice media file. By means of this disclosure, a technical problem of relatively low processing efficiency in a method for processing a multimedia file in the related art is resolved.
