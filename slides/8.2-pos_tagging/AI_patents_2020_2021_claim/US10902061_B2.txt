<title>
Content discovery using a skills graph
</title>

<abstract>
In one general aspect, a computer-implemented method can include receiving, by a computer system, a name for a course, receiving, by the computer system, a selection of a skill, storing, in a first database included in the computer system, the skill tagged to the course, creating a skills graph including tagged skills for a plurality of courses including the course, the skills graph providing a graph of a skills hierarchy for the course, storing, in a second database included in the computer system, the skills graph, receiving, by the computer system, a query for the skill, and in response to receiving the query, traversing the skills graph, the traversing identifying the skill as a tagged skill for at least the course, and based on identifying the skill as a tagged skill for the course, identifying the name for the course.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method comprising: receiving, by a computer system, a name for an online course stored in a linear scalable database; identifying a skill taught by the online course; tagging the skill to the named online course; constructing a skills graph including tagged skills for a plurality of online courses stored in the linear scalable database including the named online course, the skilled graph connecting the tagged skills to each other and to online course content, the skills graph being a series of vertices and edges, an edge between a skill vertex and an online course content vertex representing a relevancy of the tagged skill represented by the skill vertex, the skills graph including a graph of a skills hierarchy for the plurality of online courses; storing the skills graph; receiving, by the computer system, a query for a specific skill; in response to receiving the query, discovering online course content corresponding to the specific skill by traversing the skills graph, the traversing identifying the specific skill as the tagged skill for at least the named online course; based on identifying the specific skill as the tagged skill for the named online course, identifying the name for the course; and presenting the named online course over a communication network to teach the specific skill to a learner.
2. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein traversing the skills graph further comprises creating an ordered list of online courses included in the plurality of online courses that are tagged with the specific skill.
3. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein traversing the skills graph further comprises creating an ordered list of at least one of modules, lessons, or videos for the named online course that teaches the specific skill.
4. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising, in response to receiving the query, creating a profile for the specific skill.
5. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising, in response to receiving the query, identifying other skills related to the specific skill.
6. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, further comprising, in response to receiving the query, identifying at least one prerequisite skill for mastering the specific skill.
7. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the skills graph is a directed acyclic graph.
8. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein the skills graph maps skills to course content.
9. The computer-implemented method of claim 1, wherein an edge of the skills graph is directed from a first vertex to a second vertex, and wherein the edge of the skills graph has an associated relevancy score indicating a relevancy of a skill represented by the first vertex relative to a skill represented by the second vertex.
10. A non-transitory, machine-readable medium having instructions stored thereon, the instructions, when executed by a processor, cause a computer system to: receive a name for an online course, the named online course being one of a plurality of online courses stored in a linear scalable database; identify a skill taught by the named online course; tagging the skill to the named online course; construct a skills graph including tagged skills for the plurality of online courses including the named online course stored in the linear scalable database, the skilled graph connecting the tagged skills to each other and to online course content, the skills graph being a series of vertices and edges, an edge between a skill vertex and an online course content vertex representing a relevancy of the tagged skill represented by the skill vertex, the skills graph including a graph of a skills hierarchy for the plurality of online courses; storing the skills graph; receive, by the computer system, a query for a specific skill; in response to receiving the query, discover online course content corresponding to the specific skill by traversing the skills graph, the traversing identifying the specific skill as the tagged skill for at least the named online course; based on the identifying the specific skill as the tagged skill for the named online course, identify the name for the named online course; and present the named online course over a communication network to teach the specific skill to a learner.
11. The non-transitory, machine-readable medium of claim 10, wherein the instructions that cause the computer system to traverse the skills graph further include instructions that cause the computer system to create an ordered list of courses included in the plurality of courses that are tagged with the specific skill.
12. The non-transitory, machine-readable medium of claim 10, wherein an edge of the skills graph is directed from a first vertex to a second vertex, and wherein the edge of the skills graph has an associated relevancy score indicating a relevancy of a skill represented by the first vertex relative to a skill represented by the second vertex.
13. The non-transitory, machine-readable medium of claim 10, wherein the skills graph maps skills to course content.
14. The non-transitory, machine-readable medium of claim 10, wherein the skills graph is a directed acyclic graph.
