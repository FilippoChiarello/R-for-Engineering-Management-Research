IMAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM AND COMPUTER PROGRAM FOR PERFORMING IMAGE PROCESSING
</title>

<abstract>
An object of the present invention is to achieve both suppression of data amount of an image processing system that learns a collation image to be used for image identification using a discriminator and improvement of identification performance of the discriminator. In order to achieve the above object, there is proposed an image processing system including a discriminator that identifies an image using a collation image, the image processing system further including a machine learning engine that performs machine learning of collation image data required for image identification. The machine learning engine searches for a successfully identified image using an image for which identification has been failed, and adds information, obtained based on a partial image of the image for which identification has been failed and which has been selected by an input device to the successfully identified image obtained by the search to generate corrected collation image data.

<claims>
1. An image processing system comprising an arithmetic processing device that identifies an image using a collation image, the image processing system including: a display device that displays the image; an input device that selects a part of the image; a memory that stores collation image data to identify the image; and a machine learning engine that performs machine learning of the collation image data required for image identification of the arithmetic processing device, wherein the machine learning engine uses an image for which identification by the arithmetic processing device has failed to search an image which has been successfully identified by the arithmetic processing device and stored in the memory, and adds information, obtained based on a partial image of the image for which identification has failed and which has been selected by the input device, to the successfully identified image obtained by the search to generate corrected collation image data.
2. The image processing system according to claim 1, wherein the arithmetic processing device obtains a difference between a partial image selected by the input device and a corresponding image of the successfully identified image, which corresponds to the partial image, and the machine learning engine uses information on the difference to generate the corrected collation image data.
3. The image processing system according to claim 1, wherein the arithmetic processing device uses design data corresponding to the image for which identification has failed to execute search of the successfully identified image.
4. The image processing system according to claim 1, wherein the arithmetic processing device calculates a contrast difference, a luminance value difference, a noise difference between the partial image of the image for which identification has failed and the successfully identified image, and sets additional information to generate the corrected collation image data based on the difference calculation results.
5. The image processing system according to claim 1, wherein the display device displays a partial image of the image for which identification has failed and which has been selected by the input device, and the successfully identified image obtained by the search in a superimposed manner.
6. The image processing system according to claim 1, wherein the input device designates the partial images at a plurality of points in units of pixels from the image for which identification has failed.
7. The image processing system according to claim 1, wherein when a plurality of images which have been successfully identified are obtained as a result of the search of the successfully identified image by the arithmetic processing device, the machine learning engine uses a successfully identified image selected by an input of the input device to generate the corrected collation image.
8. The image processing system according to claim 1, wherein when no image is found as a result of the search of the successfully identified image, the arithmetic processing device displays a fact that no image is found on the display device.
9. The image processing system according to claim 1, wherein when no image is found as a result of the search, the machine learning engine displays the image for which identification has failed and enables an input of information to generate the corrected collation image data by the input device.
10. A computer-readable recording medium storing a computer command to be executed by a processor, the computer command causing the processor: to execute search of data of an image to be collated which has been successfully identified using data of a collation image by using data of an image to be collated for which the identification using the data of the collation image has failed in order to generate learning data of a discriminator that identifies the image to be collated using the collation image; and to add information, obtained by partially selecting the image to be collated for which identification has failed, to the data of the image to be collated, which has been successfully identified and obtained by the search, to generate corrected collation image data.
11. The computer-readable recording medium storing the computer command to be executed by the processor according to claim 10, wherein the computer command causes the processor to obtain a difference between a partial image selected from the image to be collated for which identification has failed and a corresponding image of the successfully identified image to be collated, which corresponds to the partial image, and the machine learning engine uses information on the difference to generate the corrected collation image data.
