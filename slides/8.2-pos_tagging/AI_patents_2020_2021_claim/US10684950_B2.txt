System for triggering cross channel data caching
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the present invention provide a system for triggering cross channel data caching. Historical event data and live event data of a user may be monitored to determine an expected event that comprises one or more expected channels. An expected period of time for the expected event may also be determined. Relevant user data may then be identified from one or more systems of record and cached or otherwise compressed. One or more adapters configured to format cached data into the one or more expected channels are then identified. The cached data is then transmitted to databases associated with each of the one or more expected channels, where the cached data is converted by the adapters. The cached data is then generally maintained in these databases for the expected period of time.

<claims>
1. A computer implemented method for triggering cross channel data caching, said computer implemented method comprising: providing a computing system comprising a computer processing device and a non-transitory computer readable medium, where the computer readable medium comprises configured computer program instruction code, such that when said instruction code is operated by said computer processing device, said computer processing device performs the following operations: monitoring historical event data of a customer and live event data of the customer; determining an expected event based on the historical event data of the customer and the live event data of the customer, wherein the expected event comprises one or more expected channels, wherein determining the expected event further comprises determining an expected event period of time that is a period of time that the customer is likely to interact with a managing entity through one or more of the channels, and wherein each of the one or more expected channels comprises communication channels, portals, customer support systems, automated teller machines, or electronic kiosks that facilitate communication between the customer and the managing entity; identifying, from one or more systems of record, a set of data associated with the customer, based on the expected event; caching the set of data associated with the customer to generate a set of cached data; identifying one or more adapters configured to format the set of cached data into formats compatible with each of the one or more expected channels; transmitting the set of cached data to a database associated with each of the one or more expected channels, wherein the set of cached data is converted into the formats compatible with each of the one or more expected channels by the identified one or more adapters; and maintaining the set of cached data in each database associated with each of the one or more expected channels for the expected event period of time.
2. The computer implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: determining that the expected event period of time has concluded; determining that the expected event is not occurring; and in response to determining that the expected event period of time has concluded, and in response to determining that the expected event is not occurring, deleting the set of cached data from each database associated with each of the one or more expected channels.
3. The computer implemented method of claim 1, further comprising: determining that the expected event is occurring; determining that the expected event period of time period has concluded; and maintaining the set of cached data in each database associated with each of the one or more expected channels for at least as long as the expected event is occurring.
4. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein determining the expected event further comprises determining an expected event period of time for each of the one or more expected channels.
5. The computer implemented method of claim 1, wherein the expected event comprises an expectation that the customer will access an online portal while in a foreign geographic region; wherein a first channel of the one or more expected channels comprises the online portal linked to a first database located in the foreign geographic region; and wherein transmitting the set of cached data to each database associated with each of the one or more expected channels comprises transmitting the set of cached data to the first database.
6. A computer program product for triggering cross channel data caching, the computer program product comprising at least one non-transitory computer readable medium comprising computer readable instructions, the instructions comprising instructions for: monitoring historical event data of a customer and live event data of the customer; determining an expected event based on the historical event data of the customer and the live event data of the customer, wherein the expected event comprises one or more expected channels, wherein determining the expected event further comprises determining an expected event period of time that is a period of time that the customer is likely to interact with a managing entity through one or more channels, and wherein each of the one or more expected channels comprises communication channels, portals, customer support systems, automated teller machines, or electronic kiosks that facilitate communication between the customer and the managing entity; identifying, from one or more systems of record, a set of data associated with the customer, based on the expected event; caching the set of data associated with the customer to generate a set of cached data; identifying one or more adapters configured to format the set of cached data into formats compatible with each of the one or more expected channels; transmitting the set of cached data to a database associated with each of the one or more expected channels, wherein the set of cached data is converted into the formats compatible with each of the one or more expected channels by the identified one or more adapters, and maintaining the set of cached data in each database associated with each of the one or more expected channels for the expected event period of time.
7. The computer program product of claim 6, wherein the computer readable instructions further comprise instructions for: determining that the expected event period of time has concluded; determining that the expected event is not occurring; and in response to determining that the expected event period of time has concluded, and in response to determining that the expected event is not occurring, deleting the set of cached data from each database associated with each of the one or more expected channels.
8. The computer program product of claim 6, wherein the computer readable instructions further comprise instructions for: determining that the expected event is occurring; determining that the expected event period of time period has concluded; and maintaining the set of cached data in each database associated with each of the one or more expected channels for at least as long as the expected event is occurring.
9. The computer program product of claim 6, wherein determining the expected event further comprises determining an expected event period of time for each of the one or more expected channels.
10. The computer program product of claim 6, wherein the expected event comprises an expectation that the customer will access an online portal while in a foreign geographic region; wherein a first channel of the one or more expected channels comprises the online portal linked to a first database located in the foreign geographic region; and wherein transmitting the set of cached data to each database associated with each of the one or more expected channels comprises transmitting the set of cached data to the first database.
