INFORMATION BARRIERS FOR SENSITIVE INFORMATION
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are embodiments for information barriers that are conditional on the type of information being communicated. Information barrier polices provided by the disclosed embodiments selectively allow communication between accounts or groups based on characteristics of the content of the communication. For example, communication between a marketing department and an engineering department may be conditional on the communication not including any sensitive information. The determination of whether the communication includes sensitive information is further designed to provide good performance even in environments that maintain substantial portions of data in an offsite or cloud environment, where latencies associated with searching large datastores can be prohibitive.
