DATA ACCESSING METHOD AND APPARATUS, DEVICE AND MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a data accessing method and apparatus, a device, and a computer-readable storage medium, and relate to a computer field. The data accessing method includes: obtaining (202) an identification of a virtual function corresponding to a virtual machine of a computing device and an address related to data in a memory to be accessed by the virtual machine, in which the identification of the virtual function and the address are determined based on an access request received from the virtual machine of the computing device; determining (204) a range of storage resource in the memory corresponding to the virtual machine based on the identification; determining (206) whether the address is within the range; and in response to determining that the address is within the range, accessing (208) the data related to the address.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A data accessing method, comprising: obtaining (202) an identification of a virtual function corresponding to a virtual machine of a computing device and an address related to data in a memory to be accessed by the virtual machine, wherein the identification of the virtual function and the address are determined based on an access request received from the virtual machine of the computing device; determining (204) a range of storage resource in the memory corresponding to the virtual machine based on the identification; determining (206) whether the address is within the range; and in response to determining that the address is within the range, accessing (208) the data related to the address.
2. The method according to claim 1, further comprising:
in response to determining that the address is not within the range, returning an error message.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein the error message indicates a decoding error.
4. The method according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein accessing (208) the data related to the address comprises: determining (302) a starting physical address of the storage resource based on the identification; determining (304) a physical storage address corresponding to the address based on the starting physical address and the address; and accessing (306) the data corresponding to the physical storage address.
5. The method according to one of claims 1 to 4, further comprising:in response to receiving a request for setting a mapping relation between the identification and the range of the storage resource transmitted through a physical function, storing the mapping relation in a register related to the memory.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein the method is implemented on a system-on-a-chip (SoC) communicatively coupled with the computing device.
7. A data accessing apparatus (500), comprising: an obtaining module (502), configured to obtain an identification of a virtual function corresponding to a virtual machine of a computing device and an address related to data in a memory to be accessed by the virtual machine, wherein the identification of the virtual function and the address are determined based on an access request from the virtual machine of the computing device; a range determining module (504), configured to determine a range of storage resource in the memory corresponding to the virtual machine based on the identification; an address comparison module (506), configured to determine whether the address is within the range; and a first access module (508), configured to in response to determining that the address is within the range, access the data related to the address.
8. The apparatus (500) according to claim 7, further comprising:
a returning module, configured to return an error message in response to determining that the address is not within the range.
9. The apparatus (500) according to claim 8, wherein the error message indicates a decoding error.
10. The apparatus (500) according to one of claims 7 to 9, wherein the first access module (508) comprises: a starting physical address determining module, configured to determine a starting physical address of the storage resource based on the identification; a physical storage address determining module, configured to determine a physical storage address corresponding to the address based on the starting physical address and the address; and a second access module, configured to access the data corresponding to the physical storage address.
11. The apparatus (500) according to one of claims 7 to 10, further comprising:
a storage module, configured to store the mapping relation in a register related to the memory in response to receiving a request for setting a mapping relation between the identification and the range of storage resource transmitted through a physical function.
12. The apparatus (500) according to one of claims 7 to 11, wherein the apparatus (500) is on a system-on-a-chip (SoC) communicatively coupled with the computing device.
13. An electronic device, comprises: one or more processors; and a storage device for storing one or more programs, wherein when the one or more programs are executed by the one or more processors, the one or more processors are caused to implement the method according to any one of claims 1-6.
14. A computer-readable storage medium having a computer program stored thereon that, when executed by a processor, the method according to any one of claims 1-6 is implemented.
