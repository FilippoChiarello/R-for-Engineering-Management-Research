Detection of disease conditions and comorbidities
</title>

<abstract>
A new computational approach may provide improved detection of disease conditions and comorbidities, such as PTSD, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, depression, etc. For example, in an embodiment, a computer-implemented method for detecting a disease condition may comprise receiving a plurality of data streams, each data stream representing a measurement of a brain activity comprising physical and chemical phenomena and performing pattern analysis on the plurality of data streams to detect at least one fundamental code unit of a brain code corresponding to a disease condition based on a combination of the plurality of data streams.

<claims>
1. A method for detecting a disease condition, implemented in a computer system comprising a processor, memory accessible by the processor, and computer program instructions stored in the memory and executable by the processor, the method comprising: measuring, at the computer system a plurality of measurements of physical and chemical phenomena relating to a person, using at least a plurality of electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring to form an EEG data stream, behavioral tracking using video cameras and depth sensors to track human activity and using software analysis to form a data stream representing determined human behaviors, facial feature analysis using video cameras to track facial characteristic points of human expressions and using software analysis to form a data stream representing determined facial expressions, emotional state and cognitive state, language analysis using detected speech and vocal impairments and mappings of words and using software analysis to form a data stream representing determined emotional state and cognitive state, and body movement using a sensor network and using software analysis to form a data stream representing movements of body parts; integrating the plurality of data streams to form a multi-level data stream by performing pattern analysis on each of the plurality of data streams to detect patterns in each data stream corresponding to cognitive states or disease conditions, and correlating the detected patterns corresponding to cognitive states or disease conditions in all of the data streams to form an indication of a cognitive state or a disease condition based on all of the data streams; constructing a wavelet function representing the patterns in each of the plurality of data streams corresponding to the cognitive state or the disease condition for each of the plurality of data streams; and constructing another wavelet function representing the indication of the cognitive state or the disease condition for the integrated data stream to form at least one fundamental code unit of a brain code corresponding to the cognitive state or the disease condition.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the pattern analysis comprises detecting patterns using at least one of language analysis using machine learning, syntactic structure identification, multilayered perceptron neural networks, machine translation processes, case-based reasoning, analogy-based reasoning, speech-based cognitive assessment, mind default axiology, mood state indicator, linguistic-axiological input/output, and mind default axiology.
3. A computer program product for detecting a disease condition, the computer program product comprising a non-transitory computer readable storage having program instructions embodied therewith, the program instructions executable by a computer system comprising a processor, memory accessible by the processor, and computer program instructions stored in the memory and executable by the processor, to cause the computer system to perform a method comprising: measuring, at the computer system, a plurality of measurements of physical and chemical phenomena relating to a person, using at least a plurality of electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring to form an EEG data stream, behavioral tracking using video cameras and depth sensors to track human activity and using software analysis to form a data stream representing determined human behaviors, facial feature analysis using video cameras to track facial characteristic points of human expressions and using software analysis to form a data stream representing determined facial expressions, emotional state and cognitive state, language analysis using detected speech and vocal impairments and mappings of words and using software analysis to form a data stream representing determined emotional state and cognitive state, and body movement using a sensor network and using software analysis to form a data stream representing movements of body parts; integrating the plurality of data streams to form a multi-level data stream by performing pattern analysis on each of the plurality of data streams to detect patterns in each data stream corresponding to cognitive states or disease conditions, and correlating the detected patterns corresponding to cognitive states or disease conditions in all of the data streams to form an indication of a cognitive state or a disease condition based on all of the data streams; constructing a wavelet function representing the patterns in each of the plurality of data streams corresponding to the cognitive state or the disease condition for each of the plurality of data streams; and constructing another wavelet function representing the indication of the cognitive state or the disease condition for the integrated data stream to form at least one fundamental code unit of a brain code corresponding to a disease condition.
4. The computer program product of claim 3 wherein the pattern analysis comprises detecting patterns using at least one of language analysis using machine learning, syntactic structure identification, multilayered perceptron neural networks, machine translation processes, case-based reasoning, analogy-based reasoning, speech-based cognitive assessment, mind default axiology, mood state indicator, linguistic-axiological input/output, and mind default axiology.
5. A computer-implemented method system for detecting a disease condition comprising a processor, memory accessible by the processor, and computer program instructions stored in the memory and executable by the processor to perform: measuring a plurality of measurements of physical and chemical phenomena relating to a person, using at least a plurality of electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring to form an EEG data stream, behavioral tracking using video cameras and depth sensors to track human activity and using software analysis to form a data stream representing determined human behaviors, facial feature analysis using video cameras to track facial characteristic points of human expressions and using software analysis to form a data stream representing determined facial expressions, emotional state and cognitive state, language analysis using detected speech and vocal impairments and mappings of words and using software analysis to form a data stream representing determined emotional state and cognitive state, and body movement using a sensor network and using software analysis to form a data stream representing movements of body parts; integrating the plurality of data streams to form a multi-level data stream by performing pattern analysis on each of the plurality of data streams to detect patterns in each data stream corresponding to cognitive states or disease conditions, and correlating the detected patterns corresponding to cognitive states or disease conditions in all of the data streams to form an indication of a cognitive state or a disease condition based on all of the data streams; constructing a wavelet function representing the patterns in each of the plurality of data streams corresponding to the cognitive state or the disease condition for each of the plurality of data streams; and constructing another wavelet function representing the indication of the cognitive state or the disease condition for the integrated data stream to form unit at least one fundamental code unit of a brain code corresponding to the cognitive state or the disease condition.
6. The method of claim 5 wherein the pattern analysis comprises detecting patterns using at least one of language analysis using machine learning, syntactic structure identification, multilayered perceptron neural networks, machine translation processes, case-based reasoning, analogy-based reasoning, speech-based cognitive assessment, mind default axiology, mood state indicator, linguistic-axiological input/output, and mind default axiology.
