SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING VISUAL ANALYTICS AND PLAYER STATISTICS
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method described herein is effective for generating automated visual analytics and player statistics for videos of sporting events. A dataset of videos is collected that comprises multiple teams. Training the networks on RGB and grayscale images affects the generalization ability of the network learned and augmenting more images using generative adversarial networks to the dataset helps further improves the performance.

<claims>
1. A system for automatically generating visual analytics for players in a sport, comprising: a processor; a storage device for storing a dataset of a plurality of videos of the players playing the sport; a set of executable instructions executable on the processor configured to localize and track the players from the videos and identify each of the players; and a deep convolutional generative adversarial network configured to determine which of the identified players control a ball and generate visual analytics describing the players that control the ball to generate performance statistics for each player controlling the ball.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the performance statistics include a duration time that each player controls the ball.
3. The system of claim 1, further comprising a low-pass filter to smooth transition between different players controlling the ball to reduce misclassification.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the deep convolutional generative adversarial network further comprises two deep convolutional neural networks, a generator G and a discriminator D trained against each other, wherein the generator takes a random noise vector, z, and returns an image, Xgen=G(z), wherein the discriminator takes a real or a generated image, and outputs a probability distribution P(S|X)=D(X) over the two image sources, wherein the discriminator is trained to maximize a log-likelihood of assigning a correct source while G tries to minimize it, wherein the optimization function V is given by: wherein the two networks converge to a Nash equilibrium so that D is maximally confused and G generates samples that resemble the training data.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the deep convolutional generative adversarial network is further configured to replace pooling layers with convolutional layers for both the generator and discriminator using batch normalization after convolutional layers, ReLU activation in the generator and Leaky ReLU in the discriminator.
6. The system of claim 5, further comprising a generator and discriminator network to learn to generate images that resemble players with the ball.
7. A method for automatically generating visual analytics for players in a sport, comprising: storing a dataset of a plurality of videos of the players playing the sport; executing instructions on the processor configured to localize and track the players from the videos and identify each of the players; and executing a deep convolutional generative adversarial network configured to determine which of the identified players control a ball and generate visual analytics describing the players that control the ball to generate performance statistics for each player controlling the ball.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the performance statistics include a duration time that each player controls the ball.
9. The method of claim 7, further comprising using a low-pass filter to smooth transition between different players controlling the ball to reduce misclassification.
10. The system of claim 7, wherein the deep convolutional generative adversarial network further comprises two deep convolutional neural networks, a generator G and a discriminator D trained against each other, wherein the generator takes a random noise vector, z, and returns an image, Xgen=G(z), wherein the discriminator takes a real or a generated image, and outputs a probability distribution P(S|X)=D(A) over the two image sources, wherein the discriminator is trained to maximize a log-likelihood of assigning a correct source while G tries to minimize it, wherein the optimization function V is given by: wherein the two networks converge to a Nash equilibrium so that D is maximally confused and G generates samples that resemble the training data.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the deep convolutional generative adversarial network is further configured to replace pooling layers with convolutional layers for both the generator and discriminator using batch normalization after convolutional layers, ReLU activation in the generator and Leaky ReLU in the discriminator.
12. The method of claim 11, further comprising using a generator and discriminator network to learn to generate images that resemble players with the ball.
