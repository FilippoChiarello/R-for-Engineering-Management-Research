SYSTEMS FOR FAST AND/OR EFFICIENT PROCESSING OF DECISION NETWORKS, AND RELATED METHODS AND APPARATUS
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the subject disclosure may include, for example, a technique for processing a decision network that includes obtaining an index encoding a mapping from potential values of an input parameter to decision parameters of the network's predicates, wherein the mapping associates potential values of the input parameter with decision parameters affected by those potential values; evaluating decision parameters affected by specified values of the input parameter, including identifying each decision parameter to which the index maps at least one specified values of the input parameter, and setting the values of those decision parameters in accordance with the input parameter's specified values; and analyzing the decision network, including evaluating the predicates of one or more of the decision nodes based on the values of the predicates' decision parameters, and determining, based on the values of the evaluated predicates and a topology of the decision network, that a particular terminal node encodes the network's output. Other embodiments are disclosed.
