A METHOD OF DIAGNOSING CANCER BASED ON LIPIDOMIC ANALYSIS OF A BODY FLUID
</title>

<abstract>
A method of diagnosing cancer based on lipidomic analysis of a body fluid taken from the body of a patient is disclosed. The method includes the steps of spiking of the sample with a set of internal standards having at least one internal standard for each lipid class present in the sample, subsequently processing the sample by liquid-liquid lipidomic extraction or by solid phase lipidomic extraction, measurement of the processed sample by a mass spectrometry method, determining concentrations for at least 51, more preferably for all lipids present at a level above detection threshold of the mass spectrometry method, statistical evaluation of the determined concentrations of the lipids, the statistical evaluation determining the level of probability of the patient suffering from cancer, or optionally from a specific type of cancer.
