Fraud detection system in a casino
</title>

<abstract>
A fraud detection system which detects fraud in a game of performing collection and redemption of chips in accordance with a win or lose result includes a camera which captures an image of chips contained in a chip tray of a dealer, an image analyzing apparatus which analyses the image captured by the camera to detect an amount of the chips contained in the chip tray, a card distribution device which determines a win or lose result of a game, and a control device which compares the win or lose result of the game and the amount of the chips contained in the chip tray before and after collection and redemption of the chips to detect fraud.

<claims>
1. A chip management system in a casino having a plurality of tables, the chip management system comprising: a chip tray provided to one of the gaming tables to hold chips, wherein chips wagered by losing players are temporarily kept in a collection chip area; at least one RFID reader that is configured to read respective radio-frequency identifications (RFID) buried in respective ones of the chips held in the chip tray and buried in respective ones of the chips temporarily kept in the collection chip area; a win/lose result determination device that determines a win or lose result of a game; and a control device, wherein the control device is configured to: using a reading result of the at least one RFID reader, separately determine (a) a total amount of the chips held in the chip tray and (b) an amount of the chips in the collection chip area; determine a respective position, a respective type, and a respective number of chips wagered by each of at least one player; determine an amount of chips to be collected in the game based on (a) the position, type, and number of chips wagered by each of the at least one player and (b) the win or lose result; and compare the determined amount of chips to be collected in the game and an actual amount of chips collected into the collection chip area to determine whether or not there is difference between the amount of chips to be collected in the game and the actual amount of chips.
2. The chip management system according to claim 1, further comprising: a game recording device that records images of the game, which is executed on one of the gaming tables; an image analyzing device that analyzes the images recorded by the game recording device.
3. The chip management system according to claim 2, wherein the collection chip area is included in the chip tray as a collection chip tray.
4. The chip management system according to claim 1, wherein the collection chip area is included in the chip tray as a collection chip tray.
5. A chip management system in a casino having a plurality of tables, the chip management system comprising: a chip tray provided to one of the gaming tables to hold chips, wherein chips wagered by losing players are temporarily kept in a collection chip area; at least one RFID reader that is configured to read respective radio-frequency identifications (RFID) buried in respective ones of the chips held in the chip tray and buried in respective ones of the chips temporarily kept in the collection chip area; a game recording device that records an image of the collection chip area using a camera; an image analyzing device that analyzes the image of the collection chip area recorded by the game recording device; and a control device, wherein the control device is configured to: using a reading result of the at least one RFID reader, separately determine (a) at least one of a total amount and a total number of the chips held in the chip tray and (b) at least one of an amount and a total of the chips in the collection chip area; and determine: whether or not there is difference between the number of chips in the collection chip area obtained using the reading result of the RFID reader and a number of chips in the collection chip area obtained by the image analyzing device, or whether or not there is difference between the amount of chips in the collection chip area obtained using the reading result of the RFID reader and an amount of chips in the collection chip area obtained by the image analyzing device.
6. The chip management system according to claim 5, wherein the collection chip area is included in the chip tray as a collection chip tray.
7. A fraud detection system in a casino having a plurality of gaming table, comprising: a collection chip area used for temporally keeping lost and collected chips wagered by lost players; an RFID reader that is configured to detect respective radio-frequency identifications (RFID) buried in respective ones of the chips held in the collection chip area; and a control device; wherein: the control device is configured to determine at least one of an actual amount and an actual number of lost and collected chips based on a reading result of the RFID reader; and one or both of the following: (1) the system further includes a win/lose result determination device that determines a win or lose result of a game, and the control device is further configured to: determine a respective position, a respective type, and a respective number of chips wagered by each of at least one player; determine an amount of chips to be collected in the game based on (a) the position, type, and number of chips wagered by each of the at least one player and (b) the win or lose result; and compare the determined amount of chips to be collected in the game and the actual amount of chips collected into the collection chip area to determine whether or not there is difference between the amount of chips to be collected in the game and the actual amount of chips; and (2) (a) the system further includes a game recording device that records an image of the collection chip area using a camera and an image analyzing device that analyzes the image of the collection chip area recorded by the game recording device, and (b) the control device is further configured to determine whether there is difference between the actual amount or actual number of chips in the collection chip area obtained using the reading result of the RFID reader and an amount or a number of chips in the collection chip area obtained by the image analyzing device.
8. The fraud detection system according to claim 7, wherein: the system includes the win/lose result determination device that determines the win or lose result of a game; and the control device is configured to: determine the respective position, respective type, and respective number of chips wagered by each of the at least one player; determine the amount of chips to be collected in the game based on (a) the position, type, and number of chips wagered by each of the at least one player and (b) the win or lose result; and perform the comparison between the determined amount of chips to be collected in the game and the actual amount of chips collected into the collection chip area.
9. The fraud detection system according to claim 7, wherein: the system includes the game recording device that records the image of the collection chip area using the camera and the image analyzing device that analyzes the image of the collection chip area recorded by the game recording device; and the control device is configured to determine whether there is the difference between the actual amount or actual number of chips in the collection chip area obtained using the reading result of the RFID reader and the amount or number of chips in the collection chip area obtained by the image analyzing device.
