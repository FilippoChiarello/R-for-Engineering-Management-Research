VISUAL SEARCH METHOD, COMPUTER DEVICE, AND STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
A visual search method, a computer device, and a non-transitory computer readable storage medium are provided. An ith image frame is received. The location and the classification of the subject in the ith image frame are extracted. A detection block corresponding to the subject is generated. In subsequent image frames of the ith image frame, the subject is tracked on the basis of the location of the subject in the ith image frame. The detection block is adjusted on the basis of the tracking result.

The method according to claim 1, further comprising: receiving an (i+M)th image frame, M being a positive integer; determining whether a subject in the (i+M)th image frame changes relative to the subject in the ith image frame; and in response to changing, regenerating a detection block according to the subject detected in the (i+M)th image frame, and re-tracking the subject in the (i+M)th image frame.
3. The method according to claim 1, wherein in the subsequent image frames of the it image frame, tracking the subject according to the location of the subject in the it image frame comprises: obtaining an (i+n)th image frame after the it image frame, n being a positive integer; and tracking the subject according to the location of the subject in the (i+n)th image frame.
4. The method according to claim 3, further comprising: obtaining image frames between the (i+1)th image frame and an (i+n−1)th image frame as reference image frames; and verifying the tracking of the subject according to the reference image frames.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein a plurality of subjects are comprised and a plurality of detection blocks are generated.
6. The method according to claim 1, wherein in the subsequent image frames of the ith image frame, tracking the subject according to the location of the subject in the ith image frame comprises: obtaining brightness of each subsequent image frame; in response to determining that a difference between the brightness of two adjacent image frames is greater than or equal to a first preset threshold, calling a kernelized correlation filters tracking algorithm to track the subject according to the location of the subject in the ith image frame; and in response to determining that a difference between the brightness of two adjacent image frames is less than the first preset threshold, calling an optical flow tracking algorithm to track the subject according to the location of the subject in the ith image frame.
