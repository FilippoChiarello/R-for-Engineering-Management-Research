<title>
DIGITAL 2D HOLOGRAPHIC SPECTROMETER FOR MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION
</title>

<abstract>
A tool including a dispersive spectrometer deployable within a wellbore is provided. The dispersive spectrometer includes a waveguide layer to detect electromagnetic radiation according to wavelength. The dispersive spectrometer also includes a plurality of detector elements disposed along the waveguide layer to detect electromagnetic radiation associated with a portion of the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation. A method for using the tool in a subterranean application is also provided.
