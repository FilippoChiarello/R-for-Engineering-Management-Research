<title>
Controlling aggregate signal amplitude from device arrays by segmentation and time-gating
</title>

<abstract>
High dynamic range resistive arrays are provided. An array of resistive elements provides a vector of current outputs equal to the analog vector-matrix product between (i) a vector of voltage inputs to the array encoding a vector of analog input values and (ii) a matrix of analog resistive weights within the array. First stage current mirrors are electrically coupled to a subset of the resistive elements through a local current accumulation wire. A second stage current mirror is electrically coupled to the first stage current mirrors through a global accumulation wire. Each of the first stage current mirrors includes at least one component having respective scaling factors selectable to scale up or down the current in the local current accumulation wire, thus controlling the aggregate current on the global accumulation wire.
