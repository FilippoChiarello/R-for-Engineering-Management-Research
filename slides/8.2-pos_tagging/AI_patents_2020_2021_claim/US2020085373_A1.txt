GLOVE
</title>

<abstract>
A glove is described to simultaneously, non-invasively, and continuously, over a period of time, monitor physiological parameters (e.g., blood pressure, blood glucose, oxygen saturation level, electrical activity of the heart, and/or heart rate) of a patient. A computing server that is either communicatively coupled to the glove or is a part of the glove uses the monitored physiological parameters to determine whether the patient has a physiological condition (e.g., hypotension, hypertension, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, hypoxia, hyperoxia, arrhythmia, a strong form of tachycardia, a mild form of tachycardia, and/or bradycardia). Related apparatuses, systems, methods, techniques and articles are also described.

<claims>
1. A glove comprising: an infrared sensor configured to be placed around the index finger of a patient, the infrared sensor configured to monitor blood glucose of the patient; a plurality of electrocardiograph connectors configured to monitor electrical activity of a heart of the patient when the electrocardiograph is placed close to the heart of the patient; and a cuff configured to use a pressure sensor monitor measure a systolic blood pressure and a diastolic blood pressure of the patient, the monitoring of the blood glucose, the electrical activity, the systolic blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure occurring simultaneously.
2. The glove of claim 1, wherein the blood glucose, the electrical activity, the systolic blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure are monitored non-invasively.
3. The glove of claim 1, further comprising one or more processors that are communicatively coupled to a computing server configured to diagnose physiological conditions based on monitored readings of the blood glucose, the electrical activity, the systolic blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure.
4. The glove of claim 3, wherein the one or more processors and the computing server are communicatively coupled to a communication device that executes a first application.
5. The glove of claim 4, wherein the first application displays the diagnosed physical conditions on a graphical user interface of the communication device.
6. The glove of claim 3, wherein the physiological conditions include two or more of hypotension, hypertension, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, hypoxia, hyperoxia, and arrhythmia.
7. The glove of claim 1, wherein the plurality of electrocardiograph connectors are three electrocardiograph connectors.
8. The glove of claim 1, wherein the infrared sensor measures the blood glucose over a period of time.
9. A system comprising: a glove configured to simultaneously and non-invasively monitor a plurality of physiological parameters of a patient; and a computing device executing an application configured to: receive, via a first communication network, readings of the plurality of physiological parameters; apply an algorithm on the readings to generate a diagnosis of one or more physiological conditions of the patient; and display the diagnosis on a display screen of the application.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein: the plurality of physiological parameters comprise two or more of blood pressure, blood glucose, oxygen saturation level, and electrical activity of the heart of the patient; and the one or more physiological conditions comprise one or more of hypotension, hypertension, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, hypoxia, hyperoxia, and arrhythmia.
11. The system of claim 10, wherein the generation of the diagnosis comprises generating a PQRST complex based on the electrical activity of the heart.
12. The system of claim 10, wherein the generation of the diagnosis comprises averaging the blood pressure over a preset period of time.
13. The system of claim 9, wherein the application is further configured to communicate with a computing server via a communication network to create a database of clinical data of the patient, the database being a part of the computing server.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the computing server is a cloud computing server.
15. A method comprising: simultaneously acquiring, by a glove worn by a patient, a plurality of readings of a plurality of physiological parameters from a patient; and transmitting, by a transmitter of the glove and via a communication network, the plurality of readings to an application executed on a computing device.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the plurality of physiological parameters comprise two or more of blood pressure, blood glucose, oxygen saturation level, electrical activity of the heart, and heart rate of the patient.
17. The method of claim 15, wherein the application displays one or more physiological conditions determined based on the plurality of physiological parameters, the one or more physiological conditions comprise one or more of hypotension, hypertension, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, hypoxia, hyperoxia, arrhythmia, a strong form of tachycardia, a mild form of tachycardia, and bradycardia.
