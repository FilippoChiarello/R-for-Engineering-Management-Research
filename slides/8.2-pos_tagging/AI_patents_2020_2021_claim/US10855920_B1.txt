POWER SUPPLYING AND IMAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM AND OPERATING METHOD THEREOF
</title>

<abstract>
A power supplying and image processing system adapted to a camera comprises a boost converter, an Ethernet power circuit, a signal conversion circuit, and a host. The boost converter receives an input power to boost and output thereof. The Ethernet power circuit receives the boosted power to output a DC device power to the camera, and forwards an image signal captured by the camera. The signal conversion circuit has a first interface and a second interface with different types, receives the image signal through the electrical connection between the first interface and the Ethernet power circuit, and converts a format of the image signal. The host obtains the format-converted image signal to perform an AI operation to generate a control signal to control operations of the camera or to show an image corresponding to the format-converted image signal the on a display device.
