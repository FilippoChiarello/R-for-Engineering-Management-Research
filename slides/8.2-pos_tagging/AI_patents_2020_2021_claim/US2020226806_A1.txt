<claims>
1. A display system of a wearable terminal, which is configured to display personal information about a person on a display board of a wearable terminal, comprising: an image acquisition unit, configured to acquire an image of a person entering a visual field of the wearable terminal; an identification unit, configured to identify the person by performing an image parsing on the image; a collection unit; configured to collect the personal information about the person; and a personal information display unit, configured to for the person seen through the display board, display the personal information as augmented reality on the display board of the wearable terminal, display the person and the personal information in different display manners, and switch on/off the display of the personal information.
2. The display system of claim 1, wherein the identification unit is configured to only identify a person located in a center of the visual field of the wearable terminal.
3. The display system of claim 1, wherein the collection unit is configured to collect the personal information about the person with reference to a database in which personal information is registered in advance.
4. The display system of claim 1, wherein the collection unit is configured to collect the personal information by accessing Web content associated with the person in advance.
5. The display system of claim 1, wherein the collection unit is configured to perform Internet retrieval of the person to collect the personal information from retrieved Web content.
6. The display system of claim 1, further comprising: a determination unit, configured to determine whether the displayed personal information is browsed; and a change unit, configured to change the personal information to a browsed state in response to determining that the personal information is browsed.
7. The display system of claim 1, further comprising: a determination unit, configured to determine whether the displayed personal information is browsed; and a change unit; configured to change a degree of attention in response to determining that the personal information is not browsed; so that the personal information is to be browsed.
8. The display system of claim 1, further comprising: a detection unit, configured to detect an action on the displayed personal information; and an action result display unit, configured to for the person seen through the display board, display a result according to the action as augmented reality on the display board of the wearable terminal.
9. The display system of claim 1, further comprising: a position direction acquisition unit; configured to acquire a terminal position and a capturing direction of the wearable terminal; and a prediction unit, configured to predict a person position of the person based on the terminal position and the capturing direction; wherein the identification unit is configured to identify the person according to the person position and the image parsing.
10. The display system of claim 1, further comprising: a guideline display unit, configured to display a guideline for capturing the person as augmented reality on the display board of the wearable terminal; wherein the acquisition unit is configured to acquire the image captured along the guideline.
11. The display system of claim 1, further comprising: a selection acceptance unit, configured to accept a selection of a selection target on the person seen through the display board of the wearable terminal; wherein the personal information display unit is configured to display person information, which is only matched with the selection target seen through the display board, as augmented reality on the display board of the wearable terminal.
12. A display method of a wearable terminal, configured to be implemented by a display system of a wearable terminal for displaying personal information about a person on a display board of the wearable terminal, comprising: an image acquisition step: acquiring an image of a person entering a visual field of the wearable terminal; an identification step: identifying the person by performing image parsing on the image; a collection step: collecting the personal information about the person; and a personal information display step: for the person seen through the display board, displaying the personal information as augmented reality on the display board of the wearable terminal, displaying the person and the personal information in different display manners, and switching on/off the display of the personal information.
13. A non-transitory storage medium for storing a computer-readable program, wherein the program, when executed by a processor, causes the processor to perform the following steps: an image acquisition step: acquiring an image of a person entering a visual field of a wearable terminal; an identification step: identifying the person by performing image parsing on the image; a collection step: collecting the personal information about the person; and a personal information display: for the person seen through the display board, displaying the personal information as augmented reality on the display board of the wearable terminal, displaying the person and the personal information in different display manners, and switching on/off the display of the personal information.
