Automated video detection and correction
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system for improving automated video detection and correction is provided. The method includes retrieving a portion of a video stream and dividing the portion into video frames and an audio file. The video frames and audio file are analyzed, and a speech polarity of the audio file is detected. Likewise, a visual action epicenter of the portion of the video stream is detected and a fade portion of the portion of the video stream is removed. An edited fade portion associated with the fade portion is generated and patched into the video stream. The edited fade portion patched into the video stream is presented via a display device.
