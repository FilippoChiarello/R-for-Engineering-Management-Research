SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTOMATED AGENT ASSISTANCE NEXT ACTIONS WITHIN A CLOUD-BASED CONTACT CENTER
</title>

<abstract>
Methods to reduce agent effort and improve customer experience quality through artificial intelligence. The Agent Assist tool provides contact centers with an innovative tool designed to reduce agent effort, improve quality and reduce costs by minimizing search and data entry tasks The Agent Assist tool is natively built and fully unified within the agent interface while keeping all data internally protected from third-party sharing.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: receiving a communication from a customer; automatically analyzing the communication to determine a subject for the customer's communication; automatically parsing a knowledgebase for at least one responsive answer to the subject associated with the customer's communication; providing the solution to an agent as a clickable link within a unified interface during the communication with the customer; and receiving selection of the clickable link to perform a subsequent action in response to the selection.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the communication is in textual form, the method further comprising: displaying text input by the customer in a first field of a unified interface; parsing the text input by the customer for key terms; querying the knowledgebase using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the knowledgebase as the solution in a second field in the unified interface.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the method is performed in real-time.
4. The method of 2, further comprising: querying a customer relationship management (CRM) platform/a customer service management (CSM) platform using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the CRM/CSM in the second field in the unified interface.
5. The method of claim 2, further comprising: querying a database of customer-agent transcripts using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the database of customer-agent transcripts in the second field in the unified interface.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving the communication as speech; converting the speech to text; determining intent from the text to ascertain the reason; and parsing the text for key terms.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising: querying the knowledgebase using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the knowledgebase as the solution in a second field in the unified interface.
8. The method of 6, further comprising: querying a customer relationship management (CRM) platform/a customer service management (CSM) platform using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the CRM/CSM in the second field in the unified interface.
9. The method of claim 6, further comprising: querying a database of customer-agent transcripts using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the database of customer-agent transcripts in the second field in the unified interface.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the subsequent action is performed in a second user interface to schedule an future interaction with the customer, parse the text to create notes regarding the customer communication, or escalate the customer communication to a supervisor.
11. A cloud-based software platform comprising: one or more computer processors; and one or more computer-readable mediums storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more computer processors, cause the cloud-based software platform to perform operations comprising: receiving a communication from a customer; automatically analyzing the communication to determine a subject for the customer's communication; automatically parsing a knowledgebase for at least one responsive answer to the subject associated with the customer's communication; providing the solution to an agent as a clickable link within a unified interface during the communication with the customer; and receiving selection of the clickable link to perform a subsequent action in response to the selection.
12. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, wherein the communication is in textual form, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising: displaying text input by the customer in a first field of a unified interface; parsing the text input by the customer for key terms; querying the knowledgebase using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the knowledgebase as the solution in a second field in the unified interface.
13. The cloud-based software platform of claim 12, wherein the operations are performed in real-time.
14. The cloud-based software platform of 12, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising: querying a customer relationship management (CRM) platform/a customer service management (CSM) platform using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the CRM/CSM in the second field in the unified interface.
15. The cloud-based software platform of claim 12, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising: querying a database of customer-agent transcripts using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the database of customer-agent transcripts in the second field in the unified interface.
16. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising: receiving the communication as speech; converting the speech to text; determining intent from the text to ascertain the reason; and parsing the text for key terms.
17. The cloud-based software platform of claim 16, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising: querying the knowledgebase using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the knowledgebase as the solution in a second field in the unified interface.
18. The cloud-based software platform of 16, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising: querying a customer relationship management (CRM) platform/a customer service management (CSM) platform using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the CRM/CSM in the second field in the unified interface.
19. The cloud-based software platform of claim 16, further comprising instructions to cause operations comprising: querying a database of customer-agent transcripts using the key terms; and displaying responsive results from the database of customer-agent transcripts in the second field in the unified interface.
20. The cloud-based software platform of claim 11, wherein the subsequent action is performed in a second user interface to schedule an future interaction with the customer, parse the text to create notes regarding the customer communication, or escalate the customer communication to a supervisor.
