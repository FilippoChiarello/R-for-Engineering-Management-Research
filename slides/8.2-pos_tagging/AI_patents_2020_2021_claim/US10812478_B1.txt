<title>
Methods and systems for verifying an identity of a user through contextual knowledge-based authentication
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems are described for verifying an identity of a user through contextual knowledge-based authentication. The system described uses contextual knowledge-based authentication. By verifying an identity of a user through contextual knowledge-based authentication, the verification is both more secure and more intuitive to the user. For example, by relying on confidential and/or proprietary information, the system may generate verification questions, the answers to which are known only by the user.
