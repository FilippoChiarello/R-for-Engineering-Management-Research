<title>
Tool for hyperparameter tuning
</title>

<abstract>
A computing device receives factor information indicating multiple factors (e.g., hyperparameters for designing a system comprising a machine learning algorithm). The computing device receives range information indicating initial ranges with a range for each of possible options for the multiple factors. The computing device obtains a space-filling design for the design space. The space-filing design indicates selected design points in the design space. Each of the selected design points represents assigned options assigned to the multiple factors. The assigned options are assigned from the initial ranges. The computing device generates, based on the space-filling design, an initial design suite that provides initial design cases corresponding to one or more of the selected design points. The computing device generates evaluations of the initial design cases. The computing device outputs, based on the evaluations of the initial design cases, an indication of a selected design case.
