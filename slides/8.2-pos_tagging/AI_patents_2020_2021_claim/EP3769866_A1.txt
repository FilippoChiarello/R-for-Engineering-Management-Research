DEVICES, SYSTEMS, AND METHODS FOR MONITORING A POWDER LAYER IN ADDITIVE ANUFACTURING ROCESSES
</title>

<abstract>
Devices, systems, and methods for monitoring a powder layer in additive manufacturing are disclosed. A method of monitoring a powder layer includes receiving image data corresponding the powder layer supported by a powder bed within a build chamber from imaging devices, determining leading and trailing regions of interest located adjacent to a leading end and a trailing end of the moving powder distributor, respectively, the leading and trailing regions of interest moving according to movement of the moving powder distributor, selecting at least one point located in the leading region of interest from the image data, determining first characteristics of the point, when the point is located within the trailing region of interest, determining second characteristics of the point, and comparing the first characteristics to the second characteristics.

<claims>
1. A method of monitoring a powder layer (112) distributed by a moving powder distributor (108) in a build chamber (102), the method comprising: receiving, by a processing device, image data corresponding to a plurality of images of the powder layer (112) supported by a powder bed (110) within the build chamber (102) from one or more imaging devices (114a, 114b) positioned to image the powder bed (110); determining, by the processing device, a leading region of interest (402) located adjacent to a leading end (220) of the moving powder distributor (108), the leading region of interest (402) moving according to movement of the moving powder distributor (108); determining, by the processing device, a trailing region of interest (406) located adjacent to a trailing end (240) of the moving powder distributor (108), the trailing region of interest (406) moving according to the moving powder distributor (108); selecting, by the processing device, at least one point (P) on the powder bed (110) that is located in the leading region of interest (402) from the image data; determining, by the processing device, one or more first characteristics of the at least one point (P); when the at least one point (P) is located within the trailing region of interest (406) due to movement of the moving powder distributor (108), determining, by the processing device, one or more second characteristics of the at least one point (P); and comparing, by the processing device, the one or more first characteristics of the at least one point (P) to the one or more second characteristics of the at least one point (P) to monitor the powder layer (112) distributed by the moving powder distributor (108).
2. The method of claim 1, wherein receiving the image data comprises at least one of: receiving a radiation map corresponding to an amount of radiation emitted from the powder layer (112); receiving a time stamp corresponding to a time at which the plurality of images of the powder layer (112) were captured relative to movement of the moving powder distributor (108); and receiving leading image data from a first imaging device (114a) and receiving trailing image data from a second imaging device (114b), the leading image data comprising the leading region of interest and the trailing image data comprising the trailing region of interest.
3. The method of claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising, prior to determining the leading region of interest, identifying, by the processing device, the moving powder distributor (108) from the image data.
4. The method of any one of the preceding claims, further comprising providing feedback to one or more components of the build chamber (102) based on the comparing.
5. The method of any one of the preceding claims, further comprising directing movement of the moving powder distributor (108) based on the comparing.
6. The method of any one of the preceding claims, further comprising determining one or more powder defects based on the comparing.
