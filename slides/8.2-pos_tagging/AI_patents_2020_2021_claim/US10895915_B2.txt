Systems, devices, and/or methods for reporting
</title>

<abstract>
Certain exemplary embodiments can cause a report to be rendered on a user interface. The report comprises writing of a user. The writing of the user is determined based upon a first signal. The first signal is transmitted responsive to motion of a finger of the user from a sensor coupled to a finger of the user. The sensor is communicatively coupled to a first wireless transceiver.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: causing a report to be rendered on a user interface, the report comprising writing of a user, the writing of the user determined based upon a first signal, the first signal transmitted responsive to motion of a finger of the user from a sensor coupled to the finger of the user, the sensor communicatively coupled to a first wireless transceiver, the first signal processed by an information device, the writing of the user also determined based upon a second signal, the second signal received from a body camera coupled to a body of the user, the second signal indicative of words of the user stating what was written by the motion of the finger of the user, the words of the user spoken responsive to a request from the information device transmitted to an earpiece worn by the user, the information device constructed to compare content of the first signal to content of the second signal and thereby determine the writing of the user.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein: the motion of the finger of the user is on a surface.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein: the motion of the finger of the user is not on a surface.
4. A method comprising: causing a report to be rendered on a user interface, the report comprising writing of a user, the writing of the user determined based upon a first signal, the first signal transmitted responsive to motion of a finger of the user from a sensor coupled to the finger of the user, the sensor communicatively coupled to a first wireless transceiver, the first signal processed by a first information device, the writing of the user also determined based upon a second signal, the second signal received from a second information device in proximity to the user, the second signal indicative of words of the user stating what was written by the motion of the finger of the user, the words of the user spoken responsive to a request from the first information device transmitted to an earpiece worn by the user, the first information device constructed to compare content of the first signal to content of the second signal and thereby determine the writing of the user.
5. A method comprising: causing a report to be rendered on a user interface, the report comprising writing of a user, the writing of the user determined based upon a first signal, the first signal transmitted responsive to motion of a finger of the user from a camera viewing the finger of the user, the camera communicatively coupled to a first wireless transceiver, the first signal processed by a first information device, the writing of the user also determined based upon a second signal, the second signal received from a second information device in proximity to the user, the second signal indicative of words of the user stating what was written by the motion of the finger of the user, the words of the user spoken responsive to a request from the first information device transmitted to an earpiece worn by the user, the first information device constructed to compare content of the first signal to content of the second signal and thereby determine the writing of the user.
