SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR EFFICIENT MEDIA EDITING
</title>

<abstract>
In the field of media editing, in one embodiment, a computer-implemented method may include steps for presenting a representation of a video at a user device; receiving a user selection of a selected portion of the video at a first time; generating a reversed video portion based on the selected portion; and combining at least a first portion of the video and a second portion of the reversed video portion to produce the media file. In some embodiments, the method further comprises receiving a user input at the user device, the user input indicative of playback of the selected portion of the video in a forward direction and in a reverse direction; updating the reversed video portion based on the user input to yield an updated reversed video portion; and generating instructions to combine the selected portion and the updated reversed video portion to produce the media file.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system for producing a media file, comprising: a non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium storing program code; and a processor that executes the program code to perform operations to: present a representation of a video at a user device; receive a user selection of a selected portion of the video at a first time; generate a reversed video portion based on the selected portion; and combine at least a first portion of the video and a second portion of the reversed video portion to produce the media file.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise to: receive a user input at the user device, the user input indicative of playback of the selected portion of the video in a forward direction and in a reverse direction; update the reversed video portion based on the user input to yield an updated reversed video portion; and combine the selected portion and the updated reversed video portion to produce the media file.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein updating the reversed video portion comprises scaling the reversed video portion based on a scaling factor based on the user input.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise to: execute one or more instructions to combine the video and the reversed video portion to produce the media file.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the instructions comprise additional instructions to combine a third portion of the video that occurs before the selected portion, the reversed video portion, and a fourth portion of the video including the selected portion and a remainder of the video.
6. The system of claim 5, wherein the instructions comprise additional instructions to compress the fourth portion.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise to: present a preview of the media file at the user device.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the video further comprises existing audio, and wherein the operations further comprise to process the video to filter the existing audio.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the operations further comprise to: receive an audio file at the user device, wherein the audio file is selected from a database of audio files; and generate a reversed audio portion of the audio file at the first time.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the operations further comprise to: combine the video, the reversed audio portion, and the reversed video portion.
11. The system of claim 1, wherein generating the reversed video portion at the first time based on the selected portion is performed in a background process while the user is performing editing operations on the user device.
12. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing computer-executable program code for producing a media file which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to perform operations to: present a representation of a video at a user device; receive a user selection of a selected portion of the video at a first time; generate a reversed video portion based on the selected portion; and combine at least a first portion of the video and a second portion of the reversed video portion to produce the media file.
13. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 12, wherein the operations further comprise to: receive a user input at the user device, the user input indicative of playback of the selected portion of the video in a forward direction and in a reverse direction; update the reversed video portion based on the user input to yield an updated reversed video portion; and generate instructions to combine the selected portion and the updated reversed video portion to produce the media file.
14. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 13, wherein the instructions comprise additional instructions to combine a third portion of the video that occurs before the selected portion, the reversed video portion, and a fourth portion of the video including the selected portion and a remainder of the video.
15. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 14, wherein the instructions comprise additional instructions to compress the fourth portion.
16. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 12, wherein the operations further comprise to present a preview of the media file at the user device.
17. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 12, wherein the video further comprises existing audio, and wherein the operations further comprise to process the video to filter the existing audio.
18. A computer-implemented method for producing a media file, comprising: presenting a representation of a video at a user device; receiving a user selection of a selected portion of the video at a first time; generating a reversed video portion based on the selected portion; and generating the media file by combining at least a first portion of the video and a second portion of the reversed video portion.
19. The computer-implemented method of claim 18, wherein generating the media file comprises combining a second portion of the video that occurs before the selected portion, the reversed video portion, and a third portion of the video including the selected portion and a remainder of the video.
20. The computer-implemented method of claim 18, further comprising: receiving an audio file at the user device; generating a reversed audio portion of the audio file at the first time; and generating the media file by combining the video, the reversed audio portion, and the reversed video portion.
