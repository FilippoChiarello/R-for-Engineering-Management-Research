A DEVICE AND METHOD FOR THERMAL IMAGING OF A LIVING MAMMAL BODY SECTION
</title>

<abstract>
A device of and a method for obtaining thermal images of a living mammal body section. The device comprises a thermal energy storage surface structure for contacting the body section. In a calibration mode of operation, the thermal energy storage surface structure is brought at a reference temperature by transferring thermal energy to the thermal energy storage surface structure from a thermal energy transfer module that is controlled by a control circuit for restraining thermal energy transfer by the thermal energy transfer module in the presence of the body section at the thermal energy storage surface structure. In a registration mode of operation, by a thermal sensor, thermal images reflecting thermal energy storage over at least a portion of the thermal energy storage surface structure are obtained, with the body section contacting the thermal energy storage surface structure. From a series of time consecutive thermal images obtained, a region of interest is determined, based on storage of thermal energy by the thermal energy storage surface structure.
