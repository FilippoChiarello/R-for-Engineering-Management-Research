<title>
System and Method for Automated Prediction and Detection of Component and System Failures
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method for automatically predicting and detecting a failure of a system or a component includes one or data sources, a data pipeline interface communicably coupled to the one or more data sources, one or more processors communicably coupled to the data pipeline interface and the one or more relational databases, and one or more devices coupled to the one or more processors. The data pipeline interface processes and stores the data in one or more relational databases. The one or more processors quantify, forecast and prognosticate a likelihood of future events using one or more predictive modules, and determine one or more options and impacts using a prescriptive module. The one or more devices provide the one or more options and impacts or implement the one or more options.
