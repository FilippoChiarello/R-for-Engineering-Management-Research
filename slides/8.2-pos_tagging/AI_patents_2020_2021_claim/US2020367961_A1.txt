ACNE TREATMENT SYSTEM AND METHODS
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for treating acne including an apparatus that applies or a method involving applying targeted energy to disrupt or destroy sebocyte progenitor cells within a target sebaceous gland. In one approach, specific sebocyte receptors are targeted to facilitate disrupting and/or destroying targeted sebocytes.

<claims>
1. 1.-52. (canceled)
53. An acne treatment system for treating target areas of skin including one or more hair follicles, comprising: a treatment component that is configured to apply energy to target areas; a sebaceous gland sensing component that identifies one or more of a location of sebaceous glands or progenitor cells thereof; and a controller that automatically directs the treatment component based upon the location of sebaceous glands or progenitor cells.
54. The acne treatment system of claim 53, wherein the sebaceous gland sensing component employs impedance to identify target tissue.
55. The acne treatment system of claim 53, further comprising one or more of one or a plurality of monopolar or bipolar needles to measure impedance.
56. The acne treatment system of claim 53, wherein the treatment component includes a needle configured to apply RF energy to target areas.
57. The acne treatment system of claim 53, wherein a characteristic of impedance of sebaceous gland is employed to distinguish sebaceous gland tissue from surrounding tissue.
58. The acne treatment system of claim 53, wherein the system employs machine learning or artificial intelligence to determine a predicted location or locations of progenitor cells in relationship to hair follicles,
59. The acne treatment system of claim 58, wherein the machine learning or artificial intelligence makes decisions regarding the number of cells to treat and an associated distribution to minimize side effects to therapy.
60. The acne treatment system of claim 53, wherein the system includes a predictive model based on histological evidence as to probability of locations of sebocyte progenitor cells relative to a pattern of hair follicles.
61. The acne treatment system of claim 53, wherein the controller controls the system utilizing memory and pattern recognition to avoid retreatment over areas previously treated.
62. The acne treatment system of claim 53, wherein the system delineates treated areas from untreated tissue.
63. The acne treatment system of claim 53, further comprising one or more of a laser configured to impart photoacoustic energy for ablation once a sebaceous gland is identified or an ultrasound transducer with fixed focus at a depth and configured to track and identify signals specific to sebaceous glands.
64. The acne treatment system of claim 53, wherein the system is configured to specifically target progenitor cells rather than the sebaceous gland in total.
65. The acne treatment system of claim 53, further comprising an isolated treatment region, wherein a consistent stream of cold or super cooled air is projected against skin during treatment.
66. The acne treatment system of claim 53, wherein the system employs mechanical disruption of the sebaceous gland and progenitor cells through air aspiration, pressurized air or water injection or through other mechanical means such as rapid rotational/cyclical movement of the needles with a specific pattern to preferentially target the gland and progenitor cells.
67. The acne treatment system of claim 53, wherein the system injects biologic material including drugs and sclerosing agents (such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate, ethanol, and hypertonic saline) to disrupt (including destroy) the sebaceous gland and sebocyte progenitor cells.
68. The acne treatment system of claim 53, wherein the sebaceous gland sensing component employs UV energy to identify and target tissue.
