<title>
Detecting user proximity in a physical area and managing physical interactions
</title>

<abstract>
A system manages physical interactions between users. The system analyzes wireless signals transmitted by a plurality of user devices within a physical area to identify one or more first users within proximity of a second user in the physical area. Actions of the second user are monitored to determine a level of concentration of the second user in performing a task. A probability of a physical interaction of the one or more first users with the second user causing loss of focus by the second user is determined, and physical interactions of the one or more first users with the second user are managed based on the determined probability to maintain focus of the second user on the task. Embodiments of the present invention further include a method and computer program product for managing physical interactions between users in substantially the same manner described above.
