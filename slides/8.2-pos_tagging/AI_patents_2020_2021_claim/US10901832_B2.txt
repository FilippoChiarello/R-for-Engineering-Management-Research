<title>
System for maintenance recommendation based on failure prediction
</title>

<abstract>
Example implementations described herein involve a system for maintenance recommendation based on data-driven failure prediction. The example implementations can involve estimating the probability of having a failure event in the near future given sensor measurements and events from the equipment, and then alerts the system user or maintenance staff if the probability of failure exceeds a certain threshold. The example implementations utilize historical failure cases along with the associated sensor measurements and events to learn a group of classification models that differentiate between failure and non-failure cases. In example implementations, the system then chooses the optimal model for failure prediction such that the overall cost of the maintenance process is minimized.
