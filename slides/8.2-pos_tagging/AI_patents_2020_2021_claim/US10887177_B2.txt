Calculating trust scores based on social graph statistics
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for calculating trust scores (trustworthiness) based on social graph statistics are described herein. The trust scores (trustworthiness) may be determined within or between individuals, groups, and/or entities represented by nodes in a social graph or other network. Social graph analytics may be used to determine connectivity statistics for each node in the social graph or network. The trust score may then be calculated by analyzing a number of paths connecting nodes in the network and the connectivity statistics associated with the nodes of the network. This trust score may then be used to make prospective real-world decisions, such as a request for credit or initiating a transaction.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: determining, by a system comprising a processor, network paths through a network comprising a first node and a second node, wherein a path of the network paths is between the first node and the second node; determining, by the system, path scores for the network paths, wherein the path scores comprise a path score for the path between the first node and the second node; determining, by the system, a network connectivity score between the first node and the second node based, at least in part, on a user connectivity value determined between the first node and the second node that is based, at least in part on, the path score for the path between the first node and the second node, wherein the determining the network connectivity score is based, at least in part, on the user connectivity value that is based, at least in part, on an average of the path score for the path between the first node and the second node and another path score of the path scores; and initiating, by the system, a transaction based, at least in part, on the network connectivity score between the first node and second node.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the determining the network connectivity score is based, at least in part, on the user connectivity value that is based, at least in part, on a sum of the path score and the other path score.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the other path score corresponds to another path between the first node and the second node.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the other path between the first node and the second node traverses a third node.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the other path score corresponds to another path between the first node and a third node different from the second node.
6. A system, comprising: a processor; and a memory that stores executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: determining a first path of network paths through a network comprising a first node and a second node, wherein the first path is between the first node and the second node; in response to determining path connectivity scores for the network paths, wherein the path connectivity scores comprise a first path connectivity score for the path between the first node and the second node, determining a network connectivity score between the first node and the second node, wherein the network connectivity score is based, at least in part, on the first path connectivity score, wherein the determining the network connectivity score is based, at least in part, on a weighted average of the first path connectivity score and at least a second path connectivity score of the path connectivity scores; and allowing a transaction to occur based, at least in part, on the network connectivity score between the first node and second node.
7. The system of claim 6, wherein the determining the network connectivity score is based, at least in part, on a sum of the first path connectivity score and the second path connectivity score.
8. The system of claim 6, wherein the second path connectivity score corresponds to a second path between the first node and the second node.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the second path between the first node and the second node comprises a third node.
10. The system of claim 6, wherein the second path connectivity score corresponds to a second path between the first node and a third node different from the second node.
11. A device, comprising: an interface for receiving a user request to perform a transaction via a network comprising a first node and a second node; and a processor coupled to a memory that stores executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: analyzing a first path of network paths through a network comprising a first node and a second node, wherein the first path is between the first node and the second node; calculating a network connectivity score, wherein the network connectivity score is based, at least in part, on a first path connectivity score, wherein the first path connectivity score is comprised in path connectivity scores for the network paths, and wherein the first path connectivity score corresponds to the first path, wherein the determining the network connectivity score is based, at least in part, on an average of the first path connectivity score and at least a second path connectivity score of the path connectivity scores; and permitting the transaction to occur based, at least in part, on the network connectivity score between the first node and second node.
12. The device of claim 11, wherein the determining the network connectivity score is based, at least in part, on a sum of the first path connectivity score and the second path connectivity score.
13. The device of claim 11, wherein the second path connectivity score corresponds to a second path between the first node and the second node.
14. The device of claim 11, wherein the second path connectivity score corresponds to a second path between the first node and a third node different from the second node.
