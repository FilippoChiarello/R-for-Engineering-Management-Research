SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING A VEHICLES AUTONOMOUS DRIVING MODE FROM A PLURALITY OF AUTONOMOUS MODES
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for implementing one or more autonomous features for autonomous and semi-autonomous control of one or more vehicles are provided. More specifically, image data may be obtained from an image acquisition device and processed utilizing one or more machine learning models to identify, track, and extract one or more features of the image utilized in decision making processes for providing steering angle and/or acceleration/deceleration input to one or more vehicle controllers. In some instances, techniques may be employed such that the autonomous and semi-autonomous control of a vehicle may change between vehicle follow and lane follow modes. In some instances, at least a portion of the machine learning model may be updated based on one or more conditions.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: receiving sensor data associated with a driving environment of a vehicle; determining an object within the driving environment; determining if the object is a second vehicle; if the object is a second vehicle, changing an autonomous driving mode to follow the second vehicle automatically; and if the object is not a second vehicle, changing the autonomous driving mode to follow a lane viewed in the driving environment.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the sensor data is an image of the driving environment.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein determining the object comprises automatically drawing a box over the object in the image.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein determining the object comprises executing a machine learning model that identifies the object in the box as a vehicle.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the box delineates the extents of the object within the image.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein a center of the box is determined.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein to follow the second vehicle, a position of the center of the box is maintained in subsequent images.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the second vehicle is in a caravan with the vehicle.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein determining if the object is a second vehicle comprises identifying the second vehicle as part of the caravan.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the second vehicle is identified by indicia on the vehicle.
11. A system comprising: a memory; a processor in communication with the memory, wherein the processor executes instructions stored in the memory, which cause the processor to execute a method, the method comprising: receiving sensor data associated with a driving environment of a vehicle; determining an object within the driving environment; determining if the object is a second vehicle; if the object is a second vehicle, changing an autonomous driving mode to follow the second vehicle automatically; and if the object is not a second vehicle, changing the autonomous driving mode to follow a lane viewed in the driving environment.
12. The system of claim 11, wherein the sensor data is an image of the driving environment.
13. The system of claim 11, wherein determining the object comprises automatically drawing a box over the object in an image, and wherein determining the object comprises executing a machine learning model that identifies the object in the box as a vehicle.
14. The system of claim 11, wherein a box delineates extents of the object within an image, wherein a center of the box is determined, and wherein to follow the second vehicle, a position of the center of the box is maintained in subsequent images.
15. The system of claim 11, wherein the second vehicle is in a caravan with the vehicle, wherein determine if the object is a second vehicle comprises identifying the second vehicle as part of the caravan, and wherein the second vehicle is identified by indicia on the vehicle.
16. A non-transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon instructions, which when executed by a processor cause the processor to execute a method, the method comprising: receiving sensor data associated with a driving environment of a vehicle; determining an object within the driving environment; determining if the object is a second vehicle; if the object is a second vehicle, changing an autonomous driving mode to follow the second vehicle automatically; and if the object is not a second vehicle, changing the autonomous driving mode to follow a lane viewed in the driving environment.
17. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, wherein the sensor data is an image of the driving environment.
18. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, wherein determining the object comprises automatically drawing a box over the object in an image, and wherein determining the object comprises executing a machine learning model that identifies the object in the box as a vehicle.
19. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, wherein a box delineates extents of the object within an image, wherein a center of the box is determined, and wherein to follow the second vehicle, a position of the center of the box is maintained in subsequent images.
20. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, wherein the second vehicle is in a caravan with the vehicle, wherein determine if the object is a second vehicle comprises identifying the second vehicle as part of the caravan, and wherein the second vehicle is identified by indicia on the vehicle.
