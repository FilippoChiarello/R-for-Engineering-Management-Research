<title>
Method for monitoring behaviour of a patient in real-time using patient monitoring device
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to a method for monitoring behaviour of a patient in real-time. The method comprises receiving, by a patient monitoring device, data related to the patient from one or more sources. Thereafter, the patient monitoring device classifies the received data into one or more categories based on one or more rules. Further, the patient monitoring device correlates the categorized data to identify one or more activity patterns corresponding to the patient, wherein each of the one or more activity patterns are associated with an activity performed by the patient at predefined time intervals. The patient monitoring devices compares the activity pattern with predefined activity patterns and detects abnormal behaviour of the patient if the identified activity pattern is different from one or more predefined activity patterns corresponding to the patient.

1. A method for monitoring behaviour of a patient in real-time, the method comprising: receiving, by a patient monitoring device comprising a processor and a memory, data related to an activity performed by the patient from one or more sources; classifying, by the patient monitoring device, the received data into one or more categories based on one or more rules, wherein the one or more rules categorize the received data into the one or more categories that comprise an audio category, a video category, an image category, and a medical category, and wherein the one or more rules further define different formats in which the one or more categories of the received data are to be processed by the patient monitoring device; filtering, by the patient monitoring device, the classified data based on one or more rules to identify one or more relevant data required for monitoring the behaviour of the patient in real-time, wherein the filtering of the data comprises processing the classified data based on the one or more rules to discard data indicative of an expected activity, and wherein the one or more rules are dynamically updated based on the activity performed by the patient and a time consumed to perform the activity; converting, by the patient monitoring device, the one or more relevant data from the different formats into a text format based on predefined configuration information stored in the memory; correlating, by the patient monitoring device, the one or more relevant data in the text format to identify one or more activity patterns corresponding to the patient, by performing text analytics technique in combination with one or more machine learning algorithms, wherein each of the one or more activity patterns are associated with the activity performed by the patient at predefined time intervals; detecting, by the patient monitoring device, abnormal behaviour that affect recovery of the patient if the one or more identified activity patterns are different from one or more predefined activity patterns corresponding to the patient; identifying, by the patient monitoring device, one or more remedies for the detected abnormal behaviour of the patient; and generating, by the patient monitoring device, an alert notification of the detected abnormal behavior, wherein the alert notification along with the one or more remedies are provided to one or more receiving entities for taking an immediate remedy action on the patient.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising: comparing, by the patient monitoring device, the abnormal behaviour of the patient with a symptom learning table, to identify one or more symptoms corresponding to the abnormal behaviour of the patient, wherein each of the one or more symptoms is associated with a precaution measure; and indicating, by the patient monitoring device, the precaution measure corresponding to the identified symptom to one or more receiving entities.
3. The method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the symptom learning table is extracted from one or more medical repositories associated with the patient monitoring system.
4. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the received data is at least one of audio data, video data, image data, medical data and patient data.
5. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the one or more sources are at least one of audio recording device, video capturing device, image capturing device and one or more medical devices.
6. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the activity comprises a voluntary activity performed by the patient.
7. A patient monitoring device for monitoring behaviour of a patient in real-time, the patient monitoring device comprising: a processor; and a memory communicatively coupled to the processor, wherein the memory stores the processor-executable instructions, which, on execution, causes the processor to: receive data related to an activity performed by the patient from one or more sources; classify the received data into one or more categories based on one or more rules, wherein the one or more rules categorize the received data into the one or more categories that comprise an audio category, a video category, an image category, and a medical category, and wherein the one or more rules further define different formats in which the one or more categories of the received data are to be processed by the patient monitoring device; filter the classified data based on one or more rules to identify one or more relevant data required for monitoring the behaviour of the patient in real-time, wherein the filtering of the data comprises processing the classified data based on the one or more rules to discard data indicative of an expected activity, and wherein the one or more rules are dynamically updated based on the activity performed by the patient and a time consumed to perform the activity; convert the one or more relevant data from the different formats into a text format based on predefined configuration information stored in the memory; correlate the one or more relevant data in the text format to identify one or more activity patterns corresponding to the patient, by performing text analytics technique in combination with one or more machine learning algorithms, wherein each of the one or more activity patterns are associated with the activity performed by the patient at predefined time intervals; detect abnormal behaviour that affect recovery of the patient if the one or more identified activity patterns are different from one or more predefined activity patterns corresponding to the patient; identify one or more remedies for the detected abnormal behaviour of the patient; and generate an alert notification of the detected abnormal behavior, wherein the alert notification along with the one or more remedies are provided to one or more receiving entities for taking an immediate remedy action on the patient.
8. The patient monitoring device as claimed in claim 7, wherein the processor is further configured to: compare the abnormal behaviour of the patient with a symptom learning table, to identify one or more symptoms corresponding to the abnormal behaviour of the patient, wherein each of the one or more symptoms is associated with a precaution measure; and indicate the precaution measure corresponding to the identified symptom to one or more receiving entities.
9. The patient monitoring device as claimed in claim 8, wherein the processor is configured to extract symptom learning table from one or more medical repositories associated with the patient monitoring system.
