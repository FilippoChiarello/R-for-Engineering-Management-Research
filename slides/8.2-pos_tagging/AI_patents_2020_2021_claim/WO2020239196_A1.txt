SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR TRAINING A GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL MODEL GENERATING IMAGE SAMPLES OF DIFFERENT BRIGHTNESS LEVELS
</title>

<abstract>
The invention relates to a method and system for training a generative adversarial model generating image samples of different brightness levels. The method comprises the steps of: a - obtaining (SOI) a set of training image data comprising for each of a plurality of training images an input image sample and a target image sample representing the same image but in a different brightness level, b - providing (S02) an image generating model having an encoder configured to receive the input image sample and a plurality of decoder branches configured to output each a generated output sample, c - providing (S03) a discriminator model, d - training (S04) the image generating model using the set of training image data based on a predefined loss function, wherein for each training image among the decoder branches only the decoder branch whose generated output sample has a minimum loss compared to all other decoder branches is optimized based on said predefined loss function, and wherein the training step (S04) of d is augmented by an adversarial loss which is based on the output of the discriminator model.
