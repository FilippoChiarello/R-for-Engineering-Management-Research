<title>
ASSEMBLY ERROR CORRECTION FOR ASSEMBLY LINES
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the disclosed technology provide a computational model that utilizes machine learning for detecting errors during a manual assembly process and determining a sequence of steps to complete the manual assembly process in order to mitigate the detected errors. In some implementations, the disclosed technology evaluates a target object at a step of an assembly process where an error is detected to a nominal object to obtain a comparison. Based on this comparison, a sequence of steps for completion of the assembly process of the target object is obtained. The assembly instructions for creating the target object are adjusted based on this sequence of steps.
