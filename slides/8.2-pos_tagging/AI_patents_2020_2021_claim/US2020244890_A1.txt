UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
The present invention relates to unmanned aerial vehicle for agricultural field assessment. It is described to fly (210) the unmanned aerial vehicle to a location in a field containing a crop. A body of the unmanned aerial vehicle is positioned (220) in a substantially stationary aspect above the crop at the location. A camera of the unmanned aerial vehicle is moved (230) vertically with respect to the body of the unmanned aerial vehicle between a first position and a second position, wherein the first position is closer to the body of the unmanned aerial vehicle than the second position. The camera acquires (240) at least one image relating to the crop when the camera is not in the first position.

<claims>
1. An unmanned aerial vehicle (10) for agricultural field assessment, comprising: a control unit (20); and a camera (30); wherein, the camera is configured to be moved vertically with respect to a body (40) of the unmanned aerial vehicle between a first position and a second position, wherein the first position is closer to the body of the unmanned aerial vehicle than the second position; wherein, the control unit is configured to fly the unmanned aerial vehicle to a location in a field containing a crop; wherein, the control unit is configured to position the body of the unmanned aerial vehicle in a substantially stationary aspect above the crop at the location; wherein, when the body of the unmanned aerial vehicle is in the substantially stationary aspect above the crop at the location, the control unit is configured to move the camera vertically; and wherein, when the body of the unmanned aerial vehicle is in the substantially stationary aspect above the crop at the location, the control unit is configured to control the camera to acquire at least one image relating to the crop when the camera is not in the first position. wherein the control unit is configured to determine a reference height from the ground by acquiring imagery from the ground for further determining the height of all mages above the ground.
2. Unmanned aerial vehicle according to claim 1, wherein the at least one image relating to the crop comprises at least one image acquired when the camera is within a canopy of the crop.
3. Unmanned aerial vehicle according to claim 1, wherein the at least one image comprises a plurality of images and wherein the control unit is configured to control the camera to acquire the plurality of images at a corresponding plurality of different positions that are not the first position.
4. Unmanned aerial vehicle according to claim 1, wherein the control unit is configured to control the camera to acquire at least one image of the at least one image relating to the crop when the camera is in the second position.
5. Unmanned aerial vehicle according to claim 3, wherein the second position comprises the ground.
6. Unmanned aerial vehicle according to claim 1, wherein the control unit is configured to control the camera to acquire at least one image relating to the crop when the camera is in the first position.
7. Unmanned aerial vehicle according to claim 1, wherein a processing unit (50) is configured to analyse the at least one image to determine a leaf area index for the crop.
8. Unmanned aerial vehicle according to claim 1, wherein a processing unit (60) is configured to analyse the at least one image to determine at least one weed, and/or determine at least one disease, and/or determine at least one pest, and/or determine at least one insect, and/or determine at least one nutritional deficiency.
9. Unmanned aerial vehicle according to claim 7, wherein the unmanned aerial vehicle comprises the processing unit (50) and/or the processing unit (60).
10. Unmanned aerial vehicle according to claim 1, wherein the unmanned aerial vehicle comprises at least one leg (70), and wherein the control unit is configured to land the unmanned aerial vehicle on the at least one leg at the location to position the body of the unmanned aerial vehicle in a substantially stationary aspect above the crop at the location.
11. Unmanned aerial vehicle according to claim 1, wherein the unmanned aerial vehicle is configured to operate in a hover mode, and wherein the control unit is configured to hover the unmanned aerial vehicle at the location to position the body of the unmanned aerial vehicle in a substantially stationary aspect above the crop at the location.
12. Unmanned aerial vehicle according to claim 7, wherein the camera when in the first position is configured to acquire at least one image relating to the field and/or a second camera (80) of the unmanned aerial vehicle is configured to acquire the at least one image relating to the field, and the processing unit is configured to analyse the at least one image relating to the field to determine the location in the field.
13. Unmanned aerial vehicle according to claim 1, wherein the unmanned aerial vehicle comprises location determining means (90).
14. A method (200) for agricultural field assessment, comprising: a) flying (210) an unmanned aerial vehicle to a location in a field containing a crop; b) positioning (220) a body of the unmanned aerial vehicle in a substantially stationary aspect above the crop at the location; c) moving (230) a camera of the unmanned aerial vehicle vertically with respect to the body of the unmanned aerial vehicle between a first position and a second position, wherein the first position is closer to the body of the unmanned aerial vehicle than the second position; and d) acquiring (240) by the camera at least one image relating to the crop when the camera is not in the first position. e) determining a reference height from the ground by acquiring imagery from the ground for further determining the height of all mages above the ground.
15. A computer program element for controlling an unmanned aerial vehicle, which when executed by a processor is configured to carry out the method of claim 14.
