LOW ENERGY IMMUNE PRIMING FOR TREATING CANCER AND METASTASIS
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed herein are the systems, devices and methods for treating cancer and metastasis using low energy immune priming. The low energy immune priming includes administering immunopriming energy. The low energy immune priming can be combined with an adjunct therapy.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. An acoustic priming therapy system comprising: a processor; one or more ultrasound transducers coupled to the processor, the ultrasound transducers configured to produce one or more ultrasound beams such that the frequency waveform of the one or more ultrasound beams has a spatial peak temporal average acoustic output intensity (Ispta) of between 10 and 900 W/cm2 and a âˆ’3 dB beam volume of at least 0.5 cm3; and a probe coupled to the processor the probe configured to monitor the patient, wherein the processor and the ultrasound transducer are configured to scan tissue volumetrically at a rate of at least about 0.5 cm3 per second.
2. (canceled)
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor and the ultrasound transducer are configured to scan tissue volumetrically within a range of at least about 0.5 cm3 per second.
4. 4.-8. (canceled)
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the average acoustic output intensity is within a range from about 20 W/cm2 to about 500 W/cm2.
10. (canceled)
11. (canceled)
12. The system of claim 1, further comprising a linkage coupled to the one or more ultrasound transducers, the processor coupled to the linkage and configured with instructions to move the one or more ultrasound transducers to a plurality of locations.
13. The system of claim 12, wherein the linkage comprises a robotic arm comprising a plurality of joints, each of the plurality of joints coupled to an actuator to control an angle of the joint and wherein the processor is configured with instructions to determine a plurality of angles of the plurality of joints to direct the ultrasound beam to the plurality of locations.
14. (canceled)
15. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is configured to control an orientation of the ultrasound transducer at each of the plurality of locations in order to align the ultrasound transducer with a surface of a skin of the patient at each of the plurality of locations.
16. (canceled)
17. The system of claim 1, further comprising a user input for a user to specify an adjunct therapy to be combined with the ultrasound treatment, and wherein the processor is configured with instructions to record a time of treatment of the ultrasound beam to the tissue and output a time for the adjunct therapy and optionally wherein the adjunct therapy is selected from the group consisting of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, Irreversible Electroporation (IRE), Microwave therapy, Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LOFU), and High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU), and optionally wherein the output time comprises a time window for the adjunct therapy.
18. The system of claim 1, wherein the processor is configured with instructions to provide a user interface to a user, the user interface comprising an image of a tumor of the patient and input treatment locations.
19. (canceled)
20. (canceled)
21. The system of claim 1, wherein the probe is an imaging probe or a thermometer.
22. (canceled)
23. The system of claim 22, wherein the thermometer is a thermocouple or a fiber optic temperature probe.
24. 24.-26. (canceled)
27. The system of claim 1, wherein the probe comprises a separate transducer that measures ultrasound.
28. (canceled)
29. The system of claim 1, further comprising a cooling system.
30. The system of claim 17, wherein the adjunct therapy is radiotherapy.
31. (canceled)
32. The system of claim 17, wherein the adjunct therapy is IRE.
33. (canceled)
34. The system of claim 17, wherein the adjunct therapy is microwave therapy.
35. (canceled)
36. The system of claim 17, wherein the adjunct therapy is LOFU.
37. 37.-39. (canceled)
40. The system of claim 17, wherein the adjunct therapy is HIFU.
41. 41.-43. (canceled)
44. The system of claim 17, wherein the adjunct therapy is chemotherapy.
45. 45.-49. (canceled)
50. The system of claim 17, wherein the adjunct therapy is immunotherapy.
51. 51.-54. (canceled)
55. A method of treating a patient, the method comprising: administering an immunopriming energy selected from the group consisting of Irreversible Electroporation (IRE), Microwave, Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LOFU), High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU), Radiofrequency energy and cryotherapy; and administering an immunotherapy selected from the group consisting of dendritic cell targeted therapy, effector T cell targeting, immune checkpoint inhibition.
56. 56.-58. (canceled)
