INFORMATION PROCESSING DEVICE AND INFORMATION PROCESSING METHOD

<abstract>
Notification of driving return to a driver is performed at an appropriate timing.A notification controlling unit controls notification for prompting a driver to return to driving. For example, the notification is performed by a sound output, a light output, display of a character or a mark, haptics, or the like. A calculation unit calculates a return delay time period for determining a notification timing on the basis of a state of the driver. For example, the calculation unit calculates a return delay time period in response to an observable evaluation value based on a type of secondary task being executed by the driver and biological activity observable information of the driver. A return delay time period for determining a notification timing is calculated in response to a type of secondary task and biological activity observable information of the driver, so that a more accurate return delay time period can be obtained and notification of driving return to the driver can be performed at an appropriate timing.
