METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RELEASING A MOBILITY CONFIGURATION WITHOUT A SIGNAL FROM A NETWORK IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
</title>

<abstract>
A method and apparatus for releasing a mobility configuration without a signal from a network in a wireless communication system is provided. A wireless device receives, from a serving cell, a mobility configuration related to a target cell, wherein the mobility configuration includes a specific identity. A wireless device detects that measurement result of the target cell satisfies a leaving condition related to the specific identity. A wireless device releases, autonomously, the mobility configuration related to the target cell based on the detection.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method performed by a wireless device in a wireless communication, the method comprising: receiving, from a serving cell, a mobility configuration related to a target cell, wherein the mobility configuration includes a specific identity; detecting that measurement result of the target cell satisfies a leaving condition related to the specific identity; and releasing, autonomously, the mobility configuration related to the target cell based on the detection.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises, transmitting, to the serving cell, a measurement report related to the target cell based on the detection, wherein the measurement report includes an information related to the specific identity..
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the measurement report includes an information informing that the mobility configuration is released autonomously.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises, transmitting, to the serving cell, a measurement report including an information related to the target cell, before receiving the mobility configuration, wherein the wireless device receives the mobility configuration related to the target cell in response to the measurement report.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the leaving condition is configured by the serving cell.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the mobility configuration is network configuration related to mobility of the wireless device.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the mobility configuration includes a conditional handover commend.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the specific identity is a measurement identity which is configured for the wireless device for measurement and related to the target cell and the leaving condition.
9. The method of claim 1, wherein the specific identity is a report configuration identity which is configured for the wireless device for measurement and informs a report configuration including the leaving condition.
10. The method of claim 1, wherein the mobility configuration is related to multiple target cells and the specific identity is configured separately for each of the mobility target cells.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the method further comprises, starting a timer based on the detection.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the mobility configuration is released when the timer is expired.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the timer is configured by the serving cell.
14. The method of claim 1, wherein the wireless device is an autonomous driving apparatus in communication with at least one of a mobile terminal, a network, and/or autonomous vehicles other than the wireless device.
15. A wireless device in a wireless communication system, the wireless device comprising: a memory; a transceiver; and a processor, operably coupled to the memory and the transceiver, and configured to: control the transceiver to receive, from a serving cell, a mobility configuration related to a target cell, wherein the mobility configuration includes a specific identity; detect measurement result of the target cell satisfies a leaving condition related to the specific identity; and release, autonomously, the mobility configuration related to the target cell based on the detection.
