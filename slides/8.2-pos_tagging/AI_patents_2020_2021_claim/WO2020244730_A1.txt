NETWORK NODE AND METHODS IN A COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK
</title>

<abstract>
A method performed by a network node for handling one or more upcoming requests for one or more services from a communication device in a communications network using a cloud infrastructure is provided. The network node obtains (301) a prediction of an amount of instances needed for the one or more upcoming requests for the one or more services, based on historical data of previous requests for services, and obtains (304) network connections needed for the one or more upcoming requests for the one or more services, taking the prediction into account. Furthermore, the network node decides (307) to instantiate a service with the obtained network connections and/or the amount of instances as predicted.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method performed by a network node (110) for handling one or more upcoming requests for one or more services from a communication device (121 , 122) in a communications network (100) using a cloud infrastructure (101 ), the method comprising:
obtaining (301 ) a prediction of an amount of instances needed for the one or more upcoming requests for the one or more services, based on historical data of previous requests for services;
obtaining (304) network connections needed for the one or more upcoming requests for the one or more services, taking the prediction into account; and deciding (307) to instantiate a service with the obtained network connections and/or the amount of instances as predicted.
2. The method according to claim 1 , further comprising:
receiving (308) from the communication device (121 , 122), a request for the one or more services, and
providing (309) a response to the request from the communication device (121 , 122) using the instantiated service.
3. The method according to any of the claims 1 -2, wherein the obtaining (301 ) the prediction of network connections needed for the one or more upcoming requests for the one or more services further comprises any one or more out of:
performing (302) the prediction, and/or
retrieving (303) the prediction.
4. The method according to any of the claims 1-3, wherein the obtaining (304) of the network connections needed for the upcoming requests for services, taking the prediction into account, further comprises any one or more out of:
determining (305) the network connections needed for the one or more upcoming requests for the one or more services, and/or
retrieving (306) information related to the network connections needed for the one or more upcoming requests for the one or more services. 5. The method according to claim 2, or claims 3-4 when dependent on claim 2, wherein the obtaining (301 ) the prediction of the amount of instances needed for the upcoming requests for services, the obtaining (304) of the network connections needed for the upcoming requests for services, and the deciding (305) to instantiate a service with the obtained network connections and/or the amount of instances as predicted, are performed in an offline process, and wherein the receiving (306) of the request for a service and the providing (307) the response to the request from the communication device (121 , 122) using the instantiated service, are performed in an online process.
6. The method according to any of the claims 1-5, wherein the amount of instances comprises an amount of instances of a service function.
7. The method according to any of the claims 1 -6, wherein the prediction of the
amount of instances needed for the one or more upcoming requests for the one or more services, is performed by a machine learning process.
8. The method according to claim 7, wherein the machine learning process is a
reinforcement-based machine learning process.
9. The method according to any of claims 1-8, wherein the prediction of the amount of instances needed for the one or more upcoming requests for the one or more services, obtained (301 ) by the network node (110), further comprises a prediction of:
when a certain service function will be needed, and/or
how many resources need to be allocated for the service.
10. A computer program (590) comprising instructions, which when executed by a processor (515), causes the processor (515) to perform actions according to any of the claims 1-9.
1 1. A carrier (595) comprising the computer program (590) of claim 10, wherein the carrier (595) is one of an electronic signal, an optical signal, an electromagnetic signal, a magnetic signal, an electric signal, a radio signal, a microwave signal, or a computer-readable storage medium. 12. A network node (1 10) configured to handle one or more upcoming requests for one or more services from a communication device (121 , 122) in a communications network (100) using a cloud infrastructure (101 ), the network node (1 10) being further configured to:
obtain a prediction of an amount of instances needed for the one or more upcoming requests for the one or more services, based on historical data of previous requests for services;
obtain network connections needed for the one or more upcoming requests for the one or more services, taking the prediction into account; and
decide to instantiate a service with the obtained network connections and/or the amount of instances as predicted.
13. The network node (1 10) according to claim 12, further being configured to:
receive from the communication device (121 , 122), a request for the one or more services, and
provide a response to the request from the communication device (121 , 122) using the instantiated service.
14. The network node (1 10) according to any of the claims 12-13, wherein the network node (1 10) is further configured to obtain the prediction of network connections by being configured to:
perform the prediction, and/or
retrieve the prediction.
15. The network node (1 10) according to any of the claims 12-14, wherein the network node (1 10) is further configured to obtain the network connections needed for the upcoming requests for services, taking the prediction into account, by being configured to:
determine the network connections needed for the one or more upcoming requests for the one or more services, and/or
retrieve information related to the network connections needed for the one or more upcoming requests for the one or more services.
16. The network node (1 10) according to claim 13, or claims 14-15 when dependent on claim 13, wherein the network node (1 10) is further configured to obtain the prediction of the amount of instances needed for the upcoming requests for services, obtain the network connections needed for the upcoming requests for services, and decide to instantiate a service with the obtained network connections and/or the amount of instances as predicted, in an offline process, and wherein the network node (1 10) is further configured to receive the request for a service and provide the response to the request from the communication device (121 ,
