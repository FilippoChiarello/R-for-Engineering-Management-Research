DISTRIBUTED MANAGEMENT OF USER PRIVACY INFORMATION
</title>

<abstract>
Methods and systems for managing user privacy information in a distributed fashion are provided. In one embodiment, a method is provided that may include receiving an identity with device information that is less sensitive and user information that is more sensitive. The user information may then be encrypted and stored on a repository, and indications of the encrypted device information and the encrypted user information may be stored on a distributed ledger. The method may further include enforcing a first access policy on the encrypted device information and a second access policy on encrypted user information.

<claims>
1. 1-15. (canceled)
16. A method comprising: receiving an identity that comprises device information regarding a user device and user information regarding a user of the user device; encrypting the device information to create encrypted device information; encrypting the user information to create encrypted user information; storing the encrypted device information and the encrypted user information in a repository; storing indications of the encrypted device information and the encrypted user information on a distributed ledger; and enforcing a first access policy on the encrypted device information and a second access policy on the encrypted user information.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein storing indications of the encrypted device information and the encrypted user information on the distributed ledger comprises storing the first and second encryption keys on the distributed ledger.
18. The method of claim 16, wherein storing the encrypted device information and the encrypted user information in the repository comprises storing the encrypted device information and the encrypted user information in separate containers of the repository.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the separate containers of the repository are separate segmented memories of the repository.
20. The method of claim 16, wherein the identity further includes a unique identifier and both the encrypted device information and the encrypted user information are stored in association with the unique identifier.
21. The method of claim 20, wherein the unique identifier is encrypted with the device information and the user information to form the encrypted device information and the encrypted user information.
22. The method of claim 20, wherein the encrypted device information and the encrypted user information are stored with associations to the unique identifier.
23. The method of claim 20, wherein the unique identifier is hashed before storing to generate a hashed unique identifier that is stored in association with the encrypted device information and the encrypted user information.
24. The method of claim 16, further comprising: storing the first and second encryption keys via a privacy manager configured to enforce the first and second access policies.
25. The method of claim 16, wherein the first access policy includes a first time stamp and the second access policy includes a second time stamp that is earlier than the first time stamp.
26. The method of claim 25, wherein the privacy manager is configured to delete the encrypted device information after the first time stamp and to delete the encrypted user information after the second time stamp.
27. The method of claim 16, further comprising: receiving, at the privacy manager, a request to access the user information from a requesting party; determining that the requesting party is authorized under the second access policy; and allowing the requesting party to access the data.
28. The method of claim 27, wherein allowing the requesting party to access the data comprises providing the requesting party with the encryption key.
29. The method of claim 27, wherein allowing the requesting party to access the data comprises: decrypting the encrypted user information with the second encryption key; and providing the user information to the requesting party.
30. The method of claim 27, wherein providing the user information to the requesting party comprises providing indirect access to the user information.
31. The method of claim 16, further comprising: receiving a request from the user to revoke access for a removed party to one or both of the user information and the device information; and removing the removed party from the associated access policy.
32. The method of claim 16, further comprising: receiving a request from the user to remove all access to one or both of the device information and the user information; and removing the associated encryption key.
33. The method of claim 16, wherein the first access policy includes no user-based access restrictions and wherein the second access policy allows only authorized accessors to access the user information.
34. A system comprising: a processor; and a memory storing instruction which, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to: receive an identity that comprises device information regarding a user device and user information regarding a user of the user device; separate the device information and the user information; encrypt the device information with a first encryption key to create encrypted device information; encrypt the user information with a second encryption key to create encrypted user information; store indications of the encrypted device information and the encrypted user information on the distributed ledger; and enforce a first access policy on the device information and a second access policy on the user information.
35. A non-transitory, computer-readable medium storing instructions which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: receive an identity that comprises device information regarding a user device and user information regarding a user of the user device; separate the device information and the user information; encrypt the device information with a first encryption key to create encrypted device information; encrypt the user information with a second encryption key to create encrypted user information; store indications of the encrypted device information and the encrypted user information on the distributed ledger; and enforce a first access policy on the device information and a second access policy on the user information.
