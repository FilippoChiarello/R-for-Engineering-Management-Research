INTERACTIVE PRODUCT DISPLAY SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING TARGETED ADVERTISEMENTS
</title>

<abstract>
A method for generating data indicative of a customer interaction with a product on display includes acquiring, by one or more sensors attached to a product on display in a product display area, sensor data; wirelessly transmitting the sensor data to at least one wireless receiver located in the vicinity of the product display area; and transmitting the sensor data from the at least one wireless receiver to a computer. The method further includes executing, by the computer, a machine learning algorithm in order to determine that a potential customer has interacted with the product on display and to generate insights about an interaction between the customer and the product on display.

<claims>
1. A method for generating data indicative of a customer interaction with a product on display, the method comprising: acquiring, by one or more sensors attached to a product on display in a product display area, sensor data; wirelessly transmitting the sensor data to at least one wireless receiver located in the vicinity of the product display area; transmitting the sensor data from the at least one wireless receiver to a computer; and executing, by the computer, a machine learning algorithm in order to determine that a potential customer has interacted with the product on display and to generate insights about an interaction between the customer and the product on display.
2. The method according to claim 1, further comprising executing, by the computer, a localization algorithm in order to determine a position of the product on display.
3. The method according to claim 2, wherein executing the localization algorithm includes analyzing, the computer, strengths of a signal by which the sensor data was wirelessly transmitted as measured by each of a plurality of wireless receivers and triangulating the position of the product on display based on the measured strengths of the signal.
4. The method according to claim 1, wherein the one or more sensors include light sensors, magnetic sensors, accelerometers, and/or gyroscopes.
5. The method according to claim 1, wherein the one or more sensors are coupled to an integrated circuit (IC) attached to the product on display.
6. The method according to claim 5, wherein the IC includes a system on a chip (SoC) capable of broadcasting advertising packets according to a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) specification.
7. The method according to claim 6, wherein the wirelessly transmitting the sensor data to a plurality of wireless receivers located in the vicinity of the product display area comprises broadcasting, by the SoC, advertising packets according to the BLE specification.
8. The method according to claim 7, wherein the plurality of wireless receivers located in the vicinity of the product display area are BLE receivers.
9. The method according to claim 1, wherein the insights about the interaction between the customer and the product on display includes an interaction time and/or a speed at which the product on display was moved.
10. The method according to claim 2, further comprising providing a targeted advertisement to the potential customer, wherein providing the targeted advertisement includes identifying, from a plurality of output devices, an output device that is located closest to the position of the product on display and providing the targeted advertisement at the output device that is located closes to the position of the product on display.
11. The method according to claim 1, further comprising generating, based on the insights, a targeted advertisement to the potential customer; and providing the targeted advertisement to the potential customer, wherein the targeted advertisement includes audio, video, and/or still images.
12. A system for generating data indicative of a customer interaction with product on display and for providing targeted advertisement, the system comprising: an integrated circuit (IC) attached to a product on display in a product display area, the IC being coupled to one or more sensors, the IC being configured to wirelessly transmit sensor data acquired by the one or more sensors to one or more wireless receivers located in the vicinity of the product display area; the one or more wireless receivers, the one or more wireless receivers being configured to receive the sensor data from the IC and to transmit the received sensor data to a processor; the processor, configured to execute a machine learning algorithm in order to determine that a potential customer has interacted with the product on display to generate insights about an interaction between the customer and the product on display, and to generate, based on the insights, a targeted advertisement to the potential customer; and an output device configured to provide the targeted advertisement to the potential customer.
13. The system according to claim 12, wherein the computer is further configured to execute a localization algorithm in order to determine a position of the product on display.
14. The system according to claim 12, wherein the one or more sensors include light sensors, magnetic sensors, accelerometers, and/or gyroscopes.
15. The system according to claim 12, wherein the output device includes a display screen and/or a speaker.
