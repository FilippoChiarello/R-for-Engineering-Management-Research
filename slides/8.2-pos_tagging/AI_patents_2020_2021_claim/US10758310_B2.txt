<title>
Wireless pairing of a surgical device with another device within a sterile surgical field based on the usage and situational awareness of devices
</title>

<abstract>
A surgical system includes a first surgical device comprising a control circuit. The control circuit is configured to be situationally aware of events occurring within the vicinity of the first surgical device according to data received from a database, a patient monitoring device, or a paired surgical device, or any combination of a database, patient monitoring device, or paired surgical device. The control circuit is configured to be wirelessly paired with a second surgical device according to usage of the first surgical device and the events of which the first surgical device is situationally aware.

<claims>
1. A surgical system comprising: a first surgical device comprising a control circuit, the control circuit configured to: be situationally aware of events occurring within a vicinity of the first surgical device according to data received from a database, a patient monitoring device, or a paired surgical device, or any combination of the database, the patient monitoring device, or the paired surgical device; and wirelessly pair with a second surgical device according to a usage of the first surgical device and the events of which the first surgical device is situationally aware, wherein the control circuit is further configured to simultaneously activate the first surgical device and the second surgical device each for a predetermined period of time when no tissue or patient is sensed.
2. The surgical system of claim 1, wherein the events of which the first surgical device is situationally aware comprise a first user using the first surgical device and a second user using the second surgical device.
3. The surgical system of claim 2, wherein the events comprising the first user using the first surgical device comprise the first user grasping a handle of the first surgical device.
4. The surgical system of claim 3, wherein the events comprising the first user grasping a handle of the first surgical device comprise the first user grasping the handle of the first surgical device thereby allowing a transceiver in the handle of the first surgical device to communicate with an identifier worn by the first user and allowing, by the identifier, a communication between the first surgical device and a surgical hub.
5. The surgical system of claim 2, wherein the events of which the first surgical device is situationally aware comprise a location of the first surgical device and a location of the second surgical device.
6. The surgical system of claim 5, wherein the control circuit is configured to determine the location of the second surgical device based on a wireless signal transmitted by the second surgical device to the first surgical device.
7. The surgical system of claim 1, wherein the first surgical device is located within a sterile field and the second surgical device is located outside the sterile field when the first surgical device wirelessly pairs with the second surgical device.
8. The surgical system of claim 1, wherein the control circuit is further configured to wireless pair with a communication device.
9. The surgical system of claim 1, wherein the events of which the first surgical device is situationally aware comprise a determination of a distance between the first surgical device and a tissue structure within a patient.
10. A method comprising: being situationally aware, by a control circuit within a first surgical device, of events occurring within a vicinity of the first surgical device according to data received from a database, a patient monitoring device, or a paired surgical device, or any combination of the database, the patient monitoring device, or the paired surgical device; wirelessly pairing, by the control circuit, with a second surgical device according to a usage of the first surgical device and the events of which the first surgical device is situationally aware; and activating, by the control circuit, the first surgical device and the second surgical device each for a predetermined period of time when no tissue or patient is sensed.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein being situationally aware, by a control circuit within a first surgical device, comprise being situationally aware, by the control circuit within the first surgical device, of a first user using the first surgical device and a second user using the second surgical device.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein being situationally aware, by a control circuit within a first surgical device, of a first user using the first surgical device comprises being situationally aware, by the control circuit within the first surgical device, of the first user grasping a handle of the first surgical device.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising allowing a transceiver in the handle of the first surgical device to communicate with an identifier worn by the first user and allowing, by the identifier, a communication between the first surgical device and a surgical hub.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein being situationally aware, by a control circuit within a first surgical device, of a first user using the first surgical device and a second user using the second surgical device, comprises being situationally aware, by the control circuit within the first surgical device, of a location of the first surgical device and a location of the second surgical device.
15. The method of claim 14, further comprising determining, by the control circuit, the location of the second surgical device based on a wireless signal transmitted by the second surgical device to the first surgical device.
16. The method of claim 10, wherein wirelessly pairing, by the control circuit, with a second surgical device according to a usage of the first surgical device comprises wirelessly pairing, by the control circuit, with a second surgical device outside of a sterile field when the first surgical device is located within the sterile field.
17. The method of claim 10, further comprising wirelessly pairing of the control circuit with a communication device.
18. The method of claim 10, further comprises determining, by the control circuit, a distance between the first surgical device and a tissue structure within a patient.
