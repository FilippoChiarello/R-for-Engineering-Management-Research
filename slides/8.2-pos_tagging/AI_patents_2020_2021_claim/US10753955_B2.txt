<abstract>
A manufacturing computer device for dynamically adapting additive manufacturing of a part is provided. The manufacturing computer device includes at least one processor in communication with at least one memory device. The at least one memory device stores a build file for building the part including a plurality of geometries that each include one or more values of a first build parameter. The processor is programmed to receive sensor information of a build of the part by a machine, compare the sensor information for each geometry of the plurality of geometries to the corresponding one or more values of the first build parameter, determine one or more values for a second build parameter for each of the geometries based on the one or more differences, and generate an updated build file for the part including the one or more values for the second build parameter.
