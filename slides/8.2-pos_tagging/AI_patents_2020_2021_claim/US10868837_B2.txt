<title>
Media device content review and management
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods may be provided to monitor media content on a monitored media device, including multimedia content, to determine whether the content is appropriate for the monitored device or devices, and to take action to remove, filter or otherwise block inappropriate content. The content monitored may include, for example, content such as audio content, video content, images, and text.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A system for device monitoring, comprising: an electronic monitored device, comprising a communications transceiver; a monitoring and analysis circuit, wherein the monitoring and analysis circuit: monitors media content received by, transmitted by, or generated by the electronic monitored device; analyzes the monitored media content and identifies any monitored media content that exceeds a content tolerance level established for that device as flagged content; and transmits the flagged content and derived data derived from the flagged content to a server to determine if the flagged content exceeds the media content tolerance level for the monitored device.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein monitored media content comprises a screen capture of the electronic monitored device screen.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the content tolerance level established for the device is associated with a user or group of users.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the monitoring and analysis circuit is located in the monitored device.
5. The system of claim 1, wherein the monitoring and analysis circuit is located on a server in communication with the electronic monitored device.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the monitoring and analysis circuit employs at least one of optical character recognition, image recognition, image classification, text recognition, voice recognition, speech recognition, and pattern recognition to monitor the media content.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the derived data is used by the monitoring and analysis circuit or the server to determine a probability that the captured media content contains inappropriate content.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the derived data comprises text extracted from the captured media content.
9. The system of claim 1, wherein the derived data comprises an identification of a third party associated with the captured media content.
10. A method for monitoring a device, the method comprising the operations of: monitoring media content on an electronic user device; analyzing the monitored media content to identify monitored media content that exceeds a content tolerance level established for the electronic user device; generating derived data from flagged media content determined to exceed the content tolerance level; and generating an alert to a second electronic user device if the flagged content exceeds the media content tolerance level for the monitored device.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising transmitting the derived data to a server to determine if the flagged content exceeds the media content tolerance level for the monitored device.
12. The method of claim 10, wherein monitored media content comprises a screen capture of on electronic user device.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein the content tolerance level established for the electronic user device is associated with a user or group of users.
14. The method of claim 10, wherein the content tolerance level established for the electronic user device is based on tolerance setting established by the second electronic user device.
15. The method of claim 10, further comprising receiving from the second electronic user device feedback comprising an indication as to whether or not the flagged content displayed to the user constitutes inappropriate material.
16. The method of claim 10, further comprising transmitting the flagged media content to the second electronic user device.
17. The method of claim 10, further comprising transmitting data associated with the flagged media content to the second electronic user device.
18. The method of claim 10, wherein the derived data comprises an identification of a third party associated with the captured media content.
19. The method of claim 10, wherein the derived data is used by a circuit on the electronic user device to determine a probability that the captured media content contains inappropriate content.
20. The method of claim 19, wherein the derived data comprises one or more of text extracted from the captured media content or an identification of a third party associated with the captured media content.
