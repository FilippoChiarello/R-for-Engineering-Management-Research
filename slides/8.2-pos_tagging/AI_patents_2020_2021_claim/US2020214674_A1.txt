METHODS AND APPARATUSES FOR ULTRASOUND DATA COLLECTION
</title>

<abstract>
Aspects of the technology described herein relate to determining, by a processing device in operative communication with an ultrasound device, a position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device, and displaying on a display screen of the processing device, based on the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device, an instruction for moving the ultrasound device.

<claims>
1. A method of operating an ultrasound system, comprising: determining, by a processing device in operative communication with an ultrasound device, a position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device; and displaying on a display screen of the processing device, based on the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device, an instruction for moving the ultrasound device.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device comprises using a video collected by the processing device.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the video depicts the ultrasound device.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device comprises using sensor data from the ultrasound device, wherein the sensor data comprises data collected by an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and/or a magnetometer on the ultrasound device.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device comprises using sensor data from the processing device, wherein the sensor data comprises data collected by an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and/or a magnetometer on the processing device.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein determining the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device comprises using a statistical model.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein displaying the instruction for moving the ultrasound device comprises: translating and/or rotating a directional indicator in three-dimensional space based on the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device; and projecting that three-dimensional arrow into two-dimensional space for display on the display screen of the processing device.
8. An apparatus, comprising: a processing device in operative communication with an ultrasound device, the processing device configured to: determine a position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device; and display on a display screen of the processing device, based on the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device, an instruction for moving the ultrasound device.
9. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the processing device is configured, when determining the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device, to use a video collected by the processing device.
10. The apparatus of claim 9, wherein the video depicts the ultrasound device.
11. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the processing device is configured, when determining the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device, to use sensor data from the ultrasound device, wherein the sensor data comprises data collected by an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and/or a magnetometer on the ultrasound device.
12. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the processing device is configured, when determining the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device, to use sensor data from the processing device, wherein the sensor data comprises data collected by an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and/or a magnetometer on the processing device.
13. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the processing device is configured, when determining the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device, to use a statistical model.
14. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein the processing device is configured, when displaying the instruction for moving the ultrasound device, to: translating and/or rotating a directional indicator in three-dimensional space based on the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device; and projecting that three-dimensional arrow into two-dimensional space for display on the display screen of the processing device.
15. A non-transitory computer readable medium comprising processor-executable instructions which, when executed, cause a processor on a processing device in operative communication with an ultrasound device to: determine a position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device; and display on a display screen of the processing device, based on the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device, an instruction for moving the ultrasound device.
16. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, wherein the instructions for determining the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device comprise instructions which, when executed, cause the processor to use a video collected by the processing device.
17. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 16, wherein the video depicts the ultrasound device.
18. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, wherein the instructions for determining the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device comprise instructions which, when executed, cause the processor to use sensor data from the ultrasound device, wherein the sensor data comprises data collected by an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and/or a magnetometer on the ultrasound device.
19. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, wherein the instructions for determining the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device comprise instructions which, when executed, cause the processor to use sensor data from the processing device, wherein the sensor data comprises data collected by an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and/or a magnetometer on the processing device.
20. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, wherein the instructions for determining the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device comprise instructions which, when executed, cause the processor to use a statistical model.
21. The non-transitory computer readable medium of claim 15, wherein the instructions for displaying the instruction for moving the ultrasound device comprise instructions which, when executed, cause the processor to: translating and/or rotating a directional indicator in three-dimensional space based on the position and/or orientation of the ultrasound device relative to the processing device; and projecting that three-dimensional arrow into two-dimensional space for display on the display screen of the processing device.
