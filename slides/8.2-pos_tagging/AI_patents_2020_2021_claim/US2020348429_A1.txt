TSUNAMI DETECTION SYSTEM WITH DATA STORAGE DEVICES IN AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES
</title>

<abstract>
A method of underwater tsunami detection includes detecting a trigger event using disruption of at least one of a plurality of hard disk drives (HDDs), each different one of the plurality of HDDs in a different one of a plurality of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). A time and location of each of the at least one HDD for the trigger event is logged. Based on at least one of the HDD disruptions, times, and locations of the at least one HDD of the plurality of HDDs, a size, strength, and direction of a tsunami caused by the trigger event is determined. Information regarding the tsunami is transmitted to a monitoring station.

<claims>
1. A method of underwater tsunami detection, comprising: detecting a trigger event using disruption of at least one of a plurality of hard disk drives (HDDs), each different one of the plurality of HDDs in a different one of a plurality of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs); logging a time and location of each of the at least one HDD for the trigger event; determining based on at least one of the HDD disruptions, times, and locations of the at least one HDD of the plurality of HDDs, a size, strength, and direction of a tsunami caused by the trigger event; and transmitting information regarding the tsunami to a monitoring station.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the HDDs are synchronized to a common time.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the location of each of the plurality of HDDs is determined by a position determining system for the AUV associated with each HDD.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein detecting comprises detecting a low frequency disturbance at the HDD.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein detecting the low frequency disturbance is accomplished using a servo off-track disruption determination.
6. The method of claim 4, wherein detecting the low frequency disturbance is accomplished using an accelerometer based detection.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein detecting with the accelerometer based detection comprises detecting using a rotational vibration (RV) sensor.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein detecting using the RV sensor comprises detecting vibration outside the HDD, and feeding forward information about the disturbance for measurement thereof to a frequency detector to determine presence of tsunami induced vibration.
9. The method of claim 4, wherein detecting a low frequency disturbance comprises detecting using a position error signal (PES).
10. The method of claim 9, wherein detecting using the PES comprises: feeding the PES directly from a recording head stack assembly of the HDD, and measuring a difference between a commanded position and an actual position as measured by a servo sector written on media of the HDD.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein detecting a trigger event is performed in a predetermined frequency bandwidth.
12. An underwater tsunami detection system, comprising: a plurality of hard disk drives (HDDs) each configured to be disposed in one of a plurality of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs); a communication network between the plurality of HDDs and a monitoring station; a navigation system providing position information for each of the plurality of HDDs; and a detection module on each of the plurality of HDDs, the detection module configured to: detect a trigger event using HDD disruption; log a time and location of the disruption in each of the HDDs that detects a disruption; determine based on at least one of the HDD disruption, time, and position, a size, strength, and direction of a tsunami caused by the trigger event; and transmit information on the communication network regarding the tsunami to the monitoring station.
13. The underwater tsunami detection system of claim 12, wherein the communication network maintains a common time.
14. The underwater tsunami detection system of claim 12, wherein each detection module is further configured to detect a low frequency disturbance at the HDD.
15. The underwater tsunami detection system of claim 14, wherein each detection module is configured to detect the low frequency disturbance using a servo off-track disruption determination.
16. The underwater tsunami detection system of claim 14, wherein each detection module is configured to detect the low frequency disturbance using rotational vibration (RV) sensor.
17. The underwater tsunami detection system of claim 16, wherein each detection module is configured to detect using the RV sensor by detecting vibration outside the HDD, and feeding forward information about the disturbance for measurement thereof.
18. The underwater tsunami detection system of claim 15, wherein each detection module is configured to detect a low frequency disturbance by: detecting using a position error signal (PES); feeding the PES directly from a recording head stack assembly of the HDD to a frequency detector for detection of a tsunami frequency vibration, and measuring a difference between a commanded position and an actual position as measured by a servo sector written on media of the HDD.
19. The underwater tsunami detection system of claim 12, wherein each detection module is configured to detect a trigger event in a predetermined frequency bandwidth.
20. An autonomous underwater vehicle, comprising: a vehicle body with a propulsion system, a communication system, an internal navigation system, and a computer-control for directing vehicle operation; and a hard disk drive (HDD) with disturbance detection, the HDD configured to detect and log a disruption associated with a tsunami, and upon detection, to effect transmission of information regarding the disruption to a monitoring station.
