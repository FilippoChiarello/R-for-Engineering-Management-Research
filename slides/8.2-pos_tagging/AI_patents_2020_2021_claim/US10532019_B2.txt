<title>
Botulinum nanoemulsions
</title>

<abstract>
The embodiment described herein are related nanoemulsions comprising botulinum toxins. In one embodiment, the nanoemulsions are prepared by high pressure microfluidization and comprise a particle size distribution exclusively between 10 and 300 nm. The nanoemulsions contemplated by the present invention are useful for the cosmetic and medical treatment of muscular contracture states. For example, botulinum toxin may relax facial muscles such that skin wrinkles become smoother and less noticeable. Further, the present invention contemplates a cosmetic formulation that may be self-administered, for example, in the privacy of one's home and without medical supervision.

<claims>
1. A sterile liquid pharmaceutical composition formulated for administration by injection, which composition comprises: a nanoparticle composition that is an oil-in-water or water-in-oil nanoemulsion in that oily particles are dispersed within an aqueous dispersion medium or aqueous particles are dispersed within an oily dispersion medium, wherein the nanoemulsion comprises: an oil; an aqueous medium; and a surfactant, wherein the oil and surfactant are present at a ratio of oil to surfactant within a range of 0.5-2, and wherein the nanoparticle composition further comprises a botulinum toxin.
2. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the nanoemulsion is characterized by a zeta potential within a range of âˆ’25 mV to +25 mV.
3. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the nanoemulsion is characterized in that a majority of its particles have diameters between approximately 10 and approximately 300 nanometers.
4. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the nanoparticle composition is substantially free of toxic solvents.
5. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the nanoparticle composition is substantially free of polymers.
6. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the nanoparticle composition is characterized by stability of a particle size feature selected from the group consisting of average particle size, maximum particle size, range of particle sizes, distribution of particle sizes, and combinations thereof for a period of time that is at least 24 months.
7. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the nanoparticle composition is substantially free of alcohols.
8. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the pharmaceutical composition does not comprise a liposome.
9. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the nanoparticle composition does not contain more than one oil and/or does not contain more than one surfactant.
10. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the oil is, or comprises, a triglyceride oil.
11. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 10, wherein the triglyceride oil is, or comprises, a triglyceride selected from the group consisting of caprylic triglyceride, capric triglyceride, and combinations thereof.
12. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the oil is soybean oil and/or the surfactant is polysorbate 80.
13. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the nanoparticle composition is characterized by improved stability of the botulinum toxin in the composition as compared with botulinum toxin in a free solution.
14. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 13, wherein the improved stability is observed under a condition selected from the group consisting of heat, alkaline conditions, acidic conditions, degradative enzymes, host organism antibodies, and combinations thereof.
15. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the nanoparticle composition is characterized in that the botulinum toxin present in the nanoparticle composition shows less surface denaturation than is observed for botulinum toxin in an otherwise comparable free solution preparation.
16. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, wherein the pharmaceutical composition is disposed within a device.
17. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 16, wherein the device is a syringe without a needle.
18. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 16, wherein the device is a patch comprising at least one needle.
19. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 16, wherein the device is a patch comprising a plurality of needles.
20. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 18, wherein the patch includes an adhesive.
21. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 18, wherein the patch is heat activated.
22. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 18, wherein the patch comprises a depot.
23. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 22, wherein the depot contains botulinum toxin, so that pressure applied to the patch causes botulinum toxin to be directed out of the patch.
24. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, administered to treat hyperhidrosis.
25. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 1, administered to treat facial lines.
