</title>

<abstract>
An information processing apparatus, an information processing method, and a program, which make it possible for a user to listen to an audio signal more appropriately are provided. An information processing apparatus, including: behavior recognition unit configured to recognize behavior of a user on a basis of sensing information of at least one of the user and an environment; a processing controller configured to control, on a basis of the recognized behavior of the user, signal processing with respect to at least one of an audio signal listened to by the user, a noise reduction signal, and an external sound monitor signal; and a signal processing unit configured to execute the signal processing.
