APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR PREDICTING DEFORMATION TEMPERATURE OF COAL USING PREDICTIVE MODEL
</title>

<abstract>
An apparatus and method predict an initial deformation temperature of coal without an additional test by using a predictive model. The apparatus includes a parameter extractor configured to analyze characteristics of test coal and to extract parameters of the test coal based on the test coal characteristic analysis; a temperature analyzer configured to analyze an initial deformation temperature (IDT) of the test coal; a modeler configured to derive an IDT predictive model for predicting the test coal IDT using the extracted parameters of the test coal and the test coal IDT; and a predictor configured to predict an initial deformation temperature (IDT) of target coal to be supplied to the coal-fired power plant by substituting parameters of the target coal into the IDT predictive model. The test coal characteristics are analyzed by ash component analysis, elementary analysis, industrial analysis, or calorific value analysis.
