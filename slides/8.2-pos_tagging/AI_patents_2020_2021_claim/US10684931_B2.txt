<title>
Pattern based behavior model for system management
</title>

<abstract>
An approach for providing guidance and management of a data processing system. A processor stores at least one design pattern corresponding to a plurality of components of the data processing system. A processor generates a behavioral model of the data processing system based, at least in part, on the stored at least one design pattern. A processor monitors actual behavior of the data processing system. A processor compares the actual behavior of the data processing system to the behavioral model of the data processing system. A processor recommends a solution, based, at least in part, on the comparison.

<claims>
1. A method for providing guidance and management of a data processing system, the method comprising: storing, by one or more processors, at least one design pattern corresponding to a plurality of components of the data processing system, wherein: the at least one design pattern is represented as a set of text descriptions and a metamodel; the metamodel is defined in the web ontology language (OWL); and the at least one design pattern describes a problem, a solution to the problem, and benefits and liabilities associated with using the solution; generating, by one or more processors, a behavioral model of the data processing system based, at least in part, on the stored at least one design pattern, wherein: the behavioral model is a pattern based behavioral model of the data processing system; and the behavioral model includes annotations to the metadata with pattern names that refer to component behavior; monitoring, by one or more processors, actual behavior of the data processing system; comparing, by one or more processors, the actual behavior of the data processing system to the behavioral model of the data processing system; and recommending, by one or more processors, a solution, based, at least in part, on the comparison wherein the solution: (i) is defined in terms of a collection of the plurality of components; and (ii) comprises a suggestion of modifications to the behavioral model based on properties that emerge as a consequence of how the plurality of components are connected together.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein generating the behavioral model of the data processing system comprises: receiving, by one or more processors, system data and metadata; matching, by one or more processors, the system data and the metadata to the stored at least one design pattern; annotating, by one or more processors, the system data and the metadata to indicate an association with the at least one design pattern; and storing, by one or more processors, the annotated system data and the annotated metadata.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein monitoring actual behavior of the data processing system comprises receiving system information, wherein the system information is information describing behavior of the data processing system that includes a record of missing log entries and errors.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising: performing an action, by one or more processors, on the at least one design pattern corresponding to the plurality of components of the data processing system.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the action includes creating, modifying, merging, and deleting.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the properties include system latency, system reliability, and system flexibility.
