METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETECTING A SLEEP STATE
</title>

<abstract>
The object of the invention is a method and device for detecting a sleep state by means of heart-rate and movement data. By means of neural network software, a sleep state is detected using as input data movement data (move_count) and data derived from heart-rate data and/or data derived from inter-beat interval data such as (MAD) and respiration data (RESP). In the method, at least a portion of the variables (HRD, MHR, MAD, Resp, GRD) derived from the heart-rate data/inter-beat interval data are further modified by means of one, most preferably 2-4, artificial average functions and the cumulative sleep time is one input datum.
