<title>
A GATEWAY AND METHOD FOR TRANSFORMING A DESCRIPTION OF AN INDUSTRIAL PROCESS EQUIPMENT INTO A DATA INFORMATION MODEL
</title>

<abstract>
Modern industrial processes demand flexibility in terms of how data flows are structured in an automation pyramid. Instead of only upward and downward flows, the data should be accessible directly at each level of the pyramid. Embodiments herein generally involve a gateway for facilitating an integration of process equipment within an industrial environment supporting an open industry standard. The proposed embodiments support an integration of field devices whose characteristics, capabilities and/or requirements are expressed by a description language for industrial process equipment such as EDDL, into a contemporary communication environment enabling a direct data access, wherein the communication environment is operated on the basis of a semantically enriched and graph-based data information model such as provided by OPC UA.

<claims>
CLAIMS :
1. A gateway for transforming a description of an industrial process equipment into a semantically enriched and graph-based data information model for automation purposes, the gateway in cluding :
- a parsing module for parsing information entities in the de scription of the industrial process equipment by a field com munication protocol and for transforming the parsed infor mation entities into declarative logic facts and asserting the declarative logic facts within a deductive database;
- a knowledge engine using a mapping knowledge base for applying mapping rules to said declarative logic facts, whereby said declarative logic facts are deductively mapped onto the graphbased data information model; and;
- an interface module for accessing the graph-based data object model .
2. The gateway according to claim 1, wherein the semantically enriched and graph-based data information model is an OPC UA in formation model.
3. The gateway according to claim 2, wherein a mapping rule is applied for creating an OPC UA Base Node Class using attributes taken from a corresponding variable in the description of the industrial process equipment.
4. The gateway according to claim 2, wherein a mapping rule is applied for creating an OPC UA Object node by referencing corre sponding attributes in the description of the industrial process equipment including a manufacturer identification, a device type, a device revision and a device description revision.
5. The gateway according to claim 1, wherein the description of said industrial process equipment is expressed by one of:
- an Electronic Device Description Language or EDDL; - a Field Device Tool/Device Type Manager protocol or FDT/DTM;
- a General Station Description or GSD; and;
- an 10 Device Description.
6. The gateway according to claim 1, wherein the interface mod ule is a gateway-internal OPC UA server.
7. The gateway according to claim 1, wherein the knowledge en gine is a Datalog Engine.
8. The gateway according to claim 7, wherein the knowledge en gine, the parsing module and the Datalog engine are substantial ly integrated within one functional unit.
9. The gateway according to claim 1, wherein the field communi cation protocol is a Highway Addressable Remote Transducer or HART protocol.
10. The gateway according to claim 1, including at least one equipment interface for connecting at least one industrial pro cess equipment.
11. A method for transforming a description of an industrial process equipment into a semantically enriched and graph-based data information model for automation purposes, the method in cluding the steps of:
- parsing information entities in the description of the indus trial process equipment by a field communication protocol, transforming the parsed information entities into declarative logic facts and asserting the declarative logic facts within a deductive database;
- using a mapping knowledge base for applying mapping rules to said declarative logic facts, whereby said declarative logic facts are deductively mapped onto the graph-based data infor mation model; and; - providing the graph-based data object model by an interface module .
