<title>
System and method for structures detection and multi-class image categorization in medical imaging
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method are provided to automatically categorize biological and medical images. The new system and method can incorporate a machine learning classifier in which novel ideas are provided to guide the classifier to focus on regions of interest (ROI) within medical images for categorizing or classifying the images. The system and method can ignore regions when misleading structures exist. The detection and classification of one or more features of interest within a discriminative region of interest within an image are rendered invariant to differences in translation, orientation and/or scaling of the one or more features of interest within the medical image(s). The system and method allow a processor to more quickly, efficiently and accurately process and categorize medical images.

<claims>
1. A method for categorizing biological or medical images, comprising: a) obtaining a plurality of biological or medical images depicting one or more structures; b) providing and using a family of multi-resolution, multi-orientation geometric templates that is made translation, orientation and/or scaling invariant by computing correlation with the templates at selected pixels within the images; c) detecting the one or more structures within the images based on the computed correlation; and d) categorizing the biological or medical images by the one or more structures detected.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the geometric templates are selected from the group consisting of geometric templates of manufactured parts, biological or medical anatomical applications.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the step of computing correlation is carried out using a parameter selected from the group consisting of a template correlation value, a relative size of the region with respect to the original image size, a Euclidean distance measured between the center of the region C={cx, cy} and a center of the image, a location of the top left corner of the region within the image, a location of the bottom right corner of the region, and combinations thereof.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the step (c) of detecting the one or more structures includes discriminating between the image of the one or more structures and misleading structures in the biological or medical images.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the family of geometric templates is based on clinical knowledge of known biology or anatomy.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of computing correlation is carried out using a parameter selected from the group consisting of a template correlation value, a relative size of the region with respect to the original image size, a Euclidean distance measured between the center of the region C={cx, cy} and a center of the image, a location of the top left corner of the region within the image, a location of the bottom right corner of the region, and combinations thereof.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the correlation is carried out in the spatial or the Fourier domain.
8. The method of claim 6, wherein the step of detecting the one or more structures within the images involves a machine learning technique to look for features in a representative region or regions within the images to be categorized.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the machine learning technique is a Random Forests machine learning technique.
10. The method of claim 6, wherein the family of geometric templates is based on clinical knowledge of known biology or anatomy.
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the correlation is carried out in the spatial or the Fourier domain.
12. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of detecting the one or more structures within the images involves a machine learning technique to look for features in a representative region or regions within the images to be categorized.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the machine learning technique is a Random Forests machine learning technique.
14. A system for categorizing clinical or biological images, comprising: at least one device for receiving a plurality of biological images depicting one or more structures and a family of multi-resolution, multi-orientation geometric templates that is made translation, orientation and/or scaling invariant by computing correlation at selected pixels within the images; at least one computing device; and an application executable in the at least one computing device, the application comprising logic that: a) uses the family of multi-resolution, multi-orientation geometric templates by computing correlation with the templates at the selected pixels within the images; b) detects the one or more structures within the images based on the computed correlation; and c) categorizes the biological or medical images by the one or more structures detected.
15. A non-transitory computer readable medium employing a program executable in at least one computing device, comprising code that: a) receives a plurality of the biological or medical images depicting one or more structures and a family of multi-resolution, multi-orientation geometric templates that is made translation, orientation and/or scaling invariant; b) uses the family of multi-resolution, multi-orientation geometric templates by computing correlation with the templates at the selected pixels within the images; c) detects the one or more structures within the images based on the computed correlation; and d) categorizes the biological or medical images by the one or more structures detected.
