METHOD AND DEVICE FOR AUTOMATICALLY MANAGING AUDIO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL MESSAGES ON BOARD AN AIRCRAFT
</title>

<abstract>
A device comprises a transcription unit for transcribing an audio message received from the air traffic control into a text message, a processing unit for extracting first indications from the text message, a transcription unit for transcribing, into a restated text message, a restated audio message transmitted by the pilot to the air traffic control after the reception of the audio message, a processing unit for extracting second indications from the restated text message, a comparison unit for comparing the first and second indications and a warning unit for transmitting a warning to the pilot if a difference between the first and second indications is detected, so as to notify the pilot that they have misunderstood the audio message from air traffic control.

<claims>
1. A method for automatically managing audio air traffic control messages on board an aircraft, which messages are transmitted by a transmitter from an air traffic controller and are received on board the aircraft by means of at least one radio communication unit, said method comprising: a first phase comprising at least the following steps, which are automatically and successively implemented when an audio message is received on board the aircraft by the radio communication unit: transcribing the received audio message into a text message in a first transcription step, implemented by a first transcription unit; and processing said text message so as to extract indications, called first indications, from said text message in a first processing step, implemented by a first processing unit; a second phase implemented after said first phase during the transmission of an audio message, called restated audio message, transmitted by a pilot to the air traffic controller after reception of said audio message, the second phase comprising at least the following steps, which are implemented automatically and successively: transcribing the restated audio message into a text message, called restated text message in a second transcription step, implemented by a second transcription unit; processing said restated text message so as to extract indications, called second indications, from said restated text message in a second processing step, implemented by a second processing unit; comparing at least part of said second indications with at least part of said first indications so as to be able to detect, if applicable, at least one difference between said first and second indications in a comparison step, implemented by a comparison unit; and transmitting a warning to the pilot if at least one difference between said first and second indications is detected in the comparison step in a warning step, implemented by a warning unit.
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first processing step also involves extracting from said text message an identifier of the aircraft that receives the audio message, wherein said first phase comprises an additional comparison step, implemented by an additional comparison unit, involving comparing said extracted identifier with an identifier of the aircraft on board which said method is implemented, and wherein said second phase is only implemented if the two identifiers are identical.
3. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first processing step also involves extracting from said text message an identifier of the aircraft that receives the audio message, wherein said first phase comprises an additional comparison step, implemented by an additional comparison unit, involving comparing said extracted identifier with an identifier of the aircraft on board which said method is implemented, and wherein said second phase is only implemented if one of the following two situations occurs: a first situation, when the two identifiers are identical; a second situation, when the two identifiers are different but the pilot has sent a restated audio message to the air traffic control within a time period that is less than a predefined duration following the reception of the audio message originating from the air traffic control.
4. The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein, in the second situation, if the second indications contained in the restated audio message transmitted by the pilot at least partly correspond to the first indications contained in the audio message received from the air traffic control, the warning step transmits a warning to the pilot to alert them that they are not the recipient of the audio message.
5. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the warning step involves displaying an indication allowing the pilot to identify the at least one difference between the first and second compared indications.
6. A device for automatically managing audio air traffic control messages on board an aircraft, which messages are transmitted by a transmitter from an air traffic controller and are received on board the aircraft by means of a radio communication unit, said device comprising: a first transcription unit configured to transcribe the received audio message into a text message; and a first processing unit configured to process said text message so as to extract indications, called first indications, from said text message; a second transcription unit configured to transcribe an audio message, called restated audio message, transmitted by the pilot to the air traffic control into a text message, called restated message, after the reception of said audio message; a second processing unit configured to process said restated text message so as to extract indications, called second indications, from said restated text message; a comparison unit configured to compare at least part of said second indications with at least part of said first indications so as to be able to detect, if applicable, at least one difference between said first and second indications; and a warning unit configured to transmit a warning to the pilot if at least one difference between said first and second indications is detected by the comparison unit.
7. The device as claimed in claim 6, wherein the first processing unit is also configured to extract from said text message an identifier of the aircraft that receives the audio message, in that said device comprises an additional comparison unit configured to compare said extracted identifier with an identifier of the aircraft provided with said device.
8. The device as claimed in claim 6, wherein the warning unit comprises a display unit configured to display at least one indication allowing the pilot to identify, if applicable, the at least one difference between the first and second indications.
9. The device as claimed in claim 6, wherein said first and second transcription units correspond to the one and the same transcription unit, and wherein said first and second processing units correspond to the one and the same processing unit.
10. An aircraft, comprising a device as specified in claim 6.
