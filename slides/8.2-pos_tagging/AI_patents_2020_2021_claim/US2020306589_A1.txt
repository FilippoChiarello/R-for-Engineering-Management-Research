SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR REAL-TIME FEEDBACK AND ATHLETIC TRAINING ON A SMART USER DEVICE
</title>

<abstract>
A smart exercise device configured to present a user with a user interface at least partially via a display, receive a selection of a trainer via the user interface and communicate the selection to a cloud service via the communication interface, receive a selection of an exercise associated, download a video of the selected exercise, the video comprising a training portion, cause the training portion of the video to be displayed while simultaneously activating the camera in order to capture video of the user performing actions depicted in the training portion of the video, analyze the captured video in order to match movements of the user depicted in the video to movements in the training portion of the video, generate trackable feedback, and provide the feedback via the user interface.

<claims>
1. A smart exercise device comprising: a camera configured to capture video of a user of the smart exercise device; a display; a communication interface configured to allow the smart exercise device to communicate with a cloud service; a processor configured to execute instructions, the instructions configured to cause the processor to perform the steps of: present the user with a user interface at least partially via the display, receive a selection of a trainer via the user interface and communicate the selection to the cloud service via the communication interface, receive a selection of an exercise associated with the trainer via the user interface and communicate the selection to the cloud service via the communication interface, download a video of the selected exercise via the communication interface, the video comprising a training portion, cause the training portion of the video to be displayed on the display while simultaneously activating the camera in order to capture video of the user performing actions depicted in the training portion of the video, analyze the captured video in order to match movements of the user depicted in the video to movements in the training portion of the video, generate trackable feedback, and provide the feedback via the user interface.
2. The smart exercise device of claim 1, wherein providing feedback comprises causing an avatar to be displayed on the display, wherein the avatar mimics the movements of the user, and color coding portions of the avatar to indicate whether the user is properly matching the movements in the training portion of the video.
3. The smart device of claim 1, wherein providing feedback comprises providing audible feedback via the user interface.
4. The smart device of claim 1, wherein analyzing the captured video comprises performing key point extraction, key feature extraction and key frame extraction.
5. The smart device of claim 1, wherein the instructions are further configured to cause the processor to compute performance metrics that are communicated to the cloud service vis the communication interface to the cloud service for storage.
6. A user device comprising: a camera configured to capture video of a user; a display; a processor configured to execute instructions, the instructions configured to cause the processor to perform the steps of: present the user with a user interface at least partially via the display, receive a selection of a trainer via the user interface, receive a selection of an exercise associated with the trainer via the user interface, load a video of the selected exercise, the video comprising a training portion, cause the training portion of the video to be displayed on the display while simultaneously activating the camera in order to capture video of the user performing actions depicted in the training portion of the video, analyze the captured video in order to match movements of the user depicted in the video to movements in the training portion of the video, generate trackable feedback, and provide the feedback via the user interface.
7. The device of claim 6, wherein providing feedback comprises causing an avatar to be displayed on the display, wherein the avatar mimics the movements of the user, and color coding portions of the avatar to indicate whether the user is properly matching the movements in the training portion of the video.
8. The device of claim 6, wherein providing feedback comprises providing audible feedback via the user interface.
9. The device of claim 6, wherein analyzing the captured video comprises performing key point extraction, key feature extraction and key frame extraction.
10. The device of claim 6, wherein the instructions are further configured to cause the processor to compute performance metrics that are communicated to the cloud service vis the communication interface to the cloud service for storage.
11. The device of claim 6, further comprising a communication interface configured to allow the smart exercise device to communicate with a cloud service, wherein the instructions are further configured to cause the processor to communicate the trainer and the exercise selection to the cloud service via the communication interface and to download the video from the cloud service via the communication interface.
12. The device of claim 6, where in the selected exercise is part of a workout plan, and wherein the instructions are further configured to cause the processor to load a series of videos related to the workout plan.
