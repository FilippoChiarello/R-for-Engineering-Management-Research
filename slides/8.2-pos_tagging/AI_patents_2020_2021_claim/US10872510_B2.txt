<title>
Home emergency guidance and advisement system
</title>

<abstract>
An emergency guidance and advisement system is provided to automatically determine a floor map of a building and using the floor map for advising how to exit the building during an emergency, such as a fire. The system can automatically create an escape plan, based on pre-disaster and in-disaster motion detection of users within the home, and provide dynamic advisement to guide users out of the home during an emergency.

<claims>
1. A system comprising: a central monitoring system for monitoring a building; user detectors configured to detect the presence of users within the building; fire detectors configured to detect locations of fires within the building; and signaling devices configured to emit signals to indicate an exit route for exiting the building; wherein the central monitoring system is configured to: receive user presence information from the user detectors; use the user presence information to determine a floormap of the building, the floormap indicating routes within the building, including exits out of the building; receive fire indication information from the fire detectors located within the building, the fire indication information indicating one or more locations within the building that may have a fire; predict locations of the users within the building based at least in part on the fire indication information; determine, based on the floormap, the fire indication information, and the predicted locations of the users, one or more exit routes that can be used by the users to exit the building, the exit routes avoiding the locations within the building that may have the fire; and send signaling instructions to the signaling devices for the signaling devices to emit a signal to indicate to the users an exit route to exit the building.
2. The system of claim 1, wherein each given user detector is configured to detect motion of users in proximity to the given user detector.
3. The system of claim 1, wherein the emitted signals comprise voice commands.
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the emitted signals comprise light signals.
5. The system of claim 4, wherein the light signals comprise directional signals that direct users to an exit route.
6. The system of claim 1, wherein the fire indication information comprises temperature readings.
7. The system of claim 1, wherein the fire indication information comprises a rate of change of temperature readings.
8. The system of claim 1, wherein the central monitoring system includes an improvement engine configured to employ a machine learning model to predict the locations of the users.
9. The system of claim 8, further comprising: a training system that implements the machine learning model to generate the floormap based at least in part on the user presence information.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the training system implements the machine learning model designed to generate the exit routes based at least in part of the floormap.
11. A method for automatically guiding users out of a building during an emergency, the method comprising: receiving user presence information from user detectors; determining a floormap of the building based on the user presence information, the floormap indicating routes within the building, the routes including exits out of the building; receiving fire indication information from fire detectors located within the building, the fire indication information indicating one or more locations within the building that may have a fire; predicting locations of the users within the building based at least in part on the fire indication information; determining, based on the floormap, the fire indication information, and the predicted locations of the users, one or more exit routes that can be used by the users to exit the building, the exit routes avoiding the locations within the building that may have the fire; and sending signaling instructions to signaling devices for the signaling devices to emit a signal to indicate to the users at least one of the exit routes to exit the building.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein each given user detector is configured to detect motion of users in proximity to the given user detector.
13. The method of claim 11, wherein the emitted signals comprise voice commands.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein the emitted signals comprise light signals.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the light signals comprise directional signals that direct users to an exit route.
16. The method of claim 11, wherein the fire indication information comprises temperature readings.
17. The method of claim 11, wherein the fire indication information comprises a rate of change of temperature readings.
18. The method of claim 11, wherein predicting the locations of the users comprises: determining, using a machine learning model based on the fire indication information, the locations of the users within the building.
19. The method of claim 11, further comprising: training the machine learning model to generate the floormap based at least in part on the user presence information.
20. The method of claim 19, further comprising: training the machine learning model to generate the exit routes based at least in part on the floormap.
