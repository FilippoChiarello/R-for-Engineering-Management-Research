IDENTITY RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND IDENTITY RECOGNITION METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An identity recognition system includes a target region acquisition module, a photoplethysmography signal conversion module, a biometric characteristic conversion module, a face characteristic acquisition module, and a comparison module. The target region acquisition module is configured to acquire a plurality of target region images from a plurality of face images. The photoplethysmography signal conversion module is configured to generate a photoplethysmography signal according to the target region images. The biometric characteristic conversion module is configured to convert the photoplethysmography signal into a biometric characteristic. The face characteristic acquisition module is configured to acquire a face characteristic from the face images. The comparison module is configured to fuse the face characteristic and the biometric characteristic into a fused characteristic and perform similarity calculation on the fused characteristic and a plurality of fused characteristics stored in a database to determine identity of an identified person.
