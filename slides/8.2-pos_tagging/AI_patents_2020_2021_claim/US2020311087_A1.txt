DATABASE TOOL
</title>

<abstract>
A memory stores a first and second cache. A processor stores a first query in a transaction log. The processor selects information from the transaction log, uses it to determine that a user will likely access a first portion of the database at a future date, and copies that portion into the first cache prior to the date. The processor further copies a second, frequently accessed portion of the database into the second cache. The processor additionally determines that a portion of data is in both caches and deletes it from the second cache. The processor receives a second query from the user, determines that it is directed at data in the first cache and accesses that cache. The processor also determines that the second query is not directed at data in the first cache but is directed at data in the second cache, and accesses that cache.

<claims>
1. An apparatus comprising: a memory configured to store: a first cache; and a second cache; and a hardware processor communicatively coupled to the memory, the hardware processor configured to: store a first query submitted by a user to a database in a transaction log; select a set of information from the transaction log, and store the set of information in a repository, the set of information comprising: the first query; the date the user submitted the first query; and an identification of the user; determine, based on the set of information, that a probability that the user will access a first portion of the database at a future date is greater than a set threshold; upon determining that the probability that the user will access the first portion of the database at the future date is greater than the set threshold, copy the first portion of the database into the first cache prior to the future date; determine a second portion of the database that the user accesses at a frequency greater than a set frequency; and upon determining the second portion of the database that the user accesses at the frequency greater than the set frequency, copy the second portion of the database into the second cache.
2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the process of determining, based on the set of information, that the probability that the user will access the first portion of the database at the future date is greater than the set threshold, comprises using a machine learning model.
3. The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the machine learning model is a logistic regression model.
4. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the hardware processor is further configured to remove information from the repository that is older than a set date.
5. The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the set date is adjustable by the user.
6. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the set threshold is adjustable by the user.
7. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the set frequency is adjustable by the user.
8. A method comprising: storing a first query submitted by a user to a database in a transaction log; selecting a set of information from the transaction log, and storing the set of information in a repository, the set of information comprising: the first query; the date the user submitted the first query; and an identification of the user; determining, based on the set of information, that a probability that the user will access a first portion of the database at a future date is greater than a set threshold; upon determining that the probability that the user will access the first portion of the database at the future date is greater than the set threshold, copying the first portion of the database into the first cache prior to the future date; determining a second portion of the database that the user accesses at a frequency greater than a set frequency; and upon determining the second portion of the database that the user accesses at the frequency greater than the set frequency, copying the second portion of the database into the second cache.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the process of determining, based on the set of information, that the probability that the user will access the first portion of the database at the future date is greater than the set threshold, comprises using a machine learning model.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the machine learning model is a logistic regression model.
11. The method of claim 8, further comprising removing information from the repository that is older than a set date.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the set date is adjustable by the user.
13. The method of claim 8, wherein the set threshold is adjustable by the user.
14. The method of claim 8, wherein the set frequency is adjustable by the user.
15. A system comprising: a storage element operable to store: a first cache; and a second cache; and a processing element communicatively coupled to the storage element and operable to: store a first query submitted by a user to a database in a transaction log; select a set of information from the transaction log, and store the set of information in a repository, the set of information comprising: the first query; the date the user submitted the first query; and an identification of the user; determine, using a machine learning model, based on the set of information, that a probability that the user will access a first portion of the database at a future date is greater than a set threshold; upon determining that the probability that the user will access the first portion of the database at the future date is greater than the set threshold, copy the first portion of the database into the first cache prior to the future date; determine a second portion of the database that the user accesses at a frequency greater than a set frequency; and upon determining the second portion of the database that the user accesses at the frequency greater than the set frequency, copy the second portion of the database into the second cache.
16. The system of claim 15, wherein the machine learning model is a logistic regression model.
17. The system of claim 15, wherein the processing element is further operable to information from the repository that is older than a set date.
18. The system of claim 17, wherein the set date is adjustable by the user.
19. The system of claim 15, wherein the set threshold is adjustable by the user.
20. The system of claim 15, wherein the set frequency is adjustable by the user.
