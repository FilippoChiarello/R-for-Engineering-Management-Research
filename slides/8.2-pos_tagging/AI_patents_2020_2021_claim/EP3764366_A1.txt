<title>
UNCERTAINTY MAPS FOR DEEP LEARNING ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES TOMOGRAPHY
</title>

<abstract>
The present disclosure relates to a method for determining electrical properties, EP, of a target volume (708) in an imaged subject (718). The method comprises: a) training (201) a deep neural network, DNN, using a training dataset, the training dataset comprising training B1 field maps and corresponding EP maps, the training comprising using a monte carlo, MC, dropout of the DNN during the training, resulting in a trained DNN configured for generating EP maps from B1 field maps; b) receiving (203) an input B1 field map of the target volume, and repeatedly generate by the trained DNN from the input B1 field map an EP map, resulting in a set of EP maps, wherein the generating comprises using in each repetition the MC dropout during inference of the DNN; c) combining (205) the set of EP maps for determining an EP map and associated uncertainty map of the input B1 field map.
