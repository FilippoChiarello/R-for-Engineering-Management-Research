<title>
Systems and methods for user authentication using pattern-based risk assessment and adjustment
</title>

<abstract>
A computer-implemented method is provided for authenticating an identity of a user requesting access to a computerized resource via a client computing device. The method includes receiving, by the client computing device, a request to authenticate the identity of the user, determining, by the client computing device, a time period of the request, determining, by the client computing device, an approximate geolocation of the user, and determining, by the client computing device, one or more network characteristics associated with a current network of the client computing device. The method further includes transmitting, by the client computing device to an authentication device, authentication data including the request, the time period of the request, the approximate geolocation of the user and the one or network characteristics.
