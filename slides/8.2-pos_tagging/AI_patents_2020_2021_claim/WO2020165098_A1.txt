METHOD FOR DETERMINING DOWNHOLE CHARACTERISTICS IN A PRODUCTION WELL
</title>

<abstract>
A method for determining one or more downhole characteristic(s) in a production well (10), comprising the steps of: measuring (110) a physical property of the production well (10) using at least one sensor (12); pre-processing (130) the measured values of the physical property using feature scaling or automatic gain control techniques; and determining (150) one or more downhole characteristic(s) using a supervised machine learning method (200). The supervised machine learning method (200) comprises the steps of: cross- validating (210) a predictive analytics algorithm with training data that are previously measured physical properties and applying (220) one or more algorithms to the measured values of the physical property to converge on an estimate for the determined downhole characteristic(s).
