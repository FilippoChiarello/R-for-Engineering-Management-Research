ART COLOR COORDINATING MANUFACTURING METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
An art color coordinating manufacturing method includes the acquiring of a principal color and then acquiring coordinating colors of the principal color. A design is selected and modified with the coordinating colors to define an output image such that the output image coordinates with the principal color. The output image is then printed to be used as an art piece.

<claims>
I claim:
1. A method of producing a coordinating art piece including the steps of: acquiring a principal color; acquiring coordinating colors of the principal color; selecting a design; modifying the design with the coordinating colors to define an output image such that the output image coordinates with the principal color.
2. The method of producing a coordinating art piece according to claim 1, further including the step of printing the output image.
3. The method of producing a coordinating art piece according to claim 2, wherein the step of acquiring the principal color further includes finding a color value of a color on an image or object or receiving the color value from a manufacturer of the principal color.
4. The method of producing a coordinating art piece according to claim 1, wherein the step of acquiring coordinating colors further includes the steps of: determining the color value of the principal color; locating and using for the coordinating colors one or more of: a complementary color of the principal color; split-complementary colors of the complementary color; analogous colors; tetradic colors; and triadic colors.
5. The method of producing a coordinating art piece according to claim 4, wherein the step of acquiring coordinating colors further includes the step of creating different brightness, luminance and saturation adaptations of the coordinating colors to form color shades of the coordinating colors.
6. The method of producing a coordinating art piece according to claim 5, wherein the step of acquiring coordinating colors includes the step of creating different brightness, luminance and saturation adaptations of the principal color to form monochromatic shades of the principal color within the coordinating colors.
7. The method of producing a coordinating art piece according to claim 4, wherein the step of acquiring coordinating colors includes the step of creating different brightness, luminance and saturation adaptations of the principal color to form monochromatic shades of the principal color within the coordinating colors.
8. A method of producing a coordinated art piece including the steps of: selecting an image; obtaining principal and/or coordinating colors from the image; using the principal and/or coordinating colors to identify and acquire a paint complementing or matching the principal and/or coordinating colors.
9. A method of producing a coordinated art piece including the steps of: acquiring a principal color or a coordinating color of the principal color; searching through artwork in a database that incorporate the principal color or the coordinating color; selecting one of the artwork; and printing the artwork.
10. The method of producing a coordinating art piece according to claim 9, wherein the step of acquiring the principal color further includes finding a color value of the principal color from a manufacturer of the principal color.
11. The method of producing a coordinating art piece according to claim 8, wherein the step of acquiring coordinating colors further includes the steps of: determining the color value of the principal color; locating and using for the coordinating colors one or more of: a complementary color of the principal color; split-complementary colors of the complementary color; analogous colors; tetradic colors; and triadic colors.
12. The method of producing a coordinating art piece according to claim 11, wherein the step of acquiring coordinating colors further includes the step of creating different brightness, luminance and saturation adaptations of the coordinating colors to form color shades of the coordinating colors.
13. The method of producing a coordinating art piece according to claim 12, wherein the step of acquiring coordinating colors includes the step of creating different brightness, luminance and saturation adaptations of the principal color to form monochromatic shades of the principal color within the coordinating colors.
14. The method of producing a coordinating art piece according to claim 10, wherein the step of acquiring coordinating colors includes the step of creating different brightness, luminance and saturation adaptations of the principal color to form monochromatic shades of the principal color within the coordinating colors.
15. The method of producing a coordinating art piece according to claim 13, wherein the step of acquiring the principal color further includes finding a color value of the principal color from a manufacturer of the principal color.
