METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR ANALYZING OCCUPANCY IN A SPACE
</title>

<abstract>
A method and system are provided for analyzing occupancy in a space by automatically identifying a region of interest in the space based on image analysis and enabling different outputs based on detection of occupancy in the region of interest or outside it.
</abstract>

<claims>
1. A method for analyzing occupancy in a space, the method comprising detecting one or more furniture in the space, based on image analysis of a first image of the space; defining a border of a region of interest in the space, in relation to the one or more furniture detected in the first image of the space; controlling a device when occupancy is detected within the border of region of interest.
2. The method of claim 1 comprising detecting occupancy within the border of region of interest based on image analysis of a subsequent image of the space.
3. The method of claim 2 comprising detecting occupancy within the border of region of interest based on either one of color detection, shape detection, motion detection or based on a combination thereof.
4. The method of claim 2 comprising detecting occupancy within the border of region of interest by using machine learning techniques.
5. The method of claim 1 comprising detecting the furniture using one or a combination of color detection and shape detection.
6. The method of claim 1 comprising detecting the furniture using machine learning techniques.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein detecting occupancy within the border of region of interest comprises one or a combination of counting occupants, tracking occupants, determining occupants' location and determining an amount of time an occupant is at a location in a space.
8. The method of claim 7 wherein controlling a device comprises generating an alarm when a number of occupants above a pre-determined threshold is detected within the border of region of interest.
9. The method of claim 7 wherein controlling a device comprises generating an alarm when occupants are located within a predetermined distance from each other, within the border of region of interest.
10. The method of claim 1 wherein the furniture comprises either one or more of a table, a chair, a bed and a portable sanitation stand.
11. The method of claim 1 comprising detecting the furniture in the space in another image of the space; updating the border of the region of interest based on the detection; and controlling the device when occupancy is detected within the updated border.
12. A system for determining occupancy in a space, the system comprising a processor to define a border of a region of interest in the space, in relation to one or more furniture detected in a first image of the space; detect occupancy in the space based on a second image of the space; and control a device when occupancy is detected within the border of region of interest.
13. The system of claim 12 wherein the device comprises an alarm which is activated in one or more cases: i) when a number of occupants above a pre-determined threshold is detected within the border of region of interest; ii) when occupants are located within a predetermined distance from each other, within the border of region of interest; and iii) when occupants are located at a location within the border of region of interest, above a predetermined amount of time.
14. The system of claim 12 wherein the processor comprises a detector to detect a shape of an occupant in images of the space.
15. The system of claim 12 wherein the processor comprises a detector to identify a predefined occupant.
16. The system of claim 12 wherein the processor detects the furniture using one or a combination of color detection and shape detection.
17. The system of claim 12 wherein the furniture comprises either one or more of a table, a chair, a bed and a portable sanitation stand.
18. The system of claim 12 wherein the processor updates the border of the region of interest based on detecting the furniture in the space in another image of the space; and controls the device when occupancy is detected within the updated border.
