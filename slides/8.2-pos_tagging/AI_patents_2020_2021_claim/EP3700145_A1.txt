A CONTROLLER FOR ASSOCIATION OF A USER DEVICE WITH A RADIO NODE
</title>

<abstract>
A controller (CL) for association of a user device (150) with a radio node (102) in a wireless network (100) performs:- learning (201) one or more performance metric of neighbour radio nodes (101, 102, 103) or fronthaul links (L1, L2, L3) between the user device (150) and neighbour radio nodes (101, 102, 103);- determining (202) one or more cumulative performance metric for respective multi-hop paths from the neighbour radio nodes (101, 102, 103) to a destination (119) in the wireless network (100);- selecting (204) a best path (102-L9-109-L26-115-L39) according to a performance criterion combining one or more performance metric and one or more cumulative performance metric; and- selecting (205) the neighbour radio node (102) of the best path for association of the user device (150).
