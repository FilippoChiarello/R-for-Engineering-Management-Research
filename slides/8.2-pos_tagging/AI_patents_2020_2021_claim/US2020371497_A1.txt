<title>
System, Method, and Apparatus for Monitoring, Regulating, or Controlling Fluid Flow
</title>

<abstract>
A flow meter, and related system and method are provided. The flow meter includes a coupler, a support member, an image sensor, a valve, and one or more processors. The coupler is adapted to couple to a drip chamber. The support member is operatively coupled to the coupler. The image sensor has a field of view and is operatively coupled to the support member. The image sensor is positioned to view the drip chamber within the field of view. The one or more processors are operatively coupled to the image sensor to receive image data therefrom and to the actuator to actuate the valve. The one or more processors are configured to estimate a flow of fluid through the drip chamber and to actuate the valve to control the flow of fluid through the drip chamber to achieve a target flow rate.

<claims>
1. A flow meter, comprising: an image sensor; a valve comprising: a rigid chamber; a flexible tube section disposed within the rigid chamber, the flexible tube section in fluid communication with a drip chamber; a pump configured to pump fluid into or out of the rigid chamber to thereby actuate the valve; and an actuator configured to actuate the valve to thereby control the flow of fluid through the drip chamber; and at least one processor in communication with the image sensor to receive image data therefrom and with the actuator to actuate the valve, wherein the at least one processor compares an image of the image data to a reference image to estimate at least one parameter of liquid within the drip chamber and to thereby actuate the valve using the actuator in response to the at least one parameter of liquid to achieve a target flow rate.
2. The flow meter according to claim 1, wherein the at least one processor determines an existence of a free flow condition using a distortion of a background pattern caused by the liquid as indicated by the image data.
3. The flow meter according to claim 2, wherein the at least one processor determines the free flow condition exists when the liquid causes an array of lines of the background pattern to change angles by the distortion caused by the liquid when in the free flow condition as viewed within the field of view of the image sensor.
4. The flow meter according to claim 1, wherein the at least one processor updates the reference image by multiplying each pixel of the reference image by a first constant and adding a corresponding pixel of the image multiplied by a second constant.
5. The flow meter according to claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to identify a plurality of pixels of interest within the image.
6. The flow meter according to claim 5, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to determine a subset of pixels within the plurality of pixels of interest.
7. The flow meter according to claim 6, wherein each pixel of the plurality of pixels of interest is determined to be within the subset of pixels when there is a path to a baseline corresponding to the drip chamber.
8. The flow meter according to claim 7, wherein the baseline is a predetermined set of pixels within the image sensor.
9. The flow meter according to claim 6, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to perform a rotation operation on the subset of pixels.
10. The flow meter according to claim 9, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to estimate a volume of a drop within the drip chamber by counting a number of pixels within the rotated subset of pixels.
11. The flow meter according to claim 5, wherein the plurality of pixels of interest are identified by comparing the image to the reference image.
12. The flow meter according to claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to initialize the reference image.

17. The flow meter according to claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to update an array of integers in accordance with the image captured by the image sensor.
18. The flow meter according to claim 17, wherein each integer of the array of integers corresponds to a number of updates of a pixel of the reference image.
19. The flow meter according to claim 18, wherein the comparison of the image to the reference image only compares pixels within the image to pixels within the reference image if a respective integer of the array of integers indicates a respective pixel within the reference image has been updated at least a predetermined number of times.
20. The flow meter according to claim 1, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to: identify a drop in the image and a predetermined band near an edge of the drop; and initialize the reference image by setting each pixel of the reference image to the image unless it is within the drop or the predetermined band near the edge of the drop.
21. The flow meter according to claim 20, wherein the at least one processor is further configured to set a pixel of the reference image to a predetermined value if a corresponding pixel of the image is within the drop or the predetermined band near the edge of the drop.
22. The flow meter according to claim 21, wherein the corresponding pixel of the image has a location corresponding to a location of the pixel of the reference image.
23. The flow meter according to claim 1, wherein a baseline corresponds to an opening of the drip chamber.
