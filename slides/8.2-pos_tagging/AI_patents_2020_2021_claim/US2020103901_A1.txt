VEHICLE SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING SERVICES
</title>

<abstract>
A method for providing medical services to a patient, including: receiving a medical service request associated with a patient location; selecting an aircraft, located at an initial location, from a plurality of aircraft based on the patient location and the initial location; determining a flight plan for flying the aircraft to a region containing the patient location; at a sensor of the aircraft, sampling a first set of flight data; at a processor of the aircraft, autonomously controlling the aircraft to fly based on the flight plan and the set of flight data; selecting a landing location within the region; and landing the aircraft at the landing location, including: sampling a set of landing location data; determining a safety status of the landing location based on the set of landing location data; outputting a landing warning observable at the landing location; at the sensor, sampling a second set of flight data; and in response to determining the safety status and outputting the landing warning, autonomously controlling the aircraft to land at the landing location based on the second set of flight data.

<claims>
1. A method for providing services to a first user, comprising: receiving a service request associated with a first user location; automatically determining a first operation plan for controlling an aircraft to move to a region containing the first user location based on a first set of weather data; receiving a first set of operation data from a first sensor of the aircraft; controlling the aircraft to move based on the first operation plan and the first set of operation data; selecting a stopping location from a set of predetermined stopping locations within the region; stopping the aircraft at the stopping location, comprising: receiving a second set of operation data from a second sensor; receiving a confirmation input from a service provider; determining a safety status of the stopping location based on the second set of operation data and the confirmation input; and controlling the aircraft to stop at the stopping location based on the safety status; at the aircraft, receiving the first user; automatically determining a second operation plan for controlling the aircraft to move from the first region to a destination; and at the aircraft, transporting the first user, comprising: receiving a third set of operation data from the first sensor; and controlling the aircraft to move based on the second operation plan and the third set of operation data.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein controlling the aircraft to move based on the first operation plan and the first set of data comprises autonomously controlling the aircraft to move.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: landing at the destination; and at the destination, receiving a second user associated with a second service request.
4. The method of claim 1, further comprising communicating the stopping location to the first user.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the aircraft comprises a helicopter.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the aircraft does not land at the stopping location.
7. The method of claim 1, further comprising: while controlling the aircraft to move based on the first operation plan and the first set of operation data, receiving a second service request from a second user associated with a second user location, wherein the second user location is located within the region; and communicating the stopping location to the second user.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: while transporting a service provider to the region, receiving a second service request associated with a second user location; and in response to receiving a second service request, determining a priority for the first service request and a priority for the second service request.
9. The method of claim 8, comprising completing the second service request before the first service request when the priority of second service request is greater than the priority of the first service request.
10. The method of claim 1, further comprising: after selecting the stopping location, reserving the stopping location.
11. The method of claim 10, further comprising: after receiving the first user, releasing the reservation of the stopping location.
12. The method of claim 1, further comprising automatically generating a status report associated with operation of the aircraft.
13. The method of claim 12, further comprising automatically sending the status report to a third party.
14. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving an input from an occupant of the aircraft; and in response to receiving the input from the occupant, landing the aircraft.
14. The method of claim 14, wherein the input from the occupant comprises the confirmation input, wherein the confirmation input indicates that the stopping location is clear.
15. The method of claim 14, further comprising: in response to receiving the input from the occupant, dynamically determining a second stopping location based on aircraft operation parameters; and determining a third operation plan for controlling the aircraft to move to the second stopping location; wherein landing the aircraft comprises: controlling the aircraft to move based on the third operation plan.
17. The method of claim 14, wherein the occupant comprises the first user, wherein the input from the first user comprises an indication that flight conditions are too turbulent for at least one of: safety and comfort.
18. The method of claim 1, wherein the second sensor is located at the stopping location.
19. The method of claim 18, wherein the stopping location comprises a landing pad, wherein the status of the stopping location comprises an availability confirmation of the stopping location.
20. The method of claim 1, wherein the second sensor is configured to monitor current weather conditions.
