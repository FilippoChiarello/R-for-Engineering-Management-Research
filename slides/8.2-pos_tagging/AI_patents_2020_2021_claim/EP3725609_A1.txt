<title>
CALIBRATING METHOD AND DEVICE FOR VEHICLE ANTI-COLLISION PARAMETERS, VEHICLE CONTROLLER AND STORAGE MEDIUM
</title>

<abstract>
Disclosed are a method and apparatus for calibrating vehicle anti-collision parameters and a computer storage medium for implementing the method. The method for calibrating the vehicle anti-collision parameters comprises the following steps: setting a standard value of the latest time to activate braking TTAB and a standard value of the latest time to activate steering TTAS of a present vehicle; determining a calibrated value of TTAB and a calibrated value of TTAS; and combining the standard value of TTAB and the standard value of TTAS with respective corresponding calibrated values to determine a corrected value of TTAB and a corrected value of TTAS. Since the corresponding corrected value of TTAB and the corresponding corrected value of TTAS may be self-adaptively determined, driving safety and user experience are improved.
