</title>

<abstract>
According to an embodiment, there is provided a semiconductor device including a plurality of operation circuits each including a multiplier including a first input terminal and a second input terminal and configured to calculate a product of a value input via the first input terminal and a value input via the second input terminal, and an accumulator configured to integrate an output of the multiplier and output an integrated value that is obtained by integrating output values of the multiplier. The plurality of operation circuits are divided into groups by two manners, where by the first manner multiple operation circuits are configured to receive a common first value via the respective first input terminals, and by the second manner multiple operation circuits are configured to receive a common second value via the respective second input terminals.
