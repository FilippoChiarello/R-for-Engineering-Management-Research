<title>
System and method for content monitoring and filtering to improve network efficiency
</title>

<abstract>
A system and method of conserving network bandwidth by controlling access to resources. A filtering service determines if a resource should be blocked or allowed to pass between computers on the network based on information about the resource including the path and any query parameters in the URI along with any available metadata about the resource. The metadata may be retrieved from the remote hose, generated based on the content of the resource, or any combination thereof. One or more filtering algorithms may be engaged to compare the information about the resource to filtering rules to determine whether access to the resource is allowed. The information about the resource, and the result of the filtering algorithm may be stored to reduce the time required to make future determinations for the same resource, or for similar resources.

<claims>
1. A method, comprising: capturing input from a user specifying a request for a video resource stored on a remote computer using a network client application executing on a local computer, wherein the video resource has associated with it a resource identifier that includes a name of the remote computer, a path specifying a location of the resource on the remote computer, and a query string representing data to be sent to the remote computer, and wherein the network client application includes a monitoring module with rules programmed to determine whether the request should be evaluated by a filtering service running on a filtering computer; using the monitoring module executing on the local computer to determine that the request for the video resource should be evaluated by the filtering service; using the filtering service to accept a request for a filtering determination sent from the monitoring module, wherein the request for the filtering determination includes data specifying at least one type of determination to make with respect to the video resource; determining a filtering algorithm using the filtering service, the filtering algorithm selected from one or more algorithms programmed to determine whether the video resource will be allowed to pass through the computer network from the remote computer to the local computer; obtaining one or more filtering parameter values using the request for the filtering determination, wherein the filtering parameter values include at least the resource identifier and metadata about the video resource; executing the filtering algorithm using the filtering service and the filtering parameter values, wherein the algorithm is programmed to determine a filtering result specifying that the video resource should be blocked from traveling over the computer network from the remote computer to the local computer; and using the monitoring module to block the network client application from accessing the video resource.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein obtaining one or more filtering parameter values includes retrieving metadata about the video resource using the filtering service.
3. The method of claim 1, comprising: retrieving the video resource from the remote server, using the filtering service; extracting one or more individual frames from the video resource as one or more individual image files using the filtering service; comparing the one or more individual image files to one or more predefined patterns associated with the type of determination requested in the request for a filtering determination using the filtering service; and using the filtering service to generate a confidence level for each of the one or more predefined patterns compared using the filtering service, the confidence level indicating a likelihood that the individual frames from the video resource include a the corresponding predefined pattern.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the request for the video resource includes parameters specifying that the request for the video resource and any resulting response are to be encrypted, and wherein the monitoring module intercepts the request from the network client application and engages the filtering service before the request is encrypted.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the monitoring module blocks the network client application from accessing the video resource by indicating to the network client application that the video resource does not exist on the remote computer.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the filtering result includes a location of a blocked access resource, and wherein the monitoring module blocks the network client application from accessing the video resource by redirecting the network client application to request the blocked access resource instead of the video resource requested by the user.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the filtering service is programmed to determine the filtering algorithm at least based on the path of the video resource, the type of determination specified in the request for the filtering determination, and optionally on the query string of the video resource.
8. The method of claim 1, wherein the filtering algorithm compares aspects of the resource identifier and the metadata with one or more rules associated with type of determination to make, and wherein the algorithm is programmed to evaluate at least the path, the request for the filtering determination, the metadata, and optionally the query string.
