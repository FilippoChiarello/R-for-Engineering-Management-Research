MESIAL TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY CLASSIFIER BASED ON VOLUME AND SHAPE OF SUBCORTICAL BRAIN REGIONS
</title>

<abstract>
In one embodiment, a method that determine parameters corresponding to shape and volume of the one or more brain structures from the one or more meshes (36) and provides the parameters to a classifier to estimate a probability of a brain abnormality based on the parameters.
</abstract>

<claims>
At least the following is claimed:
1 . A non-transitory computer readable medium (54) comprising instructions that, when executed by one or more processors (48), causes the one or more processors to: receive one or more meshes corresponding to one or more structures of a brain
(34);
determine parameters corresponding to shape and volume of the one or more brain structures from the one or more meshes (36); and
provide the parameters to a classifier to estimate a probability of a brain abnormality based on the parameters (38).
2. The non-transitory computer readable medium of the preceding claim, wherein the instructions cause the one or more processors to receive one or more meshes corresponding to sub-cortical structures of the brain.
3. The non-transitory computer readable medium of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the instructions cause the one or more processors to receive one or more meshes corresponding to sub-cortical structures and cortical structures of the brain.
4. The non-transitory computer readable medium of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the instructions cause the one or more processors to receive one or more meshes corresponding to a limbic system and basal ganglia of the brain.
5. The non-transitory computer readable medium of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the instructions cause the one or more processors to receive one or more meshes corresponding to one or any combination of a hippocampus, amygdala, globus pallidus, lateral ventricle, putamen, thalamus, caudate, and nucleus accumbens.
6. The non-transitory computer readable medium of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the one or more meshes each comprise a shape-constrained, deformable brain model (24) that comprises one or more triangular meshes, the one or more meshes adapted to a magnetic resonance imaging scan (32) of a subject.
7. The non-transitory computer readable medium of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the instructions cause the one or more processors to determine the parameters by:
measuring the volume;
computing three principle inertias, a sphericity index, a surface area of a convex hull, an inverse value of the surface area; and
determining bilateral asymmetry indices and asymmetry in dominant inertias.
8. The non-transitory computer readable medium of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the instructions further cause the one or more processors to estimate the probability of the brain abnormality.
9. The non-transitory computer readable medium of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the brain abnormality corresponds to epilepsy.
10. A system (44), comprising:
a memory (54) comprising instructions (60); and
one or more processors (48) configured by the instructions to:
receive one or more meshes corresponding to one or more structures of a brain (64);
determine parameters corresponding to shape and volume of the one or more brain structures from the one or more meshes (64); and
estimate a probability of a brain abnormality based on the parameters
(66).
1 1 . The system of the preceding claim, wherein the one or more processors are further configured by the instructions to adapt the one or more meshes comprising a shape-constrained, deformable brain model (24) to a magnetic resonance imaging scan (32) of a subject.
12. The system of any one of the preceding system claims, wherein the one or more processors are further configured by the instructions to receive the one or more meshes corresponding to sub-cortical structures of the brain, or sub-cortical structures and cortical structures of the brain.
13. The system of any one of the preceding system claims, wherein the one or more processors are further configured by the instructions to determine the parameters by: measuring the volume;
computing three principle inertias, a sphericity index, a surface area of a convex hull, an inverse value of the surface area; and
determining bilateral asymmetry indices and asymmetry in dominant inertias.
14. The system of any one of the preceding system claims, wherein the estimate is based on one of a classification of a probability of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy for a subject, a classification of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy of the subject compared to healthy subjects (40), a classification of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy of the subject compared to subjects with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and no imaging confirmation, a classification of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy of the subject compared to subjects with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with imaging confirmation, or laterality of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy of the subject (42).
15. A method (70) implemented by one or more processors, the method comprising:
at the one or more processors:
receiving one or more meshes corresponding to one or more structures of a brain (72); determining parameters corresponding to shape and volume of the one or more brain structures from the one or more meshes (74); and estimating a probability of a brain abnormality based on the parameters (76).
