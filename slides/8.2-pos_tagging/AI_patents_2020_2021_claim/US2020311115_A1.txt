METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR MAPPING TEXT PHRASES TO A TAXONOMY
</title>

<abstract>
There is provided systems and methods for mapping of text phrases to a taxonomy. In an aspect, the method including: receiving the corpus and the taxonomy; mapping the text phrases in the corpus to a set of word embeddings in a word embedding space, where each sequence of word embeddings corresponds to individual words in one of the text phrases; vectorizing the taxonomy to a set of node embeddings in a node embedding vector space; mapping the set of word embeddings to the set of node embeddings using a mapping function, the mapping function outputting points in the node embedding space associated with sequences in the word embeddings; and outputting the mapping function.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for mapping of text phrases in a corpus of biomedical data to a biomedical taxonomy, the method comprising: receiving the corpus of biomedical data and the biomedical taxonomy; mapping the text phrases in the corpus to a set of word embeddings in a word embedding space, where each sequence of word embeddings corresponds to individual words in one of the text phrases; vectorizing the taxonomy to a set of node embeddings in a node embedding vector space, the taxonomy comprises a graph with concepts at each vertex and relationships between respective concepts at the edges connecting respective vertices mapping the set of word embeddings to the vectorized set of node embeddings using a mapping function, the mapping function outputting points in the node embedding space associated with sequences in the word embeddings, the mapping function determined using a trained machine learning model, the machine learning model taking as input the set of word embeddings and the set of node embeddings and trained using phrase-concept pairs previous labelled for at least a portion of the taxonomy; and outputting the mapping function.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising pre-processing the corpus, the pre-processing comprising at least one of splitting phrases into words, splitting sentences, adding spaces around punctuation marks, changing characters to lowercase, reformatting to one sentence per line, and concatenating files.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein mapping the text phrases in the corpus to a set of word embeddings comprises performing at least one of GloVe and fastText.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein vectorizing the taxonomy to the vectorized set of node embeddings comprises performing node2vec embedding comprising: starting on the edges from each vertex and stopping at a vertex after a fixed number of steps, wherein each vertex visited during the steps is recorded as part of the graph neighbourhood.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model comprises a convolutional neural network, the convolutional neural network comprising applying convolutional filters to the input vectors to generate feature maps, feeding the feature maps into a pooling layer, and projecting the output of the pooling layer to obtain an output of a reduced dimension.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the machine learning model comprises a bidirectional long short term memory network, the bidirectional long short term memory network comprising multiple hidden cells followed by a projection layer.
7. A system for mapping of text phrases in a corpus of biomedical data to a biomedical taxonomy, the system comprising one or more processors and memory, the memory storing the corpus and taxonomy, the one or more processors in communication with the memory and configured to execute: an input module to receive the corpus of biomedical data and the biomedical taxonomy; a corpus module to map the text phrases in the corpus to a set of word embeddings in a word embedding space, where each sequence of word embeddings corresponds to individual words in one of the text phrases; a taxonomy module to vectorize the taxonomy to a set of node embeddings in a node embedding vector space, the taxonomy comprises a graph with concepts at each vertex and relationships between respective concepts at the edges connecting respective vertices; a mapping module to map the set of word embeddings to the vectorized set of node embeddings using a mapping function, the mapping function outputting points in the node embedding space associated with sequences in the word embeddings, the mapping function determined using a trained machine learning model, the machine learning model taking as input the set of word embeddings and the set of node embeddings and trained using phrase-concept pairs previous labelled for at least a portion of the taxonomy; and an output module to output the mapping function.
