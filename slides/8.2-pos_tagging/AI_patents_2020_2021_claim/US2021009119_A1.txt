METHOD AND CONTROL DEVICE FOR A SYSTEM FOR THE CONTROL OF A MOTOR VEHICLE
</title>

<abstract>
A method for controlling a motor vehicle (10) traveling on a road (12) in a current lane (14) is presented. The road (12) has at least one further lane (16) which is adjacent to the current lane (14) of the motor vehicle (10). The method comprises the following steps: A driving maneuver graph is generated and/or received, which contains information about at least two different driving maneuvers for the motor vehicle (10). One of the at least two possible driving maneuvers is selected by means of a machine learning module (36) which applies a machine learning method to the driving maneuver graph. A control device (30) for a system (26) for the control of a motor vehicle (10) is also proposed.

1. 1-14. (canceled)
15. Method for controlling a motor vehicle traveling on a road in a current lane, the road having at least one further lane which is adjacent to the current lane of the motor vehicle, comprising the following steps: Generating and/or receiving a driving maneuver graph containing information about at least two different possible driving maneuvers for the motor vehicle, and; Selecting one of the at least two possible driving maneuvers by means of a machine learning module which applies a machine learning method to the driving maneuver graph.
16. Method according to claim 15, wherein the machine learning module comprises an artificial neural network, in particular a graph neural network (GNN).
17. Method according to claim 15, wherein the driving maneuver graph provides information about free areas of the road, occupied areas of the road which are occupied by other road users, lane keeping areas of the road, in which a lane change between the two lanes is not possible, and/or change areas of the road, in which a lane change between the two lanes is possible.
18. Method according to claim 17, wherein at least one space-time polygon corresponding to the current lane, at least one space-time polygon corresponding to the at least one further lane, and at least one space-time polygon corresponding to the occupied areas is determined, wherein the space-time polygons corresponding to the free areas of the two lanes are determined by means of polygon clipping, in particular those polygons that correspond to the occupied areas are each removed from the polygons that correspond to one of the two lanes in order to determine the free areas.
19. Method according to claim 17, wherein at least one vertex of the driving maneuver graph is each assigned to the free areas, the change areas, and/or the lane keeping areas.
20. Method according to claim 18, wherein at least one vertex of the driving maneuver graph is each assigned to the free areas, the change areas, and/or the lane keeping areas.
21. Method according to claim 19, wherein the vertices of the driving maneuver graph are preferably connected in pairs to an edge, in particular a directed edge, if a driving maneuver between the corresponding free areas, change areas, and/or lane keeping areas is possible, which are assigned to the vertices.
22. Method according to claim 20, wherein the vertices of the driving maneuver graph are preferably connected in pairs to an edge, in particular a directed edge, if a driving maneuver between the corresponding free areas (Bf), change areas, and/or lane keeping areas is possible, which are assigned to the vertices.
23. Method according to claim 19, wherein the vertices and/or the edges each have at least one attribute and/or the driving maneuver graph has at least one global attribute.
24. Method according to claim 23, wherein the machine learning module is used to select the possible driving maneuver whose assigned sum of the attributes of the edges and/or the attributes of the vertices is minimal or maximal.
25. Method according to claim 17, wherein it is determined whether the motor vehicle can reach the free areas, the lane keeping areas, and/or the change areas, in particular wherein a current speed of the motor vehicle, a maximum deceleration of the motor vehicle, a maximum acceleration of the motor vehicle, and/or a speed limit are taken into account.
26. Method according to claim 15, wherein at least the current lane and/or the at least one further lane are or is transformed into a Frenet-Serret coordinate system.
27. Method according to claim 15, wherein the motor vehicle is controlled according to the selected driving maneuver and/or information is given to the driver on the basis of the selected driving maneuver.
28. Control device for a system for controlling a motor vehicle or for a motor vehicle, the control device being designed to carry out a method according to claim 15.
29. Method for controlling a motor vehicle traveling on a road in a current lane, the road having at least one further lane which is adjacent to the current lane of the motor vehicle, comprising the following steps: generating and/or receiving a driving maneuver graph containing information about at least two different possible driving maneuvers for the motor vehicle, and; selecting one of the at least two possible driving maneuvers by means of a machine learning module which applies a machine learning method to the driving maneuver graph, wherein the driving maneuver graph provides information about free areas of the road, occupied areas of the road which are occupied by other road users, lane keeping areas of the road, in which a lane change between the two lanes is not possible, and/or change areas of the road, in which a lane change between the two lanes is possible, wherein at least one space-time polygon corresponding to the current lane, at least one space-time polygon corresponding to the at least one further lane, and at least one space-time polygon corresponding to the occupied areas is determined, wherein the space-time polygons corresponding to the free areas of the two lanes are determined by means of polygon clipping.
30. Method according to claim 29, wherein the motor vehicle is controlled according to the selected driving maneuver and/or information is given to the driver on the basis of the selected driving maneuver.
31. Method according to claim 29, wherein it is determined whether the motor vehicle can reach the free areas, the lane keeping areas, and/or the change areas, in particular wherein a current speed of the motor vehicle, a maximum deceleration of the motor vehicle, a maximum acceleration of the motor vehicle, and/or a speed limit are taken into account.
