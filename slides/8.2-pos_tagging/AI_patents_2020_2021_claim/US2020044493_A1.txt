CHARGING PORTS WITH INTEGRATED CONTACTLESS COMMUNICATION UNITS
</title>

<abstract>
Embodiments discussed herein refer to electric vehicle charging ports having integrated contactless communication units (CCUs). The electric vehicle charging ports include male and female connector assemblies that can be coupled together in a manner that enables consistent and reliable operation of contactless communications and power transfer. The connector integrates power and alignment such that when two connector assemblies are coupled together, power connections are made in combination with establishing contactless communications links between counterpart CCUs in both connector assemblies. The fixed alignment of the connector assemblies ensures that contactless communication channels, spanning between the connector assemblies, are aligned to enable consistent and reliable operation of contactless communications. The CCUs, which conduct contactless communications, may be integrated in the connector assemblies at fixed positions that enable CCUs of one connector assembly to be aligned with CCUs of another connector assembly when they are coupled together.

1. 1-25. (canceled)
26. A method comprising: authenticating an electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) with a vehicle by transmitting authentication credentials via a contactless communications link to the vehicle, wherein the contactless communications link is established by precise alignment of at least one contactless connector unit (CCU) associated with the EVSE with at least one reciprocal CCU associated with the vehicle; receiving vehicle log data from the vehicle via the contactless communication link after the EVSE has been authenticated to the vehicle; storing the received vehicle log data in a data storage; and transmitting the received vehicle log data to a remote server.
27. The method of claim 26, further comprising transferring power from the EVSE to the vehicle via a connector coupled to the vehicle, wherein the transfer of power occurs simultaneously with receipt of the vehicle log data.
28. The method of claim 27, wherein the connector comprises the at least once CCU.
29. The method of claim 26, further comprising transmitting a software update to the vehicle via the contactless communications link.
30. The method of claim 26, wherein the vehicle log data comprises environmental inputs collected by the vehicle during driving events.
31. The method of claim 30, wherein the environmental inputs comprise data collected by at least one sensor associated with the vehicle.
32. The method of claim 26, wherein the vehicle log data comprises operational states executed by the vehicle during driving events.
33. The method of claim 32, wherein the operational states comprise one of driver or autonomous control inputs to control the vehicle.
34. The method of claim 26, wherein the vehicle log data is operative to serve as a data set for autonomous vehicle software analytics.
35. The method of claim 26, wherein the precise alignment of the at least one CCU associated with the EVSE with the at least one reciprocal CCU associated with the vehicle is established using a mechanical connector interface used to establish a connection between the EVSE and the vehicle.
36. A method managing data contained by a vehicle, comprising: authenticating an external system by processing an authentication credential received via a contactless communications link, wherein the contactless communications link is established by precise alignment of at least one contactless connector unit (CCU) associated with the vehicle with at least one reciprocal CCU associated with the external system; determining an access level based on the authentication credential; and transmitting, from a data storage, vehicle log data commensurate with the determined access level to the external system via the contactless communications link.
37. The method of claim 36, further comprising receiving a software update via the contactless communications link.
38. The method of claim 36, wherein the external system is selected from electric vehicle supply equipment, a law enforcement system, and a service and diagnostic system.
39. The method of claim 36, further comprising receiving power from the external system via a connector coupled to the vehicle, wherein the receipt of power occurs simultaneously with transfer of the vehicle log data.
40. The method of claim 36, wherein the connector comprises the at least once CCU.
41. The method of claim 36, wherein the vehicle log data comprises environmental inputs collected by the vehicle during driving events.
42. The method of claim 41, wherein the environmental inputs comprise data collected by at least one sensor associated with the vehicle.
43. The method of claim 36, wherein the vehicle log data comprises operational states executed by the vehicle during driving events.
44. The method of claim 43, wherein the operational states comprise one of driver or autonomous control inputs to control the vehicle.
45. The method of claim 36, wherein the vehicle log data is operative to serve as a data set for autonomous vehicle software analytics.
46. The method of claim 36, wherein the vehicle log data is operative to serve as a data set for law enforcement.
47. The method of claim 36, wherein the precise alignment of the at least one CCU associated with the vehicle with the at least one reciprocal CCU associated with the external system is established using a mechanical connector interface used to establish a connection between the vehicle and the external system.
