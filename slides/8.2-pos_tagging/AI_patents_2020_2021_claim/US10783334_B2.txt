Embedded sensor chips in polymer-based coatings
</title>

<abstract>
Systems, methods, and electronic circuits facilitating embedded sensor chips in polymer-based coatings are provided. In one example, a method comprises fabricating an electronic circuit, the electronic circuit comprising one or more semiconductor devices, one or more sensors, and a communication element; encapsulating the electronic circuit within an insulator, resulting in an encapsulated circuit; and dispersing the encapsulated circuit into a lacquer solution comprising a polymer carrier and a solvent.

<claims>
1. A method comprising: fabricating an electronic circuit, the electronic circuit comprising one or more semiconductor devices, one or more sensors, and a communication element; encapsulating the electronic circuit within an insulator, resulting in an encapsulated electronic circuit; and dispersing the encapsulated electronic circuit into a lacquer solution comprising a polymer carrier and a solvent.
2. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving a silicon on insulator substrate comprising a carrier silicon substrate, a buried insulator layer adjacent to the carrier silicon substrate, and a silicon layer adjacent to the buried insulator layer and opposite the carrier silicon substrate; fabricating the electronic circuit from the silicon layer; applying an insulator layer onto the electronic circuit, resulting in the encapsulated electronic circuit; applying a handle substrate to the insulator layer; removing the carrier silicon substrate; and immersing the handle substrate and the encapsulated electronic circuit in a wet solution, thereby removing the handle substrate from the encapsulated electronic circuit.
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising: coating the encapsulated electronic circuit with a monolayer of alkyl trimethoxysilane, resulting in a coated electronic circuit; and rinsing the coated electronic circuit with an organic solvent.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the polymer carrier of the lacquer solution comprises nitrocellulose and the solvent of the lacquer solution is from the group consisting of ethyl acetate and butyl acetate.
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising coating the encapsulated electronic circuit with polyethylene oxide end-capped with trialkoxysilane.
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the polymer carrier of the lacquer solution comprises polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyethylene oxide diacrylate dissolved in water.
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the one or more sensors comprise a plurality of sensors of respective ones of a plurality of sensor types, and the method further comprises: receiving, by a device operatively coupled to a processor, respective measurements from the plurality of sensors via the communication element; and classifying, by the device, the measurements according to their corresponding sensor types using a machine learning algorithm based on historical data associated with the plurality of sensor types.
8. The method of claim 7, further comprising: providing, by the device, the respective measurements from the plurality of sensors to a cloud computing service; and training, by the device, the machine learning algorithm using the respective measurements from the plurality of sensors.
9. The method of claim 1, further comprising: receiving, by a device operatively coupled to a processor, measurement data from the one or more sensors via the communication element; and classifying, by the device, the measurement data as a data type selected from the group consisting of genuine sensor data and faulty sensor data using a machine learning algorithm.
