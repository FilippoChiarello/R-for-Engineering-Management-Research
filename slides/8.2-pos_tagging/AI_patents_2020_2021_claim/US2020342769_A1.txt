SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PREDICTING FLIGHT SAFETY EVENTS USING A LEARNING-BASED MODEL
</title>

<abstract>
Systems and methods for predicting flight safety events using a learning-based model are disclosed. The method may include: receiving, by a processor, flight data from an aircraft and contextual information of a flight for the aircraft; identifying, by the processor, patterns in the received flight data and contextual information that correspond to a specific type of event that occurred during the flight; computing, by the processor, a probability of an occurrence of an event for the flight based on the identified patterns in the received flight data and contextual information; and sending, by the processor, an alert to the aircraft when the computed probability of an occurrence of an event is above a predetermined threshold.

<claims>
1. A computer-implemented method for predicting flight safety events using a learning-based model, the method comprising: receiving, by a processor, flight data from an aircraft and contextual information of a flight for the aircraft; identifying, by the processor, patterns in the received flight data and contextual information that correspond to a specific type of event that occurred during the flight; computing, by the processor, a probability of an occurrence of an event for the flight based on the identified patterns in the received flight data and contextual information; and sending, by the processor, an alert to the aircraft when the computed probability of an occurrence of an event is above a predetermined threshold.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the identifying patterns comprises utilizing a machine learning model.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein the machine learning model is a prediction model, and further comprise training the prediction model based on predetermined intervals.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the contextual information include at least one of traffic data, weather data, runway data, restrictions data, and communications with air traffic control (ATC).
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the flight data include at least one of flight path data, flight data management (FDM) data, flight management system (FMS) data, and quick access recorder (QAR) data.
6. The method of claim 1, wherein the event is an occurrence of a hazard event, and the alert includes the hazard and mitigation suggestions.
7. The method of claim 6, wherein the hazard is at least one of insufficient stopping distance and loss of control.
8. A computer system for predicting flight safety events using a learning-based model, the computer system comprising: at least one memory having processor-readable instructions stored therein; and at least one processor configured to access the memory and execute the processor-readable instructions, which when executed by the processor configured the processor to perform a plurality of functions, including functions for: receiving flight data from an aircraft and contextual information of a flight for the aircraft; identifying patterns in the received flight data and contextual information that correspond to a specific type of event that occurred during the flight; computing a probability of an occurrence of an event for the flight based on the identified patterns in the received flight data and contextual information; and sending an alert to the aircraft when the computed probability of an occurrence of an event is above a predetermined threshold.
9. The system of claim 8, wherein the function of identifying patterns further comprise utilizing a machine learning model.
10. The system of claim 9, wherein the machine learning model is a prediction model, and further includes the function of training prediction model based on predetermined intervals.
11. The system of claim 8, wherein the contextual information include at least one of traffic data, weather data, runway data, restrictions data, and communications with air traffic control (ATC).
12. The system of claim 8, wherein the flight data include at least one of flight path data, flight data management (FDM) data, flight management system (FMS) data, and quick access recorder (QAR) data.
13. The system of claim 8, wherein the event is an occurrence of a hazard event, and the alert includes the hazard and mitigation suggestions.
14. The system of claim 13, wherein the hazard is at least one of insufficient stopping distance and loss of control.
15. A non-transitory computer-readable medium containing instructions for predicting flight safety events using a learning-based model, the non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by at least one processor, configure the at least one processor to perform: receiving, by a processor, flight data from an aircraft and contextual information of a flight for the aircraft; identifying, by the processor, patterns in the received flight data and contextual information that correspond to a specific type of event that occurred during the flight; computing, by the processor, a probability of an occurrence of an event for the flight based on the identified patterns in the received flight data and contextual information; and sending, by the processor, an alert to the aircraft when the computed probability of an occurrence of an event is above a predetermined threshold.
16. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the identifying patterns comprises utilizing a machine learning model.
17. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 16, wherein the machine learning model is a prediction model, and further comprising training the prediction model based on predetermined intervals.
18. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the contextual information include at least one of traffic data, weather data, runway data, restrictions data, and communications with air traffic control (ATC).
19. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the flight data include at least one of flight path data, flight data management (FDM) data, flight management system (FMS) data, and quick access recorder (QAR) data.
20. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 15, wherein the event is an occurrence of a hazard event, and the alert includes the hazard and mitigation suggestions.
