ASSESSING CONDITIONS OF INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT AND PROCESSES
</title>

<abstract>
A method for training a machine-learning model to assess at least one condition of industrial equipment, and/or at least one condition of a process running in an industrial plant, based on measurement data gathered by a plurality of sensors, includes: obtaining a plurality of records of measurement data that correspond to a variety of operating situations and a variety of conditions; obtaining, for each record of measurement data, a label that represents a condition in the operating situation characterized by the record of measurement data; and determining a plausibility of at least one record of measurement data, and/or a plausibility of at least one label, based at least in part on a comparison with at least one other record of measurement data, with at least one other label, and/or with additional information about the industrial equipment, and/or about the industrial plant where the industrial equipment resides, and/or about the process.

<claims>
1. A method for training a machine-learning model to assess at least one condition of industrial equipment, and/or at least one condition of a process running in an industrial plant, based on measurement data gathered by a plurality of sensors, the method comprising: obtaining a plurality of records of measurement data that correspond to a variety of operating situations and a variety of conditions; obtaining, for each record of measurement data, a label that represents a condition in the operating situation characterized by the record of measurement data; determining a plausibility of at least one record of measurement data, and/or a plausibility of at least one label, based at least in part on a comparison with at least one other record of measurement data, with at least one other label, and/or with additional information about the industrial equipment, and/or about the industrial plant where the industrial equipment resides, and/or about the process; and in response to the plausibility meeting at least one predetermined criterion, including the record of measurement data and the label in a set of training data on which the machine-learning model is to be trained.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the comparison includes measurement values of a same physical quantity acquired by different sensors in different places within a sphere of influence of the industrial equipment.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the industrial equipment comprises a pump, and wherein the record of measurement data comprises measurement data of noise and/or vibration acquired in an inlet area of the pump, and measurement data of noise and/or vibration acquired in an outlet area of the pump.
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the comparison includes measurement values of different physical quantities that are related to one another by an intended operation of the industrial equipment.
5. The method of claim 4, wherein the industrial equipment comprises a pump, and wherein the different physical quantities comprise at least two of the following: noise, vibration, output mass flow, output pressure, electrical power consumption.
6. The method of claim 1, further comprising: in response to determining that the plausibility fails to meet the criterion, prompting a human expert for a decision whether to: accept a combination of the measurement data and the label as plausible with or without amendment of the measurement data and/or of the label by the expert; or discard the measurement data and the label.
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising: comparing the record of measurement data, and/or the label, to at least one other record of measurement data, and/or to at least one other label, obtained for another instance of a same kind of equipment within the same industrial plant; and presenting a result of the comparison to the expert when prompting the expert for the decision.
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising: optimizing a set of parameters that characterize a behavior of the machine-learning model such that the machine-learning model maps the records of measurement data in the set of training data to their respective labels with sufficient accuracy.
9. A set of training data, and/or a set of parameters, obtained by the method of claim 1.
10. A method for assessing at least one condition of industrial equipment, and/or at least one condition of a process running in an industrial plant, based on measurement data gathered by a plurality of sensors, the method comprising: obtaining at least one record of measurement data that describes an operating situation of the equipment, and/or of the process; obtaining a plurality of trained machine-learning models that are each configured to map the record of measurement data to an indication of the condition; determining, for each of the trained machine-learning models, a figure of fitness to assess a situation described by the record of measurement data; selecting at least one trained machine-learning model whose figure of fitness meets a predetermined criterion; and mapping the record of measurement data to a sought condition using the at least one selected trained machine-learning model.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein the determining the figure of fitness comprises: determining a measure for a quality of the measurement data, and/or for a type and/or a strength of any disturbances contained therein; and determining the figure of fitness for a trained machine-learning model based at least in part on the fitness of the trained machine-learning model to process measurement data that are of the quality, and/or that contain disturbances of the type and/or the strength.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein the determining the measure for the quality of the measurement data comprises: supplying the measurement data to a further trained machine-learning model that is configured to produce a classification value, and/or a regression value, as a measure for the quality.
13. The method of claim 10, wherein the selection of the at least one trained machine-learning model is further based on a requirement for an accuracy and/or for a confidence of the assessment of the condition.
14. The method of claim 10, further comprising: before obtaining the record of measurement data using a plurality of sensors, selecting a subset of the plurality of sensors according to a database that stores associations between equipment whose condition is to be assessed and sensors that are suitable for assessing the condition of this equipment.
15. The method of claim 10, wherein an interval at which the obtaining of records of measurement data is repeated is determined based on a previous history of the assessed condition.
16. The method of claim 10, further comprising: in response to the determined condition meeting a predetermined criterion, flagging the equipment for maintenance and/or repair, and/or for future more frequent inspection; changing operating parameters of the equipment to ease a load on the equipment; changing operating parameters of the process to move the process to a stable state; and/or shutting down the equipment, and/or the process, to prevent further damage.
17. The method of claim 10, further comprising: selecting at least one sensor from which to obtain further measurement data, and/or a piece of equipment to which further measurement data are to relate, based at least in part on an already determined plausibility, and/or on an already assessed condition.
18. The method of claim 10, wherein the plurality of sensors comprises sensors mounted on a service robot that is configured to move between different pieces of equipment, and/or between different processes, in the industrial plant.
19. The method of claim 18, further comprising: determining a location of the service robot in the industrial plant, and/or an identification of the equipment that is being sensed by the sensors of the service robot, based on a match between measurement data captured by the sensors and pre-stored information about a layout of the industrial plant, and/or about an inventory of the equipment installed in the plant.
20. A computer program, comprising machine-readable instructions that, when executed by one or more computers, cause the one or more computers to perform the method according to claim 1.
21. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, and/or a downloadable product, with the set of training data and/or the set of parameters of claim 9.
22. A computer, equipped with the set of training data and/or the set of parameters of claim 9.
23. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, and/or a downloadable product, with the computer program of claim 20.
24. A computer, equipped with the computer program of claim 20.
25. A computer, equipped with the storage medium and/or downloadable product of claim 21.
