## Learning goals

By the end of the module, you will be able to...

--

- gain insight from data

--
- gain insight from data, **reproducibly**

--
- gain insight from data, reproducibly, **using modern programming tools and techniques**

--
- gain insight from data, reproducibly **and collaboratively**, using modern programming tools and techniques

--
- gain insight from data, reproducibly and collaboratively, using modern programming tools and techniques, **to answer to key intelligence topics**

## Reproducibility checklist

.question[
What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?
]

--

Near-term goals:

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done? 

--

Long-term goals:

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

---

## Toolkit for reproducibility

- Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R
- Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ R Markdown
- Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

## R and RStudio

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/r-logo.png", error = FALSE)
```
- R is an open-source statistical **programming language**
- R is also an environment for statistical computing and graphics
- It's easily extensible with *packages*
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-logo.png", error = FALSE)
```
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R called an **IDE** (integrated development environment), e.g. *"I write R code in the RStudio IDE"*
- RStudio is not a requirement for programming with R, but it's very commonly used by R programmers and data scientists
]

## R packages

- **Packages** are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data<sup>1</sup>

- As of September 2020, there are over 16,000 R packages available on **CRAN** (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)<sup>2</sup>

- We're going to work with a small (but important) subset of these!

<sup>2</sup> [CRAN contributed packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/).

## Tour: R and RStudio

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tour-r-rstudio.png", error = FALSE)
```

---

## A short list (for now) of R essentials

- Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r eval=FALSE}
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

--

- Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

---

## R essentials (continued)

- Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

.small[
```{r eval=FALSE}
dataframe$var_name
```
]

--

- Object documentation can be accessed with `?`

```{r eval=FALSE}
?mean
```

---

## tidyverse

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="99%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidyverse.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
.center[.large[
[tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
]]

- The **tidyverse** is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science
- All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar
